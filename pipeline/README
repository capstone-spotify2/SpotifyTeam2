step 1: feature engineering

parameters: raw_data.csv(input, required) - the file contains the information about all the songs in database. Required informations are(in order): Current index, original index, song id, song name, artist, tag, path to the song lyrics txt file, song lyrics.

output.csv(output, optimal) - the file returns the features and tags needed for the future modeling step. 
by default: "features.csv"

n_features(int, input, optimal) - total number of features wanted for the modeling step.
by default: 250

run feature engineering:
python feature_engineering.py inputdata.csv [-f output.csv -n 100]



step 2: build model:
run model_training.py inputfeature.csv [-e est -d depth]


step 3: prediction:

# in your prediction file                                                                                                                                                                                                           

with open('path/to/file', 'rb') as f:
    rf = cPickle.load(f)


preds = rf.predict(new_X)
