<i>[Verse One]</i>
All I hear is raindrops
Falling on the rooftop
Oh baby tell me whyâd you have to go
Cause this pain I feel
It wont go away
And today
Iâm officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ainât no way
And today
Iâm officially missing you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh canât nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby say it stays on my mind
And I, Iâm officially

<i>[Verse Two]</i>
All I do is lay around
Two ears full of tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I donât even know you at all
I donât know you at all
Well, I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess itâs safe to say baby safe to say
That Iâm officially missing you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Well, I thought I could just get over you baby
But I see thatâs something I just canât do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just canât find a way
To let go of you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It's official
You know that Iâm missing you
Yeah yes
All I hear is raindrops
And Iâm officially missing you
