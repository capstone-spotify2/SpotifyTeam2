"How fast can you ride your bike?"
He asked that Sunday night
With a wild look in his eye
So I followed close behind
"How fast do fast cars drive?"
That's what I replied
"I don't stop at traffic lights
Yeah that's how fast I ride"

We used to ride at night
We used to glide on the west side
But he fell and broke his spine
So I just left him behind
Behind, behind, behind, behind

My old bicycle was a Ferrari
It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties
I tell the girls my bike is a Ferrari
My old bicycle was a Ferrari
It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties
I tell the girls my bike is a Ferrari

And how fast can you grow up
And are you grown up enough
To outgrow the things you love
And leave an old friend in the dust
Yeah I remember this one time
When I picked up my phone line
And I heard you on the other side
And you said "C'mon let's ride"

My old bicycle was a Ferrari
It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties
I tell the girls my bike is a Ferrari
My old bicycle was a Ferrari
It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties
I tell the girls my bike is a Ferrari

For worse or for better, we leave our friends behind
But then we remember we can't turn back the time
For worse or for better, we leave our friends behind
But then we remember we can't turn back the time
