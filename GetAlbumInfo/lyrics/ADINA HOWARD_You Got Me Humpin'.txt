Oh oh oh 
You got me humpin' day and night, oh baby 
Oh oh oh 
You got me humpin' day and night, oh baby 
(When you go let me know, so come and check the flow) 
Oh oh oh 
(Comin' from the west, west coast) 
You got me humpin' day and night, oh baby 
(When you go let me know, so come and check the flow) 
Oh oh oh 
(Comin' from the west, west coast) 
It's all about the dog in me 
It's all about the freak in me 
'Cause that's how we kick it on the west coast 
And if it's love that you want 
Then that's what I'll give 
(That is, if you can handle it) 
'Cause you know you got me humpin, yeah, yeah, yeah 
<i>[LSD:]</i>
Hey girl, how ya doin'? 
Damn, ya look fine 
All I need is one chance 
For me to make you mine 
Plus I'll wine and dine 
Even treat you right 
And I give you what you want 
All day and all night 
'Cause, uh, it's plain to see 
Ya need to be with me 
A night with LSD is like pure ecstasy 
So, yo, let me know how I can be down 
'Cause I got what you need 
When you humpin' around 
<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You got me humpin' day and night, oh baby 
(When you go let me know, so come and check the flow) 
Oh oh oh 
(Comin' from the west, west coast) 
You got me humpin' day and night, oh baby 
(When you go let me know, so come and check the flow) 
Oh oh oh 
(Comin' from the west, west coast) 
Baby, it's on tonight 
Everythang's gonna be alright 
Just don't be afraid of me 
See, I got what you want 
You got what I need, babe 
Ooh yeah, babe 
So come and take a ride with me 
<i>[Def Jeff:]</i>
Peeped her on the street 
In the drop-top Beamer 
Didn't have to ask her name 
Her license plate said Adina 
Cracked on the digits 
Said she had a man 
But gave me her beeper number 
So I knew she was wit' it 
Fly little honey with that west coast flavor 
She told me to leave a 6-9 when I page her 
That's a knee-deep 
Freak of the week 
I know it's all, word is bond 
To the break of dawn 
And I'm gone, baby 
<i>[Chorus 'til fade]</i>
