Tie up my hands tonight
Don't let me go
Binding my eyes from sight
Binding my soul
Take hold of me
Take hold of me
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Throw bones on the fire
Throw down control
Laying down the law
Lay me down slow
Take hold of me
Take hold of me
I give myself unto thee
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
I'm your one and only sacrifice
I'm your one and only sacrifice
Binding my soul
Don't let me go
I'm your one and only sacrifice
Don't let me go
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
