Iâm so lonely I wrote another song
Iâm stuck at home here while things move right along
She found love out there
Sheâs never looking back
I can not say the words
Cause my heart is turning black

You can make me eat those words
Or bring me back to life
You can make me out of my mind
You can make me realize
The meaning of my life
You can make me open my eyes

I really donât appreciate
The time she spent to look
I can count all the days on one hand
The amount of time it took
So doctor make her better
Make her half way sane
Donât underestimate
Her twisted little game

You can make me eat those words
Or bring me back to life
You can make me out of my mind
You can make me realize
The meaning of my life
You can make me open my eyes

Youâre just happy to be free
Of the life you had with me
Your cold hands and cold feet
Will now be warmed by someone else
While I sit here by myself
If you leave, you leave for good

You can make me eat those words
Or bring me back to life
You can make me out of my mind
You can make me realize
The meaning of my life
You
