Tower of Babel has fallen down again
Information disarray
I don't know who I should believe in
Everybody's an authority
Fragments don't count
They always end up falling through the cracks
Don't think out loud
Cause once it's out your mouth, can't take it back

Can't say all the little things
That I wanna tell you right now
I know you won't understand
But I gotta tell you somehow
And on and on and on I go
Connect the neck to what's below I know
Now your body language is broken, broken English

Lost inside communication breakdown
Better just read my lips
Come in clear when we get down
Iceberg, just the tip

My words get lost
Can you read the look that's on my face?
Wires get crossed
In communion with the human race

Can't say all the little things
That I wanna tell you right now
I know you won't understand
But I gotta tell you somehow
And on and on and on I go
Connect the neck to what's below I know
Now your body language is broken, broken English

Oooooooh oooooooooooh
Ooooooooooh ooooooooooooh
Oooooh nooooo...

Can't say all the little things
That I wanna tell you right now
I know you won't understand
But I gotta tell you somehow
And on and on and on I go
Connect the neck to what's below I know
Now your body language is broken, broken English
