Runnin' around like crazy
After our romance
Thinkin' about you baby
How there's still a chance
I know there's magic
Whenever you're around me
So much it makes me wanna sing

I'll use my imagination
In a novel way
To create a situation
One we both can play
I'll write the story
You'll be my inspiration
Just like two actors in a play

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Let's pretend
We're in another world
Livin' a fantasy
Let's pretend
Just another boy and girl
Falling in love
Let's pretend
Babe we'll remember when
Maybe we'll start again
Let's pretend
What we had will never end
Ooh ooh aah

I'm jumpin' right in now baby
With my body and soul
Everyone thinks I'm crazy
But I love you so
I know there's magic
Whenever you're around me
So much it makes me wanna...

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

Girl remember when
Do you remember when
Bring it back again
In all the love we made
I'm sure we saved some for
A rainy day

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
