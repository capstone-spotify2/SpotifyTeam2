The hands keep on turning, the pendulum just swings
Prisoners upon this rock, flying without wings
Captured in a moment, still the hours chimed
Joining closer as we sifted with the sands of time

Parallel dimension, guilts fall into place
Driven by an unseen force, swelling into space

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
At beyond the rainbow, cross the milkyway
Passengers without a choice, slowly turning grey

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
On through the night, shine on forever
Going insane as we ride the time machine

Waiting for no one, relative to none
Awnsering to not a thing, except the rising sun

Bouncing on this fabric, at the speed of light
Connecting points of futures past, is its only plight

Passengers without a choice, hanging by a string
Spending with a hands of time, flying without wings
