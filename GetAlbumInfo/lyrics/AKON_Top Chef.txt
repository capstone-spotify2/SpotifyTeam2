(Akon) (Gucci) (Akon) (Gucci)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm all in the kitchen call me the top chef
Servin' up these yams till there ain't none left,
Y'all niggas cooking babies,
I'm cooking straight chickens now who got the gravy,
Call me the top chef, keep the work and the baking soda on the top shelf,
And I'm drinking top shelf, (Gucci) Keep the work and the baking soda on the top shelf,

<i>[Verse:]</i>
What you're describing is a small time hustle...
I am surround it by heavy way she is a small town muscle...
A couple of mini staks packed up in that duffle...
And you see my body gone... watch me make a shuffel
Cause I ain't playing games with you nigga...
Staring up on your legs
Got all your game following my twitter...
If you are thinking you can do the same thing
Reconsider.
Table top, silver glass...
The same... smoke... traffic never stopping cause I got...
So when you see the po-po creeping, riding by slow you just walk by like
You don't know me (keep moving dog) walk by like you don't know me, (keep
Moving dog) you just need to walk by like you don't know me,

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm all in the kitchen call me the top chef
Servin' up these yams till there ain't none left,
Y'all niggas cooking babies,
I'm cooking straight chickens now who got the gravy,
Call me the top chef, keep the work and the baking soda on the top shelf,
And I'm drinking top shelf, keep the work and the baking soda on the top
Shelf
