Come Here baby 
You know you drive me up a wall the way you make good on all the 
nasty tricks you pull 
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love 
And it always seems you got somn' on your mind other than me 
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways 
You hear me 

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin' 
out to Hollywood 
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like 
feelin' bad looks good 

That kinda lovin' 
Turns a man to a slave 
That kinda lovin' 
Sends a man right to his grave... 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy 
You turn it on 
Then you're gone 
Yeah you drive me 
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby 
What can I do, honey 
I feel like the color blue... 

You're packin' up your stuff and talkin' like it's tough and tryin' 
to tell me that it's time to go 
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat 
And it's all a show 

That kind of lovin' 
Makes me wanna pull 
Down the shade, yeah 
That kind of lovin' 
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same 
<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'm losin' my mind, girl 
'Cause I'm goin' crazy 

I need your love, honey 
I need your love 

Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy 
You turn it on 
Then you're gone 
Yeah you drive me 
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby 
I'm losin' my mind, girl 
ÃÃause I'm goin' crazy 
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby 
You turn it on, then your gone 
Yeah you drive me
