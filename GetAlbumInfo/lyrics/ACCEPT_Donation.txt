It's way past noon - I just woke up
Man - I feel like shit
One drink too much - took me right out - pass
How the hell did I get home

I was still in bed when I heard the door
Somebody kept on knockin'
And there she was - neat as a pin
Smile on the face - staring down on me

There she was - there she was
Asking for the little donation
There she was - there she was
Shakin' more than my foundations

So I asked her in - and to my surprise
She didn't waste no time
She took off her dress - kicked off her shoes
And threw away her glasses

She was here - she said - to save my soul
Asking for a little donation
I gave her all I had to give
Waiting for my salvation

There she was - there she was
Praying for the little donation
On her knees - there she was
Shakin' more than my foundations

There she was
Begging for a little donation
Down on her knees 
She rocked me down to my foundations
down to my foundations

It's all for a good purpose
But it ain't for charity
It's all for a good purpose
She came for money - and gave her dignity

C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity - no charge
C.O.D.- Charity - no fees
C.O.D.- Charity

C.O.D.- Charity - she came - she saw - she conquered
C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity - she came - she saw - she had it from me
C.O.D.- Charity

C.O.D.- Charity - down
C.O.D.- Charity - down on me
C.O.D.- Charity - oh Lord
C.O.D.- Charity - she's sucking out the devil
the devil in me

You know - I'm good
Do you like my holy donation
Just call on me - whenever your want
And rock me down to my foundation

There she was
Asking for a little donation
Don't ever stop - don't spill a drop
Keep a shakin' on a my foundations
