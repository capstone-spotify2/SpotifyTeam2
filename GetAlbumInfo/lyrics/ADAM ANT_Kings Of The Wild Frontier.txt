A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
A new royal family, a wild nobility

There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming

No method in our madness (yeah)
Just pride about our maner (yeah)
Antpeople are the warriors (yeah)
Antmusic is the banner (yeah)

A new royal family, a wild nobility

And your colour schemes delight
Down below those dandy clothes

Shade too white
Shade too white

I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
