Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder, this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, hey I ought to leave the young thing alone,

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.

Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away...
