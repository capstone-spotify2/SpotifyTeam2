There is a stairway to heaven and highway to hell
Do you know where you're going? It's not hard to fucking tell
So, don't question my direction you'll understand
When we get there
What's right and what's wrong? Live your life like you don't care

There are two paths we can live by
But in the end we all fucking die
There's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Cause all my friends will be there too

When you're lost and you lose your way
I'll be right behind you
When you're down and you can't be saved
I'll get you right back on your feet
I will be the one to guide you home
When you're all alone and
When you're lost and you lose your way

When the easy way out
Seems like the only route
Asking leads doubt
What is life about?
To be silent or to shout
We go through obstacles that make choosing seem impossible
Don't forget where you end up is optional

There's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Cause all my friends will be there too

When you're lost and you lose your way
I'll be right behind you
When you're down and you can't be saved
I'll get you right back on your feet
I will be the one to guide you home
When you're all alone and
When you're lost and lose your way
