I took a risk against all odds
Had to be strong all on my own
Overcome with many ideas and fears
What should I do to carry on (carry on)?

I've got to hold on (hold on)
Be strong, yeah
Which path should I choose
Still more to walk

No matter what I'll be okay (be okay)
Cause through mistakes will carry me*
Oh decisions don't come easily for me
But now I'm free, and I'm happy

I've got to hold on (hold on)
Be strong, yeah
Which path should I choose
Still more to walk

Cause I'm free to have a voice
To use it any way I choose
Culminating past my dreams
I've made them my reality
Cause I'm free to have a voice
To use it any way I choose
Culminating past my dreams
I've made them my reality

There's no such thing as the next level
Just a continuation of movement and energy
Building bridges and climbing horizons
On a journey never ended, only to begin
Cause in the real world
Nothing is what it seems
And everything is a fantasy ready to be lived
Ready to be loved
Because in the end we are all one of the same kind

I've got to hold on (hold on)
Be strong, yeah
Which path should I choose
Still more to walk

Cause I'm free to have a voice
To use it any way I choose
Culminating past my dreams
I've made them my reality
Cause I'm free to have a voice
To use it any way I choose
Culminating past my dreams
I've made them my reality
