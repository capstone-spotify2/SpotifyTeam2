<i>[Chorus:]</i>
you wanna handcuff me
but yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
you want my intimacy
but yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
you wanna wall around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
you want my lock and my key
but yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Incarceration what I'm facin'
when I'm with you
your watchin' my every move
tryin' to pick up on some clues
we play twenty questions
everytime I walk in or out the door
what do you bother for (what do you bother for)
get comfortable its yours

Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
cracking stressing and second guessing
many time and time again
we go from lovers back to friends
got to put this to an end

<i>[Repeat Chorus 1x]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
no justification for your actions
should have been somewhere relaxing
don't compare me to your last one
I can't help it she was a fast one
a sassy one I'm a classy one
I can't keep them from getting at me hun
seems like that should make you happy hun

Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
cracking I can't deny it why I try to put up with you
these insecurities everyday
pushing my love away hay

<i>[Repeat Chorus 3x]</i>

Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Its gonna take Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Its gonna take Its gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
