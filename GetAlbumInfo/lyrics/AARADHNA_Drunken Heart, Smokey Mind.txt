Drunken heart, smokey mind
I just wanna have fun tonight
No want no lover
I just want to have a good time

You better put back your coat
I don't need to have him no more
I'm through with love
I just wanna have fun
Now roll another one

Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now

Drunken heart, smokey mind
I'm just trying to find me a glass of wine
And raise up sky high
I ain't got no time for no romance
(Maybe next lifetime)

You babe, put back your coat
I don't need to have him no more
I'm through with love
I just wanna have fun
Now let the liquor run

Let it run now, let it run down now (Liquor liquor run)
Let it run now, let it run down now (Liquor liquor run)
Let it run now, let it run down now (Liquor liquor run)
Let it run now, let it run down now

This ain't no drunken love (Oooo oooh)
It's more like drunken fun (Oooo oooh)
Ain't tryna find the one (Oooo oooh)
Just tryna bluff your blunt

This ain't no drunken love (Oooo oooh)
It's more like drunken fun (Oooo oooh)
Ain't tryna find the one (Oooo oooh)
Just tryna bluff your blunt

Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now (Roll another one)
Roll it up now, roll it up right now

Roll another one...
