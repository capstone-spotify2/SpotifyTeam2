When it comes the time that you have recognized your line
and you realize the path that you will travel through your life.
be sure that what you want is exactly what you're trying to get,
or you'll be speeding toward a cliff without realizing that...
Before you know, the haze makes you slow.
Ignore your future, forget your past.
before you know, cars start to crash.
There are so many choices, the opportunities abound.
Just be sure to keep things straight and be sure to stand your ground.
Let nothing shade your vision, even fight to keep it clear.
Let no one change what's right for you, for when you start to veer.
Before you know, the haze makes you slow.
Ignore your future, forget your past.
before you know, cars start to crash.
Before you know, the haze makes you slow.

Cars start to crash.
Before you know, the haze makes you slow.
Ignore your future, forget your past.
before you know, cars start to crash (Cars start to crash).
