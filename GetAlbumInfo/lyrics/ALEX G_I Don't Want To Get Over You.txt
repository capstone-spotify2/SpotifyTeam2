I make up my mind before it's too late
I'm sick of waiting here for you
You're my best friend and my worst heartache
So you know this is impossible to do
With every late night call
Every song you write about me

It so it so obvious that you know
What you're doing
Oh you got a hold on me
I know i know that your scared
But your honesty is deceiving
I think your honestly a mess

But I don't want to get over you
No I I don't want to get over you
No I i don't want to get over you
But I know that I have to

Now you say it's complicated
We both know that it's a lie
When it's fate you got to find a way to face it
Can't you see it's worth the fight
And it feels so wrong moving on without you

It so it so obvious that you know
What you're doing
Oh you got a hold on me
I know I know that your scared
But your honesty is deceiving
I think your honestly a mess

But I don't want to get over you
No I i don't want to get over you
No I i don't want to get over you
But I know that I have to

It so it so obvious that you know
What you're doing
Oh you got a hold on me
I know i know that you're scared
But your honesty is deceiving
I Think your honestly a mess

But I don't want to get over you
No I i don't want to get over you
No I i don't want to get over you
But I know that I have to
