I can still see you standing there next to me in the county fair ticket line
With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hand in mine
It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride

Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Baby you still drive me crazy, you still make my heart skip a beat
With those butterfly first time feelings you've always kept me on the edge of my seat
