Drivin' in my car, it's rainin' hard
I've gotta get to ya baby
Traffic's movin' slow, it's stop 'n go
And I keep dreamin' 'bout ya baby, yeah

Now when I finally get my hands on you
We'll be makin' love the whole night through
Anything you want just take from me
And I'll take you up the mountain, 'cause

It's not hard to love you at all
It's not hard to love you, baby
No, no not hard
'Cause, it's not hard to love you
It's not hard to love you baby
So easy
'Cause, it's not hard to love you at all, at all

Girl you're lookin' good I knew you would
And I love that dress you're wearin' damn
Candlelight and wine, tonight you're mine
I'm gonna show you that I'm carin'

Well all I wanna do is dance with you
Pull you close and get you in the mood
I'm gonna love you baby, all night through
Well, I'll be doin' it all for you, 'cause
It's not hard to love you at all

It's not hard to love you baby
O-o-oh it's not hard, darlin'
It's not hard to love you at all
It's not hard to love you, baby
Easy lovin' you baby
It's not hard to love you at all

Now when I finally get my hands on you
We'll be makin' love the whole night through
Anything you want just take it from me
I'm gonna give you all that I can give, 'cause

It's not hard to love you at all
It's not hard to love you, baby
Oh, no no no no no no no no no
It's not hard to love you
It's not hard to love you, baby
It's easy lovin' you
It's not hard to love you at all
It's not hard to love you, baby
