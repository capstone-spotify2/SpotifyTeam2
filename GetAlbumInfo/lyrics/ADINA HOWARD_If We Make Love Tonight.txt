<i>[Cat Daddy Ro:]</i>
Let's make it happen 
Let's make it happen, baby 
Let's make it happen 
Let's make it happen, baby 
<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If we make love tonight 
Will it change us for the rest of our lives 
(Let's make it happen) 
(Let's make it happen, baby) 
If we make love tonight 
For the very first time 
(Let's make it happen) 
(Let's make it happen, baby) 
Here we are alone again 
But we never kicked it like this before 
(We never kicked it like this before) 
Ooh, the touchin', the kissin' and the huggin', baby 
I must confess I want to explore 
We've been homies for so long 
I just can't calculate the time 
But if we make love tonight 
Will it change the way we are 
The question remains on my mind 
I wanna know 
<i>[Chorus]</i>
I call you on the phone each day 
I must admit you're my best friend 
But I can't ignore my attraction to you 
Are you the man for me 
Tell me what's in store 
You know my darkest secrets 
And I know a few things about you too 
We're puttin' our friendship on the line 
But I wanna get next to you 
All I wanna know 
<i>[Chorus]</i>
<i>[Spoken:]</i>
You know, we've been homies for awhile 
Kickin' it and everything 
I think it's time for us to take this relationship to another level 
So, uh, what I wanna know is 
Do you wanna make love to me 
Baby 
But I know 
'Cause I wanna make love to you 
Tell me if it's wrong 
Do you wanna make love to me 
Baby 
But I know 
'Cause I wanna make love to you 
But I know 
Do you wanna make love to me 
Baby 
But I know 
'Cause I wanna make love to you 
Tell me if it's wrong 

<i>[Chorus 'til fade]</i>
