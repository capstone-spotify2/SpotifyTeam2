He's been riding that rodeo
From town to town 
From show to show
He's got a restless wandering soul
His horse and saddle is his home

And she loves him
more than he knows
Yeah she loves him
enough to let him go

Let your horses all run free
Let your wings take you
As high as you can dream
She won't let you see her cry
As she's waving goodbye
She can't tame you
He's leaving that cowgirl with the blues

You can't hold that west wind long
It's got a sad low mournful song
They dream of someday making a home
But with the sunrise he'll be moving on
And she'll miss him more than he knows
Yeah she'll kiss him and tell him when he goes

And she loves him
more than he knows
Yeah she loves him
enough to let him go
