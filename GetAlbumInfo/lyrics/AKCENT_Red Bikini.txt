Yesterday when I got back home 
My girlfriend said my shirt had some lipstick on 
Started asking me where the hell I've been 
And everything became such a very bad dream. 

I'm very sorry would you please forgive me? 
Nothing really happened, baby don't you leave me

And I will promise I will never ever drink martini
And party all night long
Never gonna bring you home some red bikini 
Cause you're the one I love

Someone left in the car for me 
The smell of girl perfume and some lingerie 
She's started asking me what's that little thing, 
I said, "Baby, don't you worry cause it's not what you think."

I'm very sorry would you please forgive me? 
Nothing really happened, baby don't you leave me

And I will promise I will never ever drink martini
And party all night long
Never gonna bring you home some red bikini 
Cause you're the one I love

Don't know why you still keep on blaming me 
Don't know why you still can not trust in me 
I've been flirting, yes girl, I know it's true 
But I'm still in love, I'm in love with you. 

I apologize, would you please forgive me? 
Nothing happened, baby don't you leave me!
Once again I'm telling you I'm sorry 
Nothing really happened, baby don't you worry

And I will promise I will never ever drink martini
And party all night long
Never gonna bring you home some red bikini 
Cause you're the one I love

And I will promise you 
No party all night long
No party all night long, 
Always be early home 
Cause you're the one I love.
