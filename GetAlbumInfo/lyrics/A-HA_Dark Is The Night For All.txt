It's time we said goodbye
Time now to decide
O' don't you feel so small
Dark is the night for all

It's time we moved out West
This time will be the best
And when the evenings fall 
Dark is the night for all

It's time...yeah, to break free
It's time to pull away 
For you and for me

It's time...yeah, to break free
We need to celebrate the mystery

It's time we said goodbye
Time for you and I 
O' don't you feel so small
Dark is the night for all
