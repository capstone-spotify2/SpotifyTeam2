She said, I spent eight years in California
That's the reason why I talk the way I do
But I've heard how southern men respect the ladies
And I'd like to meet a gentleman like you.

Well, I spent most of my life in Alabama
That's the reason why I talk the way I do
And I've always had this thing for sun-tanned ladies
And I'd really like to spend some time with you.

And we walked on the beach till early morning
And we watched as the sun came up again
And somehow we both shared the feelin'
That we'd just made a very special friend.

Tomorrow I'll go back to Alabama
And you'll fly from Atlanta to L.A.
And I'll get back to takin' care of bus'ness,
And you'll go back to starrin' on the stage.

But we'll think of the beach come Monday morning
When both of us get back to push and shove
And somehow we will always remember
The night we shared a very special love.

I spent most of my life in Alabama
That's the reason why I talk the way I do
I know we shared a very special friendship
The night we made a very special love...
