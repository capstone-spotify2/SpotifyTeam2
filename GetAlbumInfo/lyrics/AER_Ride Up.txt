I hate waking up with the frost on my windshield, it belongs on my bud ha
Hate seein my breath when Iâm sitting here, know the snow will never budge
Late nights cold and flakes stuck on my shoulder, depressing but I guess Iâll stay warm
My feet on the incredible heat machine, reefer steam
The next step needs to be the song
Underground but high right now
Break your spine tryna get down
Bare light bulb 120 volts in this corner
The musics at fault the flows dried up
Lookin for inspiration for writing
But the pencil seems to have more thoughts than I do
False criminal gossip
Hydroplane across the snow and the rain to get original products
One head light out the other is flawless, I promise
I know itâs small but the work was honest

Weâll take the ride up, If youâre feeling the sound
Anyone besides us, yeah just turn that shit down
Fresh aer for your lungs

Yeah, and we just wanna have a good time
Iâm kushed up, Iâma finna shut it down
Everywhere my team go you know they come around
Good love felineâ like Iâm in my home town
Fresh Aer for the soul
Night feels young
Drinks still cold
Playinâ beer pong while these bitches get low
Party all night till the sun get old girl
And them lames gunna hate
But we livenâ it up so fuck what they say
Mind so gone Iâm just floatinâ in outer space
Drink in my hand we just rockingâ to the bass girl
And I got winners all around me
Shootout to the High Life and them good trees
Got a couple bad bitches commonâ home with me
Iâm on me G shit Aer tell um what it means

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Weâll take the ride up, If youâre feeling the sound
Anyone besides us, yeah just turn that shit down
Fresh aer for your lungs
