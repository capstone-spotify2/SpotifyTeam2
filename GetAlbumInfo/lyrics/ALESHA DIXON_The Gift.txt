The gift

Tired of searching, wanting to live for something with purpose
Trying to hold on, stanley frozen, trapped in a circus
Holding onto yesterday
The paining never lasts
If the gift is in this moment, we should let go of the past
Caught up in the future while missing out on today
Like the eyes of a child, we'll learn to see the world again

That's why this is the gift
The level I should be all seasons
Stay present in the gift of Eden
Love is when your heart believes
When you feel freedom

Going round feeling so lost out in the open
Hiding in sorrow
I tell you life is a meadow, golden and yellow
Feel the sunshine on your own
Everything we want to need is waiting in the stars
Loving is forgiven if we don't forgive our own heart
We only see the magic if we keep our soul alive
See the world again through the eyes of a child

That's why this is the gift
The level I should be all seasons
Stay present in the gift of Eden
Love is when your heart believes
When you feel freedom

Nothing's better than now
Looking over shoulders at other people
Worrying, let go of evil
Can we figure it out and have the time of our lives
As we try to touch the sky
That's where we'll see the love
The level I should be all seasons
Stay present in the gift of Eden
Love is when your heart believes
When you feel freedom

Nothing's ever really quite what it seems
Here we are, figure out what it means
Nothing's ever really quite what it seems
Here we are, figure out what it means

That's why this is the gift
The level I should be all seasons
Stay present in the gift of Eden
Love is when your heart believes
When you feel freedom
That's why this is the gift
The level I should be all seasons
Stay present in the gift of Eden
Love is when your heart believes
When you feel freedom
