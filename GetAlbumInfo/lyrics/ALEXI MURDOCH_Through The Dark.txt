Someone reaching for me now
Through the dark, reaching for me now
You need someone to hear you when you sigh
Someone to wipe away those tears you cry
Someone to hold you 'neath the darkened sky
Someone to love you more than I

I love you girl, I love you more than I can say
I love you girl, I love you more than I can say
Even with my heart in the way
