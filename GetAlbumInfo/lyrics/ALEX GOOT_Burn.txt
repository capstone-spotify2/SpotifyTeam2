We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, from outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, the human race

When the light started out they don't know what they've heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn,
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave, no, we just wanna be right now, right now
What we see is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up
It's over now, we got the love, no sleeping now, no sleeping now

When the light started out they don't know what they've heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up
So they can't put it out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out

When the light started out they don't know what they've heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn
