This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one way is wrong
The flesh is weak, but love is strong
And she's all I see between the devil and me

The gates of hell swing open wide invitin' me to step inside
I'll be your friend, he calls again, I know it's him
The flames are spreadin' everywhere
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me

I hold her in my arms tonight
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows 'cross our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know a fire burns
And she's all I see between the devil and me

The gates of hell swing open wide invitin' me to step inside
I'll be your friend, he calls again, I know it's him
The flames are spreadin' everywhere
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me

The gates of hell swing open wide
Invitin' me to step inside
She's all I see between the devil and me
