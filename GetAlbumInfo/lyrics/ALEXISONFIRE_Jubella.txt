You had such grace
(You had such grace)
In the end.
And I wish I could remember
(And I wish I could remember)
What colour
Your eyes were
(Your eyes were)
Every time, looked at you, my mind went... blank!

(Jubella)
You had the best damn Sunday dress
(You claimed to be the one)
At the end
(Who would bring down the stars)
Of the world.
(But as of yet I've seen nothing)
Of. The. World!

The walls of flames
That consumed you
And everything
That was good and...
Not with a bang, but a
Whimper.

Except
(Except)
The dead
(The dead)
Flowers
(Flower you gave)

What would you do?
Arms spread welcoming
The impending nothing.
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

You had such grace
(You had such grace)
In the end.
I wish I could remember
(In the end)
What colour your eyes were
(In the end)

But everytime...
Looked at you my... mind!
