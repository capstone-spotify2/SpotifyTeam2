Mornin' Mister Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine 
In my mind?

Mornin' Mister Shoeshine man
Shine'em bright in white and tan
Baby said she loves me and
Need I tell you that everything here is just fine
In my mind

'Scuse me if I sing 
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mister Golden Gate
I should walk but I can't wait
I can't wait to set it straight
I was shakin' but now I am makin' it fine 
Here in my mind

My heart will soar
With love that's rare and real
My smiling face will feel every cloud
Then higher still beyond the blue until
I know I can like any man reach out my hand
And touch the face of God

'Scuse me if I sing 
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mister Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine
In my mind

So won't you get up, oriole
So won't you get up, Cheerio
Wake up, Mister Radio
<i>[Scatting]</i> it's fine
Here in my mind

Singin' about mornin' little radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Wake up, Mister Radio
Need I tell you everything right is just doing fine
Woo, in my mind
