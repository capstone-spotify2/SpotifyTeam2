They terrorize and
tyrannize democracies
Their narrow minds still nothing
learned from history
The seeds of hate acquired from
their ancestry
Spreading like a cancer in societies

They've got the poison inside
Rivers of pesticide
Skin-headed minions 
they're deaf, dumb and blind
Machind-like in body - robotic in mind

Stone evil - inherited sin
Stone evil - infected from within

They can't leave it 
they can't break the spell
Under orders to obey
It was meant to last a thousand years
It took the world into dismay

Stone evil - stone evil

If you're gonna throw the torch at us
Don't expect to not get burned
It's time to stand - and fight the right
This is the lesson we have learned

They're marching to a different beat and glorify
The darkest times when innocent were crucified
They paralize and sterilize the masses' minds
They desecrate man's dignity - desensitize

They've got the poison inside
Rivers of pesticide
Skin-headed minions - they're deaf, dumb and blind
Machine-like in body - robotic in mind - evil

Stone evil - inherited sin
Stone evil - infected from within
Stone evil - inherited sin
