Well I'm standing here looking at you
What do I see? I'm looking straight through
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, that music's lost its taste
So try another flavor

Don't tread on an ant, he's done nothing to you
There might come a day when he's treading on you
Don't tread on an ant, you'll end up black and blue
You cut off his head, legs come looking for you

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor, yeah, yeah
