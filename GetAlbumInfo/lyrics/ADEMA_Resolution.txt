Know what you're thinking
It's probably what's best for me
Appreciate the sentiment
And this time, I don't want to hear it
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to hear it

There it goes again
I met a voice outside my head
Don't break those rocks and start again
Where was I?
Know what you're thinking
Probably what's best for me

Our life
In time we find
The solution
Resolution
Our life
In time we find
The solution
Resolution

Travel this road
Prone to vikraphone
They twist distractions, obstacles
Keep these rainbows
Sideways of a window
From a heart that's far from home
Staying true to this
Of course you're not coped with

Our life
In time we find
The solution
Resolution
Our life
In time we find
The solution
Resolution

Sing your heart, shout your mind
We can feel a light
Your restitution
Revolution
Never pressure under fire
Given the gift of time
We will rise
Absolution
Never leave the motherâs cry
Echoes in the night
In your prime
Your resolution

I donât want to hear it
I donât want to hear it
I donât want to hear it
Hear it anymore
I know what youâre thinking
I see it in my core
Those words youâll be eating
Rats are on the floor
While thereâs rats up in the ceiling
Iâve seen you before
The only place we're meeting
