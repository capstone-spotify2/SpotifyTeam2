I see it in your eyes
You're feeling paranoid
You know just what I've done
You know what I've become
I feel it deep inside
With all the pain &amp; lies
I know just what I want
I am an animal

I think it's time I let you go
Why did you send me off?

You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

I feel it in your bite
You are a parasite
Who knows just what I've done
I think your time has come
You try to turn the tide
I think you've lost your mind
Afraid of what I want
This sick what I've become

I think it's time I let you go
Why did you send me off?

You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage and all the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage and all the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me
