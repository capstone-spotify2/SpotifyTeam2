Sit right down and talk to me
About how you want to be
You ought to be with me
Yeah, you ought to be with me

Thinking 'bout what people do
Talking 'bout how I love you
Thinking there's nothing to what they say
You're going to be with me anyway

They don't want to see us do
All of the things we want to
You ought to be with me
Hey, you ought to be with me

You don't have to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
You can leave me now and walk away
And turn your back for another day

Let me say it:
Ought to be the kind of girl
That can brighten this old world
And it's hard to see why you and me
Can't be together happily

I'm trying to realize
You being with some other guy
I don't know the reason why
You ought to be with me until I die

(Hey, you ought to be with me until I die)

I don't want to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
I want to hold you tight, love you right
Put good feelin' in your night
