You walked a mile on broken glass
Through glowing coals you were a path

The words on your tongue a mechanical song
Your face is lined with disappointment

Oh white matter mind, what have you got to say?
Reasons combine to force you away

Youâre moving on
You solved the problem
And who canât blame you
Youâre safe in here
Inside your castle
In mythomania, mythomania

Cold crescent moon on a red cross
Its happening soon tiâs coming for us

Oh white matter mind, what is there left to say?
Reasons combined to force you away

No telephone
No television
No news that drain you
Youâre safer here
More atmosphere
In mythomania, in mythomania, mythomania

You caught belief
Like some disease
No words can save you
Cuz youâre all along
Youâre on your own
In mythomania
