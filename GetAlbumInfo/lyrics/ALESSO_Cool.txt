I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see

You said, "Itâs all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I canât do it alone, I swear."
You said, "Itâs all yours,
Itâs all yours when you smile."

Itâs only you
Who loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
Iâm trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it (about it)

Before you, love, I was lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon Iâd followed home
You were the one who rescued me

You said, "Itâs all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I canât do it alone, I swear."
You said, "Itâs all yours,
Itâs all yours when you smile."

Itâs only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
Iâm trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it (about it)

You said, "Oh, whoa.
I wonât lose you, no, whoa."

Itâs only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
Iâm trying to keep it cool
But I canât keep cool about it (about it)
