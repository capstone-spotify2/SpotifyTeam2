He made the heavens and the earth
Separated day from night
He made man and it was good
Still something wasn't right
And all creation stood in awe
At the woman standing there
Wearing nothing but a smile
And a flower in her hair

And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last

There was someone who broke my heart
Long before I fell for you
I would have swore she was the one
I thought she was my dream come true
As all the walls came crashing down
I hit my knees right there
Looking back I'm thanking God
For that unanswered prayer

And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last

How can I describe my love for you
You're my life you're my whole wide world
It's kinda like a feeling I feel holding our new born baby girl

And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
Now I know why he saved the best for last
