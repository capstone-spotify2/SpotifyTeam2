Only a fool would change himself
for a girl that lets him down, oh
only a fool would take a chance
a love that could never last

and now I sit here on my own
and dream of a girl that I used to know
I can't take her off my eyes again
'cause she's my living addiction

I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right
(Every day she's my living addiction)

oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)

Every day she's my living addiction, yeah
and if I ever get the chance
I'm gonna face it like a man, oh
I need to take my own advice
I can finally realize

and now I sit here on my own
and dream of a girl that I used to know
I can't take her off my eyes again
'cause she's my living addiction

I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right
(Every day she's my living addiction)

oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)

I was stuck in this rut so long
I've been thinking it's time to save my life
I'm convinced it's just a phase
but every day I lose my mind
if I never came back and I lost my head
would I be better off tonight
just one way to find... out

I would do it again but I don't know why
(Every day)
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right, yeah

I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right
(Every day she's my living addiction)

oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on
(Every day she's my living addiction)
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why
(Every day she's my living addiction)

Every day
Yeah
She's my living addiction
