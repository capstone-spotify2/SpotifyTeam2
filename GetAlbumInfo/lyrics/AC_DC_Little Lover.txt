Saw you in the front row
Moving to the beat
Just movin' and groovin'
Killed me when I saw
The wet patch on your seat
Was it Coca Cola?
Oh baby I hope you liked the show
When the band said goodnight
I had to say hello

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Oh baby you sure looked sweet
Cruisin'
A leg either side
Of my motorcycle seat
Just oozin'
Could have been a nightmare
Could have been a dream
But on my way home, baby
I thought I heard you scream

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind
Little Lover, oh I tried so hard to find
Someone to give me the things that I need, ah

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little Lover, oh I tried so hard to find
Someone like you

You had my picture on your bedroom wall
Next to Gary Glitter, yeah
I was standing on the stage playing rock 'n' roll
I was a guitar picker, yeah
Never had a record
Never had a hit
Ooh baby, you didn't mind a bit

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind
Little Lover, you know I tried so hard to find
Someone like you, you, you
Baby I know you're a

Little lover, ooh
