The time has come
The time for a drink
But I don't want whiskey or gin
There's only one drink
That gets me so drunk
Until my head starts to spin

Far to the west
Under tropical sun
This mystical drink is brewed
On our mission to get totally drunk
We have got nothing to lose

Rum is the power
Rum is the key
Rum is the thing that will set us free!

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum gimme more rum

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ya ha ha ha

The time has come
The time for a drink
But I don't want vodka or mead
None of these drinks will quench my thirst
Rum is the drink that I need

Questing the oceans and questing the seas
Searching for ultimate booze
On our mission to get totally drunk
We have got nothing to lose

Rum is the power
Rum is the key
Rum is the thing that will set us free!

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum gimme more rum

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum

<i>[Solo]</i>

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum gimme more rum

Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum ahoy
Rum rum rum yarr
Rum rum
