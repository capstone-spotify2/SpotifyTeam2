The door still creaks, the roof still leaks 
When the rain comes fallin' down 
The dog still barks at every car that comes around 
My boss at work, he's still a jerk 
That ain't nothing new 
I'm such a dope, my heart's still broke 
'Cause I still love you 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill 
You wrote to me don't ever change 
And I'm afraid I never will 

When day is done the night still comes 
And aaaaaai still toss and turn 
I still try to have some pride, 
While the bridge still burns 
My arms still ache, my heart still waits 
And I know there's no use 
I'm still a fool and it's so cruel 
'Cause I still love you 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill 
You wrote to me don't ever change 
And I'm afraid I never will 

The door still creaks, the roof still leaks 
But that ain't nothing new 
Thanks for the call, I guess that's all 
Except I still love you...
