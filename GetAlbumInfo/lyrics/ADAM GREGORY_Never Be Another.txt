You're the light that lights my way
On the rainy nights
You're the road that's headed home
When it's bitter outside

You're the hand that I hold
When I'm scared of the dark

There'll never ever be another you
I could search my whole life through
It's no use, all roads lead me to you
There'll never be another you

You're the first warm breath of spring
When the winter ends
You're my secret hiding place
When the world is closing in

You're the rain pouring down
When the well runs dry

There'll never ever be another you
I could search my whole life through
It's no use, all roads lead me to you
There'll never be another you

Ohh, no, never be another

You're the rain falling down
When the well runs dry

Never be another, be another you
Never be another, ohh, no

There'll never ever be another you
I could search my whole life through
It's no use, all roads lead me to you
There'll never be another you

Never be another you
Ohh, no, never be another
