Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Love bury me 

Is there a doctor in the house? 
Someone check my pulse 
Cuz it feels like I'm not breathing 
And I can't believe it 
Wherever I am there he goes 
Says he's only joking but I know 
That he really means it 
Never mind keep it 

You gotta give up to get up 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 
So give up and get out 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 

Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Love bury me 

Says I'm the one he treasures 
But you threw the key in the river 
Now how you gonna find it 
Oh go fishing is my name 
Now move out my way 
I got dishes to break 
Cuz he says he's already eaten 
Tell me where you and her are meeting 

You gotta give up to get up 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 
So give up and get out 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 

You need to think about this moment 
Before you eat around this donut 
You ain't got time for me 
I'm on to another recipe 
See you need to think about this moment 
I know that you have chosen 
To take a break from me 
Now I know that's exactly what I need 

You gotta give up to get up 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 
So give up and get out 
And leave when you're fed up 
Even though you're what I need 
I can't let love bury me 

Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Six feet under is where I'll be 
Love bury me
