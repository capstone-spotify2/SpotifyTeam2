<i>[Verse:]</i>
Drivin' my Jag, shootin' my guns
Take me to Vegas, I wanna have fun
I wanna shoot craps, I wanna play cards
Stay up late, 'til the sun come up
I wanna play with the toys I like
Not stop until I've had enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Toys (Toys)
For big boys (boys)
You'd be surprised
The joy they bring

<i>[Verse:]</i>
The open road, we take down the top
But don't look back and forget to stop
We could go fishin' and take a speed boat
Jump across waves and surf 'til we drop
I wanna play with the toys I like
Play hard until I've had enough

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Toys (Toys)
For big boys (boys)
I end up feelin' like a king

<i>[Verse:]</i>
I wanna sky dive, feel the rush
Climb a mountain straight to the top
I wanna play with the toys I like
Keep playin' until I've had enough

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Toys (Toys)
For big boys (boys)
And I end up feelin' like a king

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Toys (Toys)
For big boys (boys)
And I end up feelin' like a king
