I've been afraid that I had missed the
chance of a lifetime
And by the way
I've tumbled with romance, girl,
And I don't cry-
But now I'm

Searching every star
(I go on)
Searching near and far
(every dawn)
'Til I find our one
Spirit flying high-
Flying high,

I'll never give it up,
Never gonna give it up
Even when this life is over
Never give it up-
Never gonna give it up
Even when this life is over
Never give it up,
Never gonna give it up
Even when this life is over
I'll be content in time

I'm gonna be content in time

And so today, I think I'll take the
chance of a lifetime
And by the way,
I'm falling for romance girl,
and I don't mind
How much I cry

I'm reaching for the sun
(angels sing)
Love has just begun
(who would think)
Two could turn to one
Spirit flying high-
Flying high

Never gonna give it up...
No no no-no, not I
