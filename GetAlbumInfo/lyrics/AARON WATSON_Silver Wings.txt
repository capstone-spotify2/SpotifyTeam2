Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely,
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Don't leave me I cry, don't take that airplane ride.
But you locked me out of your mind.
Left me standing here behind.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight,
They're taking you away. Leaving me lonely.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Slowly fading out of sight.
