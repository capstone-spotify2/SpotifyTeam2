It's twilight
And the street lights, are comin on
I'm in a stream of cars, on this boulevard
Headed home
And I can hardly wait
For you to make what wrong today seem right
It's been a long hard day
So bring on the night

Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world outside
And throw the key away
And turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night

From 9 to 5
It's the same old grind, all week long
And the only thing
That keeps me sane, is comin home
When the sun goes down
You know how to set things right
Let's put the day behind us
And bring on the night

Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world outside
And throw the key away
And turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night

Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
