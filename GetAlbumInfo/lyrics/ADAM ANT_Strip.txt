It's at times like this the great heaven knows 
That we wish we had not so many clothes
So let's loosen up with a playful tease 
Like all lovers did through the centuries

We're just following ancient history 
If I strip for you will you strip for me? 
We're just following ancient history 
If I strip for you will you strip for me? 
Uh-huh-huh

When it gets so hot, the end of the day 
You may find your clothes getting in the way
If a pretty dress hides your true desire
Fold it nice and slow, throw it on the fire

We're just following ancient history 
If I strip for you will you strip for me? 
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh

We don't need to see what the butler saw
Or a mirrored room with a mirrored floor 
All those sneaky looks gazing down on you
Are no substitute for our rendezvous

We're just following ancient history 
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh

It's at times like this the great heaven knows 
That we wish we had not so many clothes 
So let's loosen up with a playful tease 
Like all lovers did through the centuries

If you think it's cheap or a bit risquÃ©
Please don't say a word I'll just slip away 
I am not a man who believes in lies 
Like an octopus with big x-ray eyes

Don't freeze up girl, you're looking quite a sight
Be generous, I want it all tonight!

We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you will you strip for me? 
We're just following ancient history 
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
