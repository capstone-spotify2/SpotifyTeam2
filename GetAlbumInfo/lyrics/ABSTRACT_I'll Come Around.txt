Haven't felt like this, in while or so
I'm about to go for broke
So I didn't know for me
And recently, to feel like this, you see
When I'm around you I ain't got air to breath
Heads in the clouds trynna get my mouth to move
Thinking what I gotta do
Just to be what's on your mind
I swear I'm a different kind of guy
And you a different kind of fine
You're the type that's hard to find
The kind I ain't just trynna spend a night with
But if you wanna You know we can do it how you like it
Late night: Alcohol
Might get text sent
Don't trip if my message is looking dyslexic

You know you a angel
Trynna hang around you like a halo
If it's cool with you just say so
Been a player I ain't trying to play games though
We can run this town
We can run this world
Only wanna know if you'll be my girl
Unstoppable, that's how it go
Just like me when I hit that floor
Know I'm all about shine and you got the glow
We can shine together
Through stormy weather
Girl, you be done good, I can do you better
On and on and I won't say forever
A scary combination of letters
But could we give it a shot?
Is you ready to rock?
If you need a little time I'll be sitting by the block

I'll come around if you ever wanna be in love
I'm not feeling
But I'm feeling it on the Earth
If you ever wanna be in love
I'll come around
You know I'll come around
Yeah, you know I'll come around

I know you got my number
I'll be here all summer
We can try this now
But we'll always wonder
What could've been
How each other feels on each others skin
Sorry I be getting intimate but if the topic's you I get in to it
Girl I'm interested if you couldn't tell
Your beautiful like no one else
I be an open book don't put me on the shelf
When I know you like you know yourself
As a Freshman can't believe you talk to me
Shy as Hell wasn't even seventeen
But that memory still sticks with me
You still the gorgeous girl Where I wanna be

You know you a angel
Trynna hang around you like a halo
If it's cool with you just say so
Been a player I ain't trynna play games though
We can run this town We can run this world
Only wanna know if you'll be my girl
Unstoppable, that's how it go
Just like me when I hit that floor
Know I'm all about that shine and you got the glow
We can shine together
Through stormy weather
Girl, you be done good, I can do you better
On and on and I won't say forever
A scary combination of letters
But could we give it a shot?
Is you ready to rock?
If you need a little time I'll be sitting by the block

I'll come around
If you ever wanna be in love
I'm not feeling
But I'm feeling it on the Earth
If you ever wanna be in love I'll come around
