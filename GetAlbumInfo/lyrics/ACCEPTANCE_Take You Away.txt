We've come a long, long way now
We're thinking we're lost
See the street signs telling me everything's fine

Take you all the way
All the way
Take you all the way
All the way

We say that we're heroes
Give it up, give it up for the kings of the night
We say that we're heroes
Give it up for the best of us tonight

We live
We love
We give it all
The best of us tonight
<i>[x2]</i>

We've come a long, long way
We're thinking we're lost
On ride to the top
Thought that we'd all be stars
And the stories we told since the days we were young

We will take you all the way
All the way
Take you all the way
All the way

We say that we're heroes
Give it up, give it up for the kings of the night
We say that we're heroes
Give it up for the best of us tonight

We live
We love
We give it all
The best of us tonight
<i>[x2]</i>

In the end we believe
Everything will be the same
In the end we believe
We will never feel this way

We say that we're heroes
Give it up, give it up for the kings of the night
We say that we're heroes
Give it up for the best of us tonight
<i>[x2]</i>

We live
We love
We give it all
The best of us tonight
<i>[x2]</i>

We live
We love
We give it all
We say that we're heroes
We live
We love
We give it all
We say that we're heroes
(We live
We love
We give it all)
(We live
We love
We give it all)
