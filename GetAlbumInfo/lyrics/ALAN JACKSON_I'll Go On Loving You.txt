When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

Then I'll go on loving you  
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
From the past

Then I'll go on loving you  
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

Then I'll go on loving you  
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
