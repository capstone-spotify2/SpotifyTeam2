My name is Alanis. I'm a white chick singer
the drums are a-smokin' and so's the bass
Shake your thing
When you sing
just sixteen
no disco queen

I'm a white chick singer I've seen the world I've got
a lession 4u I'm your teacher girl
Two words you'll be hearin' will
shake the earth so repeat after me
No need to be rehearsed

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Oh yeah

My name is Alanis I'm just sixteen so
please gimme a break I'm no disco queen
Just hear what I'm sayin' you don't
wanna miss I got a message 4U and it
goes like this

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Ride my train
Go insane
your teacher girl
rules your world

Now don't overdo it when you shake your thing
cause you'll be goin' insane when you start 
to sing
Without special training an amateur
Could be a casuality case if they sing
these words

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Yo-Ah Yo-Ah
Wo-oh Yeah!

The drums are a smokin' and so's the 
bass they keep on pumpin' a groove and it'll melt your face
Comon' everybody and blow your mind
Because you'l never escape these 2
words of mine
HA HA HA AH...
