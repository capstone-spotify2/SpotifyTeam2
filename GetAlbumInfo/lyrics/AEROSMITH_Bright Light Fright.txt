It's the dawn of the day and I'm crashed and I'm smashed
As it is I'm feelin' like my chips are cashed
All of my clothes strewn all over the room
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news

The tricks of the night keepin' me in a daze
We'll open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades
Glance in the mirror back into bed
We'll get up the same time to party again

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news

Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Go...gimme the night

Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Go...gimme the night

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news...woo

Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Go...gimme the night

Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Go...gimme the night

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news
