You're pretty like the moon
No one can get to you
That's lonely but it's true
You're pretty like the moon

Folk songs and cigarettes
You're such a perfect mess
You seem so unimpressed
You smile when you're depressed

But darlin' let me see the scars you're hiding
Underneath you're makeup
Show me what it is that you're afraid of
Why you hide behind your pretty things

And don't you know that even roses die
And nothing's really made to last forever
Even beauty fades, you can't always rely on
Pretty things

Red wine and vanity
Your fashion fantasies
That smile can't hide your tears
That boy can't hide your fears

It's better when it hurts
It shows you what it's worth
So cue the masquerade
Inside your still afraid

So darlin' show me all the the scars you're hiding
Underneath your makeup
Show me what it is that you're afraid of
Why you hide behind your pretty things

And don't you know that even roses die
And nothing's really made to last forever
Even beauty fades, you can't always rely on
Pretty things

What goes up, must come down
You fly too high, oh, you're gonna hit the ground
Too many words, they don't explain
So we hide behind our pretty things

Behind the laughter and behind the smiles
I've got my scars that I'm hiding too
Darling, how me what you're hiding
And I'll show you what I'm hiding
Behind all my pretty things
