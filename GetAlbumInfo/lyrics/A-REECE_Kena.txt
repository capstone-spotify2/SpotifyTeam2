Ever since I was a little boy
I told myself that I'm the man
My teacher said I need a real job
And that I shouldn't be a rapper
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
I'm on the stage doing dabs
Doing dabs counting cash
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo

I had to make my own decisions
Ain't nobody see the vision
I was smiling at you laughing at me nou di lass you begging me to get you tickets
Just so you can come and see me
And lie about me, say we niggas
You got my handle, now you're at me every single chance you get when you on twitter
I can turn a hater to a fan
Neh pa ti potsa, bare kramma
I was writing raps up in class they were raising hands always had the answers
Papa thought I wouldn't pass
Hit that nigga with a bachelors
Yeah I could've gotten more distinctions
But I was too busy writing all these smash hits

Ever since I was a little boy
I told myself that I'm the man
My teacher said I need a real job
And that I shouldn't be a rapper
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
I'm on the stage doing dabs
Doing dabs counting cash
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
Ake di kene ke ya ba kena
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo

Father forgive me I have been acting so different
Made some regretful decisions
The pain that's within me has put me in such a position
This wasn't even my intention
I understand that the choices you make are a lesson
So I ask you for protection
Carry me through my progression
I spent so much time on reflecting, depressed
Now I gotta go get this
I'm talking to money, the root of all evil
People around you act funny like this ain't the right thing for you to do
Or for you to having feed the family
We go out and ball a bit maybe then spoil a bitch
But bitches is snitches
I swear there's a shortage of women in this current time that we live in
You fuck her she start catching feelings
Crave your attention, fuck the whole squad tryna get it
Then you get niggas who claim to be niggas
But hate on you as soon as you ain't with them niggas
Roll with a clique that don't roll with such niggas
That hate that they love me
Hate that I'm king of the city
Pitori ain't shit without Reece
I said it, I mean it, believe it
Your daughters affect no opinion
My head through the ceiling

Ever since I was a little boy
I told myself that I'm the man
My teacher said I need a real job
And that I shouldn't be a rapper
Ake di kene keya ba kena
Ake di kene keya ba kena
I'm on the stage doing dabs
Doing dabs counting cash
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
Ake di kene keya ba kena
Ake di kene keya ba kena
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
I'm sorry you ain't get the memo
