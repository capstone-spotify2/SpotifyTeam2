In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight weâll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, âWeâre going all the way.â

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ainât friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Weâll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like itâs do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect
But we wonât know unless we try (try)
I know youâre nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight weâll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, âWeâre going all the way.â

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ainât friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Weâll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like itâs do or die
And take me to the other side

Tonight weâll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, âWeâre going all the way.â

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ainât friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Weâll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like itâs do or die
And take me to the other side

And kiss me like itâs do or die
And take me to the other side
