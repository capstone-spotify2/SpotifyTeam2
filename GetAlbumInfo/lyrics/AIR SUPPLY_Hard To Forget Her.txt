Close your eyes and fill the skies
With cotton candy clouds
Step inside the rainbow
Ride where dragonflies sing loud
Colors falling, butterflies and flowers
Paint the ground
Cuckoos calling, do I have to go
And it's hard, so hard to forget her

This is where we always said
That everything is real
Hanging from a spider's web
The valleys and the fields
Follow me inside the tree
And catch me if you can
Someone else is playing in the sand
And it's hard, so hard to forget her
