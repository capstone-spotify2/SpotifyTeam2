Tied off quick, looked around, plunge it in, pull it out. I have found a fast solution to the pain.
Painted walls, melt away, am I a ghost? Decide to stay. I am shooting my solution in the rain.
And we're all dead now!

Death will make you dream past tense, your hopes fly high and your life make sense.
(Sleep now, dream forever, sleep now, dream tonight.)

Stay up late, enjoy the view. Sing with me, die with you. Come make my dreams come true.
This high up we start to fade, watch the night turn into day. Breaking high, we hold forever-changing hearts of gold.
Injection filled with contempt, I was fine when we met. Your reflection hides protected eyes of regret.
And we're all dead now!

Death will make you dream past tense, your hopes fly high and your life make sense.
(Sleep now, dream forever, sleep now, dream tonight.)

Once again.

Sunrise before, as we wash ashore, now take us from this life, walk alone tonight. 
<i>[x2]</i>

We're all dead now! (Dead now!) 
We're all dead now! (Dead now!) 
We're all dead now! (Dead now!) 
Dead now!

Death will make you dream past tense, your hopes fly high and your life make sense.

Death will make you dream past tense, your hopes fly high and your life make sense.
(Sleep now, dream forever, sleep now, dream tonight.)

Once Again.
