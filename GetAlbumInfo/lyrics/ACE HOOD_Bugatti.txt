<i>[Intro: Future]</i>
We the motherfucking best nigga
Ace Hood
It's Over, Future

<i>[Bridge: Future]</i>
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican

TURN UP

<i>[Hook: Future]</i>

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
OK, niggas be hating I'm rich as a bitch
One hundred K I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred dollars spent that on your bitch
you and your model put that on my list
oh there he go in that Foreign again
Killing the scene bring the coroner in
murder she wrote, swallow a choke
Hit her and go, I won't call her again
woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
smoke me a pound of the loudest
whipping some shit with no mileage
diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
you pussies can't hardly afford it
Forty two hundred my mortgage
balling on niggas like Kobe
fuck all you haters you bore me
only the real get a piece of the plate
repping my city Iâm running my state
give me a pistol then run with the Kâs
Niggas want beef then I visit your place
Bang!

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
&gt; Yeah, and I'm at it again
there go the flow bringing tragedy in
copped me a chain your salary spent
niggas is sweet bring them cavities in
counting money, hourly trend
rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
niggas is squares, cabin and pens
neck full of Gold Olympian shit
niggas is blowing their checks on the gear
fall on some pussy then hop on the leer
shot with them choppers back of the rear
Sak Pase them killers is here
woke up early morning, mind is telling me money
paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga no rumor
living my life off of tuna
wanted with me I deliver the beef
real niggas only enjoying the feast
pull up a seat, bon appetite
No Louboutins put that red on your sleeves
Bang

<i>[Verse 3: Rick Ross]</i>
Photographs of dope boys
is all the take is finger prints on the Rolls Royce
is why they hating push a button on these broke boys
it's detonation, walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she living carefree
thatâs why I hustle for the half a Ki that's 12 Gâs
&gt; I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
you gotta love me I got shooters out the D-league
&gt; Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
left in a puddle finger prints is on a hundred mill
and what it is? Ricky RoseÌ and Ace Hood
we hella Trill
yeah
