Cuba, cuba here I come
There's a place in the caribbean sun
Land of future
Land of dreams
Checking for the coast

Cuban cigars
And the lass lass in the bars
I see the rise and the fall
Of this down downtown Miami
Give me someone to dance with and love
When the sun goes down
While Fidel is growing his hair

Cuba, cuba here I come
There's a place in the caribbean sun
Land of future
Land of dreams
Checking for the coast
Cuba, cuba here I come
There's a place in the caribbean sun

Cuba, cuba libre
(It's Ace of base)
Cuba, cuba libre
Uh huh

Share in the sun
Givin' us some taps
That's still the one
Where coca cola and coke
Have arrived for consumers
It's so happy and warm
It's a country down in the south
We like it
The people and nature

Cuba, cuba here I come
There's a place in the caribbean sun
Land of future
Land of dreams
Checking for the coast
