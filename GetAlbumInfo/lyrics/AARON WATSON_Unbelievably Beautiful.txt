Whenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful

And when this cruel world's been gettin' me down
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around
Like a clown, she'll crack a joke
Acting crazy as a fool
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It'd be a big old fat lie, if I said I
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone
She's so much more, so much more than meets the eye
She's an angel on loan from up above

And when I come home and the day is sinkin down
She'll set the mood and put some soft slow music on
And all 7 wonders ain't half as wonderful
Never ceases to amaze me
The epitome of what love should be
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
