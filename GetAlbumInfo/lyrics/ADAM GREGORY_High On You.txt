Mhmhm oh yeah
I don't need no mornin' coffee baby
To make my eyes open up
The buzz that I've been wakin' with lately
Cant be poured in a coffee cup

Never had a need so strong
Or one to last this long

Baby, I must be addicted
Heaven knows I cant get enough
Its crazy, I could be convicted,
They could take a key and lock me up
That's probably what they'd do, girl I'm so high on you

Oh yes I am

I'd love to drive over and see ya baby,
But I'm afraid to get behind the wheel
Just the thought of your kiss makes me dizzy,
It's not safe how you make me feel

Never had a need so strong
Or one to last this long

Baby, I must be addicted
Heaven knows I cant get enough
Its crazy, I could be convicted,
They could take a key and lock me up
That's probably what they'd do, girl I'm so high on you

It's true I'm not myself,
Look what you've done to me..

Baby, I must be addicted
Heaven knows I cant get enough
Its crazy, I
could be convicted,
They could take a key and lock me up
That's probably what they'd do, girl I'm so high on you
That's probably what they'd do,I'm so High on you.... yeah

Oh... I'm so high on you.. oh yes I am.. I'm so high on you.. mhmhm..
