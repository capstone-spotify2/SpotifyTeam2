I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

So I've come to complicate the dead. Are you with me? 
I've written out all my vows again.
we're almost home to see the silence break on new years eve.
We're only seventeen.

If love exists, I will fall.

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

Just one more kiss to soothe the pain exists,
In a world of lies. Misery take my shame alive.
When everything fails a violent death, the smile you gave.
Visit me in hell tonight, and say:
"If love exists, I will fall."

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

So I'm alive in love. (I'm alive in love.)
So I'm alive in love. (I'm alive in love.)
So I'm alive in love. (I'm alive in love.)
So I'm alive in love. (I'm alive in love.)

I feel so alive. (I feel so alive.)
I feel so alive tonight. (So alive tonight.)
I feel so alive. (So alive.)
I feel so alive, you can't stop this feeling.

So alive.
I feel so alive.
I feel so alive tonight.
I feel so alive.
I feel so alive, I feel so alive, you can't stop this feeling.

If love exists, I will fall.

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.

I will wait for this moment when our lips collide,
And almost stop the earth. You're in my arms tonight.
