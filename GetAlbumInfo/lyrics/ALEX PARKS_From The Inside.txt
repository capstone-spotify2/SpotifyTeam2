Words fall slowly,
Silent on the ground.
You don't know me at all.
So catch me quietly,
We don't need a sound.
Listening to you, as you,

Hook me up and watch me still,
Just stay with me.
You need to make me feel,
That I've got somebody.
So don't leave me.

Lie with me like you lie to me,
Show me that my heart can still touch, 
Still breath, from the inside. 
Show me, do you dare to unfold me?
You wanted it all, now I'm giving it all.
From the inside.

Can you walk through me, 
Unlock me inside?
You don't get me at all.
But please be careful, 
Don't let us collide.
I break easy, as you,

Hook me up and watch me still,
Just stay with me.
You need to make me feel,
Like I've got somebody.
So don't leave me.

Lie with me like you lie to me,
Show me that my heart can still touch, 
Still breath, from the inside. 
Show me, do you dare to unfold me?
You wanted it all, now I'm giving it all.
From the inside, from the inside.
From the inside.

Hook me up and take me, 
Somewhere we can be.
You need to make me feel,
That I am somebody.
So don't leave me.

Lie with me like you lie to me,
Show me that my heart can still touch, 
Still breath, from the inside. 
Show me, do you dare to unfold me?
You wanted it all, now I'm giving it all.
From the inside, from the inside.
