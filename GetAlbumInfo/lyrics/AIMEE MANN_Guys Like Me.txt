Guys like me
We don't know how it feels 
Absentee
Even closing the deal 
With every player there's a payoff in the final reel 
But never with guys like me 

Cause guys like me 
We look good at the gate 
But you'll agree 
With the odds on the slate 
And put your money on a bona-fide heavyweight 
And take it off guys like me 
Take off guys like me 

They'll pull you close but never really
Looking warm but feeling chilly 
You'll describe us as "impassioned" 
When it's just a front we've fashion 

Cause guys like me
We all vow to become 
Clear and free of the fife and the drum 
And block the circulation till we're all completely numb 
Let's hear it for guys like me 
Let's hear it for guys like me 
Let's hear it for guys 
Guys like me
