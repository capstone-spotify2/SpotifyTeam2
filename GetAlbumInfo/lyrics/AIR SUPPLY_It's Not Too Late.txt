I stand alone I'm just a face in the crowd
I get lonely if the truth be said
Sometimes I want to cry out loud
But I try to understand instead
I wish I had the strength inside to walk right up to you

It's not to late to fall in love
Accept your fate I'm the one you're thinking of
It's not to late so don't run away
I need you too, but it's hard for me
So hard for me to say

So I listen for the perfect moment
To rush to you, but my heart's to slow
Everybody here can see me stumble
Better wait until the lights get low
I wish I had the strength inside to walk right up to you
I wouldn't have to hide behind those doubts I know are true

It's not to late to fall in love
Accept your fate I'm the only one your thinking of
It's not too late so don't run away
I need you to

But it's hard for me
Yes it's hard for me
Yes it's hard for me
So hard for me to say

It's not to late to fall in love
Accept your fate I'm the one you're thinking of
It's not to late so don't run away
I need you too, but it's hard for me
So hard for me to say
