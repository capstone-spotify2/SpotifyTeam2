I look outside and I realize
The day is beautiful
If not for the sun I believe I would die

Somewhere between now and the future
Is where my life begins
Iâll keep on moving like thereâs a fragment of hope

Oh, Iâll save my breath
I wonât complain
About the day to day
And no, I wonât stand up
When people say
âYouâll never make itâ
(Youâll never make it)

The sun is right for me to be dreaming of
A life in the limelight
A life where I play my songs

Somewhere between now and the future
Is where my life begins
Iâll keep on moving like thereâs a fragment of hope

Oh, Iâll save my breath
I wonât complain
About the day to day
And no, I wonât stand up
When people say
âYouâll never make itâ
(Youâll never make it)

Oh is there a chance I can do with my life everything they told me I could?
And if I hold on now, will I be understood?
Yeah

Oh, Iâll save my breath
I wonât complain
About the day to day
And no, I stand my ground
When people say
âYouâll never make itâ
(Youâll never make it)
