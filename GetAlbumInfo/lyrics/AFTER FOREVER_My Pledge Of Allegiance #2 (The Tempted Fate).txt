My decision is fixed
The suitcases are packed
I'm laying the letter on the table

Tonight, I will be safe and the fears will be over
I shall outline my own way again!

I'm walking to the door
Open it and look behind for the last time...

Tonight, I will be safe and the fears will be over
I shall outline my own way again!

But he's at the doorstep - this can't be real
He's surprised because he notices, notices my bags
Immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
I realise, I realise I'm lost...

Oh no, what have you done?
What have you done?
Where is your self respect?
You've defiled our honour and your throth
You crossed the line

You won't get out this time
You won't get out
There's no other solution
Then requite you for this insult

But he's at the doorstep - this can't be real
He's surprised because he notices my bags
Immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
While he's reading the letter I realise I'm lost...

Faded beauty, her body trembles...
The scars of this dream will always be remembered
