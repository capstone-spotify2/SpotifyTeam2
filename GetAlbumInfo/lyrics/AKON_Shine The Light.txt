Shine the light on me,
Shine the light, shine the light on me
Shine the light on me,
And let me shine if you love me

She don't want to go nowhere
Unless going with me
She don't want to see nobody
'Cause she my woman
In the way that she breathing
With the strongest love
She reminds me she loves me
When she told me it's over
I said I don't care about the other girls
I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
I don't care about the other girls
I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you

Shine the light on me...

Baby girl, baby girl
You know I want to learn how to love
'Cause I will need you for sure
'Cause I ain't got nobody but you
Yeah, and everything you ever wanted,
I provide it for you, yeah
And everything that you want to
Make sure it happens for you
Just know,
I don't care about the other girls
I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
I don't care about the other girls
I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you
She said I just want to be with you

Shine the light on me...

She don't wanna go through all
She don't wanna go through me, no
She don't wanna hurt no more
She don't wanna hurt no more
She don't wanna hurt no more

Shine the light, shine the light...
Shine the light on me...
I just want you to shine the light on me...
Shine the light if you love me...
