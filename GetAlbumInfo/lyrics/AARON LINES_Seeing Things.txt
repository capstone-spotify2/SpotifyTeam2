That night, that dress
Baby, I must confess
I was tongue-tied, but inside
My mind got way ahead of me
I'm stuck in this confusion
Trapped in some illusion
It's all because of you
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things

Sunlight on you face
Waking up with you each day
My shirt on you
Just the thought's driving me crazy
It's like I'm in a daze
Some kind of lovesick haze
Before I go insane

Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things

I'm drunk on love, I'm stoned on you
I'm wasted, your face is
Everywhere I turn

Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things
