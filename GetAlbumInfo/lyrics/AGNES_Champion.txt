Mmmmm...

You say it's impossible 
But you didn't even try at all 
Why am I the only one 
Who gives the most all the time 

You never can admit the truth 
Trying to laugh it off 
You say I'm a silly girl 
But you just don't understand 

Did you think I could ever be 
The same way that I used to be 
Letting you have your way 
Though you had the best of me 

The tables are turning now 
I'm the one that's in control 
No more lonely broken hearts 
Can't you see I'm moving on 

'Cause I-I-I-I'm a champion 
So much stronger than I was before 
'Cause I-I-I-I'm a champion 
Finally taking hold of my life 

It's easier to let you go 
Now I'm not emotional 
I've learned to make it on my own 
I can carry on by myself 

I'm through with all the pain 
No more drowning in the rain 
I'm free to be who I am 
This time I am moving on 

'Cause I-I-I-I'm a champion 
So much stronger than I was before 
'Cause I-I-I-I'm a champion 
Finally taking hold of my life  

On my life 
Oh, oh, on my life, oohh 

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Every sign, every move 
I will seek without you 
Everytime every move 
It will be what I choose 
Every sign every move 
I will seek without you 
Everytime every move 
It will be what I choose 

<i>[Chorus (2x) impro/variation]</i>
