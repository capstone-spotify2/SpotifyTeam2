The Steam is a burning
Workin' up and down the line
The pot is getting ready
He's been working it so hard
When it comes to lovin'
Big jack is on his way
Wink of satisfaction
His time is going on

I'm like a bad defender
Smoking holy joe
He's a big pretender

Look out for jack
He's on his way
Big Jack
Big Jack
You know it's only natural
He gets you up to scratch
Big Jack
Big Jack
You've got a reputation
You really got the knack
Big Jack
Big Jack
He said that he's the only one
Who got a full sack
Big Jack
Look out Jack
He's always at your back

You never leave a dollar
Racking up the balls
You like to get it on fast
Back there standing tall
When he hears the siren
He's gonna put you on the racks
He got a bad reputation
Climbing all over the bars

Gonna press the flesh
Rockin' rollin' soldier
He's the last of them all

Well tell Jack
He's on his way
Big Jack
Big Jack
You know it's only natural
To get you up to scratch
Big Jack
Big Jack
Always into trouble
Got to turn the other way
Big Jack
Big Jack
Always like to party
And he likes the girls to play
Big Jack
Look out Jack
He's always at your back

Big Jack
Big Jack
You know it's only natural
To get you up to scratch
Big Jack
Big Jack
You've got a reputation
Really got the knack
Big Jack
Big Jack
He said he ain't the only one
That got a full sack
Big Jack
Look out Jack
Ain't no need to worry
He's always at your back
