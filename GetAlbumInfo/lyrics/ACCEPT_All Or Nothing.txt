Revolution in the streets
Our vision turned into reality
Too late to stop it now
A spark that's lit a fire burning high

It's time to take a stand
Stand up for your rights and your beliefs
Together we'll strang - we're gonna fight them all
We got the power - to turn the world around

It's all or nothing - and we don't stop fighting
All or nothing - and we won't back down
It's all or nothing - we can light a fire
All or nothing - we will take it all

No matter what you are
No matter where you're from and where you go
There's a place for all of you
Side by side - we can only win

No turning back the time
The force is growing day by day
No wall is high enough - no chain too strong
We got the power - to double back around

It's all or nothing - and we don't stop fighting
All or nothing - and we won't back down
It's all or nothing - we can strike a fire
All or nothing - we will take it all - we will take it all

It's all or nothing - let us break the silence
All or nothing - we will shout it out
It's all or nothing - so we'll strike a fire
All or nothing

It's all or nothing - and we don't stop dreaming
All or nothing - and we won't back down
It's all or nothing - and we won't stop believing
All or nothing - we will take it all - we will have it all
