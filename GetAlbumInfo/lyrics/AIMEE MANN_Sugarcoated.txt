You looked the part of
The poor brave martyr
And guess who broke your heart
Whoever has it

Sugarcoated
When they wrote it
I would've believed it too
I would've believed it too
I would believe it

I'm so relentless
And you're defenseless
Until the pencil stops
You'll be the one who's

Sugarcoated
Overloaded
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe it

And out of your mouth
Comes a stream of cliches
Now I have given you so much rope
You should have been hanging for days
But you keep spinning it out
Spinning it out
Spinning it out
Spinning it out
Spinning it out
Spinning it out

It wasn't nice though
I came back twice so
Now I'm the antichrist
If I had been as

Sugarcoated
Self-promoted
They would've believed me too
They would've believed me too
Would you believe me too
Would you believe it too
