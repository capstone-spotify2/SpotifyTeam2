run so many miles
i run
i left the others in the dust
i know exactly what i want
iâll catch up
because

ooh i want you now
want you now now now
feels like iâm off the ground
off the ground ground ground
âtil i find you iâm never coming down down down
until youâre mine iâll be dreaming of you
even with so much to lose
being without you just wonât do
and since this world is so confused
you should know that

iâll be chasing you
heading straight to you
âtil iâm facing you
iâll be chasing you
ooh i want you now
want you now now now
ooh i want you now
want you now now now

time
iâm always racing time
cause i forget that you and i
are written in the stars
and i canât rest âtil iâm where you are

ooh i want you now
want you now now now
feels like iâm off the ground
off the ground ground ground
âtil i find you iâm never coming down down down
until youâre mine iâll be dreaming of you

even with so much to lose
being without you just wonât do
and since this world is so confused
you should know that

iâll be chasing you
heading straight to you
âtil iâm facing you
iâll be chasing you
ooh i want you now
want you now now now
ooh i want you now
want you now now now

i left my doubts in the shadows
threw caution to the wind yeah
finding you somewhere somehow was never a question no
cause while iâm restless searching for you
i know youâre restless searching for me too

iâll be chasing you
heading straight to you
âtil iâm facing you
iâll be chasing you
ooh i want you now
want you now now now
ooh i want you now
want you now now now

run so many miles
i run
i left the others in the dust
i know exactly what i want
iâll catch up
