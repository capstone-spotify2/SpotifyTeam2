Bright lights, I can't really see right
Cold eyes to hide what it feels like
They take from me what I need from you
Fast steps, to find my way back to
Your love, we're due for a comeback
I get from them what I give to you

Please take me back to a dream
Where miles away a place is never seen
Show me the wonders above
'Cause I don't need your favour, just your love

Please take me back to
Please take me back to
Please take me back to where my heart was on fire
Back to
Just take me back to
Just take me back to where my heart was, was, was

Wake up, I don't really feel right
Can't seem, to hide what it feels like

This time, it's hard to hold onto
Your love, with all of these flashbacks

Please take me back to a dream
Where miles away a place is never seen
Show me the wonders above
'Cause I don't need your favour, just your love

Please take me back to
Please take me back to
Please take me back to where my heart was on fire
Back to
Just take me back to
Just take me back to where my heart was, was, was
