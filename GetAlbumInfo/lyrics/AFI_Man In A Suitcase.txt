I know something I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell, I know something i won't tell.

I'd invite you back to my place
I know its mine because it holds my suitcase
It looks home to me all right
But it's a hundred miles from yesterday night

Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me, the man with the stranger's face
Must I be the man in a suitcase

Another key for my collection
For security I race for my connection
Bird in a flying cage you'll never get to know me well
The world's my oyster, a hotel room's a prison cell

Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me, the man with the stranger's face
Must I be the man in a suitcase

I'd invite you back to my place
I know its mine because it holds my suitcase
It looks like home to me all right
But it's a hundred miles from yesterday night

Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me, the man with the stranger's face
Must I be the man in a suitcase

Is it me, the man with the stranger's face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me, the man with the stranger's face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me, the man in a suitcase
