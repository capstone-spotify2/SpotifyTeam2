Baby you're a work of art
A shooting star
Lighting up the darkness
So lucky that we found this, yeah
You know you've got me losing sleep
I can't believe the beauty of this moment
It's all I've ever wanted
But I can't love you

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
I can't love you today
I can't love you tomorrow
I can't love you anyway
I can't love you anyhow
I can't love you, love you

I love the way you touch my lips
You live to kiss
The freckles on my shoulder
So I can pull you closer, yeah
Some people search all their lives for what we've got
A fairytale in motion
With hearts deep as the ocean
But I can't love you

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

Wrote a chapter full of us
Just to burn it up
I can't love you, love you <i>[x2]</i>
Tied to bed with bright green eyes
Just to come undone
But I can't love you

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
