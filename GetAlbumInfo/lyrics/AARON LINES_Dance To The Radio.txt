Your daddy wouldn't like it if he knew what
I was thinking right now
But the way you look this evening girl it's hard to keep
Your feet on the ground
It's raining outside
Let's start a fire
Baby I say we just stay in tonight
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us

And it takes me back to that summer night when you and me
Learned everything about love
I just wanna hold
Your body close girl I don't wanna ever let go

ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us

I wanna feel your heart beat all night long
When you whisper in my ear, girl it's sweeter than
My favorite song

ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around baby
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
Let's dance to the radio
