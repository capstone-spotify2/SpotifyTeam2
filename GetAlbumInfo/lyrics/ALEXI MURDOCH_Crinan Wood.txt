It was cold, you had your hands inside your sleeves 
As we walked I heard the laughter in the leaves 
See the shadows lying now where once we stood 
And I would lie down right there if only I could 

The music came to me, it came across the sound 
And you laughed and shown and danced a circle around 
As we walked away, I saw a shadow on the ground 
There were stones inside my pockets that I found 

When I was younger I heard angels on the roof 
As thousand voices singing, each one was the truth 
Well a wise young lad, I left them in my youth 
And I have only just my memory for proof 

See a doorway open on a darker road 

Out in the garden, thread lies broken on the loom 
See a face that's smiling, quick around the wall 
And in the distance, mountains waiting for the fall 

See these knots around my hands, around my feet 
They would take me down my end for me to meet 
I grow weary of this struggle and this fight 
The morning's so far off from out here in the night 

The night is cold and you must leave me, this I know 
And empty all the places where we used to go 
Before I knew you I went climbing in the snow 
Called your name out to the darkness down below
