Wanna be
you just a wanna be
know thats a wanna be 
over here tryna be a thug and shit

Im so tierd
of all these nigga tryna play like they thugs
i really cant sow them so love 
i learn how to spot them from a mile away
and let me tell you how

Staying at home with your momma dont count
borrowing a car to go out it dont count
yea you got money in your pocket no doubt 
but i found out you've been fakin the amount

So how...
How you get to the club?
Did you come on dubs?
and when you got inside did they show you some love? (no)
Up in V.I.P was you poppin the bub

You aint come on dubs (yea i did)
And they aint show you no love (yea they did)
I seen you at the bar you aint poppin no bub (what?)
Sippin on that henni like a wanna be thug

(Cuz yous a)
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
(Cuz yous a)
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
(Cuz yous a)
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
(Cuz yous a)
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be,
(Cuz yous a)
wan-na-be, wa-nna-be

There really aint a need 
and no askin ya
cuz when you pulled up to the club 
you was a passenger
actin like a champ
when you a challenger
and all the shit
that you been poppin
it just aint adding up (no no)
i think you missed your call and
you really shouldent be around these players 
while they ballin
while your tryna to come up
u steady fallin
you need to find somethin else to put your all in 
cuz it wont be me
