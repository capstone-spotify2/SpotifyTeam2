I wore out my welcome as the days grew thin
In this Belfast town
It's like I've been waitin' 'til my life begins
And love comes around

I wander through the streets and I see them look away
The wind hits my bones as they whisper your name
I go out walking in the cold Irish rain

Fed up with the landlord comin' down my door
With his poison gaze
I've stared out his window and I've walked the floor
Of this sorry place

I'll take comfort in the cold until I find my faith again
Oh God know I've tried but I just can't fit in
I go out walking in the cold Irish rain

What I'd give to see the sun on your face
To lose myself, in a long embrace
How I'd love to hear the band start to play
As you turn me around, Oh I long for the day

The last of the ramblin' boys has lost his way
In these broken times
They sold off your story and they stole your rage
With this heart of mine

They pulled you from your sleep and they covered up your name
Now on Sundays they pray to see you again
I go out walking in the cold Irish rain

I go out walking in the cold Irish rain
I go out walking in the cold Irish rain...

In the rain, in the rain.
