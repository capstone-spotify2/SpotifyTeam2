I'm wise and ambitious, 
And angry and free, 
And smart and available, 
And sexy... 
I'm soft and appealing, 
And wearing pajamas, 
And twisted and willing, 
And crazy... 

And this is the story of the death of Cinderella 
She'd grow to be a maid if she couldn't find a fella 
Who can use her 
And it's all you could do not to throw her on the floor. 

And thought-provoking, 
And opinionated 
Cultured and funny, 
And experienced... 
Fearless and tender, 
And sweetly innocent, 
Uninhibited, 
Likes a good debate. 

And this is the story of the death of Cinderella 
She'd grow to be a maid if she couldn't find a fella 
Who can use her 
And it's all you could do not to tie her to the bed. 

I could fall in love a million times before I die 
You could draw me a bubble bath, 
We could walk into the sunset... 

And this is the story of the death of Cinderella 
She'd grow to be a maid if she couldn't find a fella 
Who can use her 
And it's all you could do not to shake her sober. 

And this is the story of the death of Cinderella 
I'm gonna grow to be a maid cause I'll never find a fella 
Who can use me 
And it's all you can do not to kick me in the ass.
