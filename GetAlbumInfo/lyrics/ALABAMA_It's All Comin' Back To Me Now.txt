I must have been the luckiest man in the world
I'll never know why I left her
There's nothin' like the love of a small town girl
But I thought I'd found something better.

So I hit the big cities from coast to coast
And I must admit I had a good time
But now I've been around, and I'd like to settle down
But only with the one that I left behind

And it's all comin' back to me now
It's all comin' back to me now
It's all comin' back to me now.

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

You know I never was much for keepin' in touch
I never wrote and never heard from her
I'd love to talk to her, maybe try to make up
For some of the pain I caused her.

I realize now, I'm down on my luck
And she's what I could never find
And now I'm back in town, but she's not around
And I'm dealin' with a heartache of the very worst kind.

And it's all comin' back to me now, right now
It's all comin' back to me now.

I wonder now if this is how she must have hurt
I know, for what I did, I'm gettin' what I deserve
'Cause it's all comin' back to me now.

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Now I'm back in town, but she's not around
And I'm dealin' with a heartache of the very worst kind.

And it's all comin' back to me now, right now
It's all (it's all) comin' back (comin' back) to me now.

<i>[Instrumental &amp; vocalizations]</i>

It's all (comin' back, comin' back to me now)
(comin' back, comin' back to me now)
(comin' back, comin' back to me now...)

<i>[Instrumental to fade out]</i>
