Once upon a midnight, the metal flag was raised
Long ago a sabbath black cut through the purple haze
Upon a silver mountain a message loud and clear
Screaming with a vengeance that we will forever hear

They're the pride of our ages
In their anthems we trust
Like denim and leather
And diamonds and rust

Here's to...the rocking warriors
Here's to...our heroes and friends
And those who've gone before us
We're loyal straight 'til the end

They're The Last of a Dying Breed
And we salute you
The Last of a Dying Breed

The zeppelin led it's voyage thru skies of purple deep
The guillotine come crashing down and heads rolled in the streets
And in a land down under highway to hell was paved
An iron fist cut the deck and drew the ace of spades

They're the pride of our ages
In their anthems we trust
It's metal to metal
And dust to dust
