Let me just say for the sake of conversation
If there's such a thing as reincarnation
Don't you go crying for me when I'm gone
Cause I'm gonna come back as a country song

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'll be playing all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song.

And I'd have to say it'd be Heaven to me
Watching neon lights for eternity!
So go ahead and put it on my headstone
Yeah, I'm gonna come back as a country song

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'll be playing all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song.

So here I am on a stool tonight
Yeah, I'm practicing up for the afterlife
Cause when I'm nothing but a pile of bones
I'm gonna come back as a country song.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'll be playing all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song.
