Time means nothing here.
We let the past, the future disappear
Inside this moment.
We live and breathe as one,
Nothing can't become something,
Something can't become nothing,
We are...

Rainbow skies, northern lights,
Tails from falling satellites,
Like fireworks you're breaking through
The love I feel, you feel it too.
Forget the world, let's stay inside
I know the perfect place to hide.
Only me and you...
In this bubble made for two.

Caught in a blind spot,
We only got eyes for each other.
Some kind of madness I know.
But it's the way I feel.
Nothing can't become something,
Something can't become nothing,
We are...

Rainbow skies, northern lights,
Tails from falling satellites,
Like fireworks you're breaking through
The love I feel, you feel it too.
Forget the world, let's stay inside
I know the perfect place to hide.
Only me and you...
In this bubble made for two.

The tears inside your eyes
Multiply, become a river in me

Rainbow skies, northern lights,
Tails from falling satellites,
Like fireworks you're breaking through
The love I feel, you feel it too.
Forget the world, let's stay inside
I know the perfect place to hide.
Only me and you...
In this bubble made for two.

In this bubble made for two.
