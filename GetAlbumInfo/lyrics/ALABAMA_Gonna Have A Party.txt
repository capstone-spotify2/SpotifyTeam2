Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree
Gonna have a party, come on along with me
Gonna have a good time, everybody's feelin' right
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.

Well, Thought I'd call you early, make sure that you know
There's gonna be a party and I'd love for you to go
I just wanna give you'all time to get your story right
There's gonna be a party and it might last all night.

Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree
Gonna have a party, come on along with me
Gonna have a good time, everybody feelin' right
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.

There's gonna be some music and you can sing along
I bet before the night is through they'll play our favorite song
When they play that slow dance and I'm holdin' you so tight
That's when the party's startin', baby, and it might last all night.

Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree

Gonna have a good time, everybody feelin' right
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.
