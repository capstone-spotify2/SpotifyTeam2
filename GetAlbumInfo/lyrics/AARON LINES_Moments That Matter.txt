I used to think I was a bigshot
Thought I had it all but guess what
Can't measure life by the things you got
In the end it all ends up to nothing

I swear I missed so many birthdays
Valentines, hallowe'ens and anniversaries
Left me lonesome in the worst ways
But mister I learned something

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
There's a big pot of gold at the top of the ladder
But you can't buy back the moments that matter

Gonna play some football in the backyard
Teach my nephew how to play the guitar
Call up some old friends and play some cards
Waste a few Saturday evenings

Gonna take my wife out dancing
Every now and then without her asking
Spin her around singing and laughing
There's memories we should be making

<i>[Chorus]</i>

All this talk about the good life
Makes me realize I got a great life
Gotta keep my priorities in sight
You just get one time around

<i>[Chorus]</i>

You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
Years pass you buy and the days start to scatter
But you can't buy back the moments that matter
