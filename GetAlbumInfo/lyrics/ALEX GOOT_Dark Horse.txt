I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
You better choose carefully
âCause I, Iâm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me you my Aphrodite
Make me you my one and only
But donât make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Girl, you should know what youâre falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause Iâm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youâre mine, once youâre mine
Yeah, thereâs no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, donât walk away

Itâs in the palm of your hand now baby
Itâs a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
It all to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic
Girl, you should know what youâre falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause Iâm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youâre mine, once youâre mine
Yeah, thereâs no going back

Thereâs no going back
