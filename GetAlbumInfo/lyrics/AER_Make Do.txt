I know that Iâve done this before
Canât promise i wonât do it again
And from the other side of the phone
Sounds like you really just donât care
So Iâll be there in twenty minutes for you
Skip the shift, forget your employer
Granted wish you better enjoy it
You need me for explorin
Yeah youâve stepped foot in here and now you canât tell
What happens in the walls of the Beverly hotel
In the morning its vacant, go separate ways and no hearts breaking
You compelled, i hear ya coming first not hearing wedding bells
What happens on the floor of the mark hotel
In the morning its vacant, go separate ways and no hearts breaking

You know Iâm willing and able
In the summer time when itâs me and you
Itâs always been on when Iâm capable
Thatâs just how we make do
Letâs get high and chill <i>[x4]</i>

What I see in you, I donât normally see, so let me get to know you
Getting tired of the same old place with your same old man looking over your shoulder
My track record ainât clean, but forget that and believe, it canât wait til were older
There's no distance that could come in between, so lemme grab a hold of ya
I understand you donât know me well, but Iâm so glad you left your house, 
saint laurent saturate the lapels, stoned gaze got me under your spell, 
Iâve never come across this before, jaw dropped we should talk on the floor, I
 got a lot of love but you should show me some more, Imma give my love behind your closed door

Cause Iâm just home for now
If you happen to be round
We could watch the night sky <i>[x2]</i>
