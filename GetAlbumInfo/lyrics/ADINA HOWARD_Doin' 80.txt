This is a true story (this is a true story)
Its kinda crazy (its kinda crazy)
It goes back a little (It goes back a little)
See me and my mans (see, me and my mans)
We was like peanut butta and jelly (we was like, peanut butta n jelly)
It was crazy like (like)
One wasn't without the other (one wasn't without the other)
It was something (it was something)
And it took a wrong turn
I ended up on the freeway

Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 on the freeway and im on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 I im doin 80
Im doin 80 I im doin 80

I got this feeling that I just cant shake
And I cant focus I cant even concentrate
Where my baby been all day long
Last time we spoke said he was on his way home
I tried to tell myself don't lose it don't jump to no conclusions
But what could he be doing
Im headed for the door, grab my car keys
Now Im on the freeway doin 80

Im hoping that Im wrong aint nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on wont you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 on the freeway and im on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 I im doin 80
Im doin 80 I im doin 80

As I get closer I start to question what im doing
I must be wrong could I be wrong am I just foolish
He gotta know I aint the type of girl to fool with
And god I hope I don't run up and see some bullshit
I tried to tell myself don't lose it just turn up the music
But what could he be doing oh
Damn he got me dippin
Don't wanna get a ticket
But I gotta know

Im hoping that Im wrong aint nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on wont you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 on the freeway and im on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
Im doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I aint slowin down till I know whats goin down
Im doin 80 I im doin 80
Im doin 80 I im doin 80

I know he's home
His lights is on
Whos car is in the driveway
He aint alone
I walked up on the porch
Knock knock knock (Who is it)
He wont open the door
Knock knock knock
Baby girl I know its you
But I cant open up this door
Cause if I do you'll know the truth and wont love me no more
Baby say no more open up the door
He opened the door
It was my best friend
