Let's fight

We're face to face
Loyalty is what I need to see from you
You're insecure
I can see the fear that breeds in your heart
Where will you run? <i>[x2]</i>
Where will you hide? <i>[x2]</i>
I see the blood drip from your eyes
Who will survive? Let's get it on
And we'll fight

I know who you are
The leader of lost souls
You can't kill me
I'm immortal
I'm not afraid to die
My soul will travel on
You can't kill me
I'm immortal
Immortal
Immortal
Immortal

I need the rush
There's nowhere you could hide before you die
Why won't you face me?
I can see the fear that's in your eyes
Where will you run? <i>[x2]</i>
Where will you hide? <i>[x2]</i>
I see the blood drip from your eyes
Who will survive? Let's get it on
And we'll fight

I know who you are
The leader of lost souls
You can't kill me
I'm immortal
I'm not afraid to die
My soul will travel on
You can't kill me
I'm immortal

I know who you are
The leader of lost souls
You can't kill me
I'm immortal
I'm not afraid to die
My soul will travel on
You can't kill me
I'm immortal

Where will you run? <i>[x2]</i>
Where will you hide? <i>[x2]</i>
Let's fight
