I saw you
I think you saw me too
You smiled at me
Like strangers do
Then you...
Disappeared in the crowd
Are you that somebody?

Even if I don't have you
I'm not leaving this club without you
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me
I will treat you so good
Leave you shaking
I'll leave you breathless
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me

Stay with me
Stay until dawn
One body
And a rush of blood
And your hands...
How I need your hands
Are you that somebody?

Even if I don't have you
I'm not leaving this club without you
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me
I will treat you so good
Leave you shaking
I'll leave you breathless
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me

I'm gonna lay you down...
I'm gonna set you free...
I'm gonna make you part of me...

Even if I don't have you
I'm not leaving this club without you
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me
I will treat you so good
Leave you shaking
I'll leave you breathless
And I'll do anything to get you
To walk out of here with me
