Rip down up and down
The night kept coming in
There was nothing I could do
To stop your suffering
Well it hardly does you fair
Headlines made from potty chairs
So rip down up and down
The night kept coming in
Last chance buddy, your last chance
No re-runs just this performance
I was wounded, she was beautiful.
Rip down up and down
The night just hung around
A chipmunk full of Beatlenuts
And a holy roller sound
Just mop-mop and that's it
Nearly made us quit
So rip down up and down
The night kept coming in
Rip down up and down
The night just wouldn't go
On the unsolved crimes list he is
He frisbeed his halo
For my memory
Or a dart from a ubangi
Rip down up and down
The night kept coming in.
