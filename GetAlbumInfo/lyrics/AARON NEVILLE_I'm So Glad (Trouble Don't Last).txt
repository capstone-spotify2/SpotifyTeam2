Well you know, I'm so glad
I know that trouble don't last always
Oh My Lord, I wonder, what shall I do
You better run, run on sinner run
You better find you a hiding place
Oh my Lord, Oh my Lord I wonder what shall I do
I'm so glad, I'm so glad Lord
You know that trouble don't last always
I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I know that trouble don't last always
Oh my Lord, I wonder, what shall I do
Well, I'm getting worried, what can I do
I'm getting tired Lordâ¨What can I do
I'm getting worried
What can I do
You promised me Jesus
You'd be beside me
You promised me Lord, you'd bring me out of trouble
You promised me Lord
You'd be my friend now
You promised me Lord, you'd stay right here beside me
I'm so glad, so glad Lord, I got Religion Lord in time
I'm so glad Lord that I got religion in time
I'm so glad, so glad Lord, I got Religion Lord in time
Oh my Lord, Oh my Lord I wonder what shall I do
Soon one morning, you know when that dawn kept creeping in my room

O, soon one morning, I know that I'll be tried
Soon one morning, you know when that dawn kept creeping in my room
Oh my Lord, I wonder, what shall I do
