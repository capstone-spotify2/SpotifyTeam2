Can I have a kiss?
Can I have a touch?
It's too much baby
I don't wanna hold you back

Your smiling face
Your lips on mine
Your love divine
Oh, its too much baby

Listen, I wanna say
That its too much
Too much for me
Come on now

Oh baby, too much baby
Too much for me
I gotta say, ooh

Your smilin' face
Your lips on mine
Talkin about a love divine
It's too much, oh

Everyday feel like Sunday
And your smile is something I can't fathom
It's just too much, I love you too much, just
I can't keep holdin' you back, it's

Your love is way too much
Baby, I said it's too much
Girl, it's too much, oh hey

I was one step closer
To your arms from mine
I feel your love so divine
It, it, it ,it, it, it, it, its
Just, just, just, just, just, too, too much
Too much for me

I, I want to take you in my arms
Just one more time I'm askin'
Give me your love
I don't need no hug

It's too much
Too much for me
Oh, that loves just
It is too much

Oh now, it's too much for me
Baby, it's too much
