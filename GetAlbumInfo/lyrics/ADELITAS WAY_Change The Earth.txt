You act like I'm crazy
Cause my dreams are bigger than all of your doubts
Cause no one else could ever feel like I
And all you do is compromise my moves, oh well
I see the sun still shining bright
Oh lord, here it goes

I think I could change the earth
Say I can, I know I can, easy
I think I could show the world
Say I can, I know I can, easy
But it's not up to you, you
It's not up to you

Is it cause you made me?
Then my dreams keep falling through my hands like sand
Cause no one else will ever feel like I
When all of you just tell me what to do
And when I see my soul return I ride
Oh lord, here we go

You...

I think I could change the earth
Say I can, I know I can, easy
I think I could change the earth
Say I can, I know I can, easy
I think I could show the world
Say I can, I know I can, easy
But it's not up to you

Say I can, I know I can, easy
