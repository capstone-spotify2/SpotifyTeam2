In a cold and dark December
As I walked into the rain
Stood beside the road
All night long

In the grey December morning
I decided to leave my home
Took a train to nowhere
Far away - far away

Many thousand miles away
When the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days 
Days gone by - days gone by

In the night, the seawinds are calling
And the city is far far away
Soon the sea turns to darkness
It is night and the seawinds are calling
Seawinds call, seawinds call

Then thousand miles away
When the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days
Days gone by

I've been told so many stories
Of dreams my friends have made
So there's no illusions
Sail away - sail away

In the night, the seawinds are calling
And the city is far far away
Soon the sea turns to darkness
It is night and the seawinds are calling
Seawinds call, seawinds call
