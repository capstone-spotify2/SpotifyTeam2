Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
Do me a favor
Stop making me cry
Cause I feel I ain't strong no more

I need you to stop right now
Cause it feels like I'm sinking down
With my pockets full of stones
And a brick tied around my soul

Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same

Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
You know I used to be a fighter
But ever since you came into my life
I can't find what's wrong from right

Oh you took the hope out of me
I can't find any joy in anything
And all of the things that I used to enjoy
I don't enjoy them no more

Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same

Everybody's wondering
Where she go
The girl that they used to know
She don't live here no more

She's gone
She's gone
She's gone

Uuh uuh I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
