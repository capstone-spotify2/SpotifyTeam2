Let's get the party started
And lady do your tricks
Let's get the joint jumping
The boys need their kicks

We're gonna shock the nation
Make them flip their lids
You know you need a vacation
Oh, bring along a bottle and enjoy the trip

I said ride ride ride, up all night
Ride, it'll blow your mind
Baptism by the fire
The rock and rolling tires
Baptism by the fire
You spark a burning wire
Play your hand, come on and make a stand

You hear a clap of thunder
Or feel her lightning spike,hey
You get your pistons firing
It's lady fortunes night

Ride ride ride, up all night
Ride, it'll blow your mind
Baptism by the fire
The rock and rolling tires
Baptism by the fire
You feel the burning the wire
Baptism by the fire
Shooting higher, shooting higher, yeah yeah yeah
Play your hand, come on and play your hand
And let me show you how, yeah
Come on and make a stand

It'll blow yo mind
Baptism by the fire
Sweet sweet desire
Baptism by the fire
You're got the burning the wire
Baptism by the fire
Shooting higher shooting higher, yeah yeah yeah
