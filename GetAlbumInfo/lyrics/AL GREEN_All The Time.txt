Sometimes when I cry, I cry for you, baby
Sometimes well, I know, I'm over you, baby
Sometimes when I try so hard to bear
Well, I'll do my very best all the time
Do my very best all the time

Sometimes when I smile, hey, hey, I smile for you, baby
Sometimes when I'm down, I'm down for you, baby
Sometimes when I cry, so hard to bear
Well, I'll do my very best, try to save the rest all the time, oh yeah
Do my very best all the time

Oh, I know, I know I'll do my very best all the time, yeah
I'll do my very best all the time
Oh, I'll do my very best, do my very best
Do my very best, all the time

Do my very best
Do my very best
Do my very best all the time
Do my very best
Do my very best

Come on, come on, yeah
Come on, come on, now, now, now
Oh, yeah

I'll do my very best, every time
Every time, every time I
Do my very best
Try to save the rest
Do my very best
All the time

Do my very best
Try to save the rest
Do my very best
All the time
