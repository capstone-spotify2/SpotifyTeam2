Okay I stepped off in this mothafucka
Bankroll on me! (On me!)
Feelin' myself, got a couple chains on me (Woo!)
See I Think I'm the shit, you should think the same
I'm swagging with them all bet them bitches know my name
Cause I walk it like I talk
Depends how I said it? Them other niggas stompin'!
I'm out here gettin' fed
Cause I walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it
Not long before I cop it, now it's off the market

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Ok now, more money more problems, just bring me my dollars
See I'm 'bout my fetti, paper chasing scholar
Got them diamonds on my wrist, more off from my collar
Swag is on the good, talking chubaka I pull up in that coolata
Hoppin out with the models
Hand them with the marbles, they might have some type of choppers
I just tell you how to play, watch what you be sayin
Walk it like I talk it bitch I'm focus on the bandz
I pull up to any club, you already know
There go mister hood, just don't check him at the door
Got that bumper label on, oh I think I'm fly
Bitch you know I is, that's exactly my reply

<i>[Hook:]</i>
K.R. stepped off in this motherfucker
Bankroll on me! (On me!)
Feelin' myself, got a couple chains on me (Woo!)
See I think I'm the shit (The shit!), and you should think the same
I'm swaggin' with them all, bet those bitches know my name!
Cause I walk it like I talk
Depends how I say it, them other niggas startin'!
I'm out here gettin' fed
Cause I walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it
Wanna bet I cop it; no longer on the market

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Ok, I'm too raw for you bitches
Living what you wishing
Keeko gonna keep that pistol, swear one day it meet your stitches
You should see me when I'm loking, sipping on my lil
Potion
Have them bitches bugging, yeah I'm talking roaches
Cause I walk it like I talk it, copy it if I like it
Gonna bet I get her wet
Check that pussy like some nices
Bet I'm getting head
Swaggin off in the jag
With the top peeling back
Just to make them mad, just another paper tag
I'm so down for the talking, that's just if you mention cash
What you say? What you say?
Ok, we ain't talking about paper
You kindly kiss my ass
