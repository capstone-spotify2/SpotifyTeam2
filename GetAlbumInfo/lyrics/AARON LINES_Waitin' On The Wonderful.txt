It's way too easy to live this life
With your eyes half-closed, don't I know
I spend half my time bored out of my mind
Sleep walking
Well I wake up to this fool's parade
And I watch the leaves fall down
I see everything changing
But somehow I feel caged in
Just hangin' around

I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Something to set me free
Out of the ordinary
Come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful

It's that feelin' that's so hard to explain
When the world's so big and you're so small
An you get caught up with the wonder of it all
That's what I'm missing

I saw that look today in a young kid's face
Eating ice cream in a laundromat
And if you asked him it was Christmas again
I wanna get that back

I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
A taste of something sweet
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful

Yeah Yeah
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Wooohooohoo
I know it's out there

I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
To come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
