I'm fading like the taillights
Of a car that you pass 
In the middle of the night
Man it's lonely out here 
There just ain't enough gasoline
To put the distance I need between 
The hurt inside
Wasn't it good 
Wasn't it right 
Wasn't it worth sticking around for
Putting up a fight? 
You could have fooled me
Ain't it my luck I could have sworn that what we
Felt inside was love 
Your touch it was warm 
Your kiss it was sweet 
It felt exactly the way
Love's supposed to be 
You could have fooled me 
She'll be getting up about now 
Have her coffee then it's off for town 
Will she think about me?
After work when she gets home 
She'll finish that book lying there by the phone
Is she hoping I'll call? 
Wasn't it real 
Wasn't it amazing 
Didn't she feel the same 
Or am I just crazy? 
You could have fooled me 
Ain't it my luck I could have sworn that what we
Felt inside was love 
Your touch it was warm
Your kiss it was sweet 
It felt exactly the way 
Love's supposed to be
You could have fooled me
When I held you close
When we said we'd never let go 
Wasn't it good 
Wasn't it right 
Wasn't it worth sticking around for 
Putting up a fight? 
You could have fooled me 
Ain't it my luck I could have sworn that what we
Felt inside was love 
Your touch it was warm 
Your kiss it was sweet 
It felt exactly the way
Love's supposed to be 
You could have fooled me 
Ain't it my luck I could have sworn that what we
Felt inside was love 
Your touch it was warm 
Your kiss it was sweet
It felt exactly the way 
Love's supposed to be 
You could have fooled me 
You could have fooled me 
You could have fooled me
You could have fooled me
