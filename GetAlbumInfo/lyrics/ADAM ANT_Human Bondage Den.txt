Hey ho strike
Hey ho strike

O lucky lucky lucky me
I can live here in luxury
Can't answer your simplicity (oh no)
You've got to stop your grumbling
And all that human bondage den
And try to make a man of me

Hey ho strike one
Last one in's a son of a gun

Hey ho strike two
Can't fight here, this is the war room

Oh never never let me go
The flaming flesh that wonder hole
Where violence equals zero (oh no)
You've got to stop your grumbling
And all that human bondage den
Beef cake and custard to a big hero

Hey ho strike one
Last one in's a son of a gun

Hey ho strike two
Can't fight here, this is the war room

Can't fight here, this is the war room

So kiss me quickly who'll oblige?
Oh come along and don't be shy
Don't be all surface no insides (oh no)
You've got to stop your grumbling
And all that human bondage den
So swear the heat in baby
No neck ties

Hey ho strike one
Last one in's a son of a gun

Hey ho strike two
Can't fight here, this is the war room

Hey ho strike three
Action stations I'm ready

Hey ho strike four
My durango supercar

Hey ho strike five
Wake up now its time to die

Hey ho strike six
Flopnik kaputnik

Hey ho strike seven
Kissing at five, necking at eleven

Hey ho strike eight
Decided to co-operate

Hey ho strike nine
Gonna have us a crackin'good time

Hey ho strike ten
Flowers, bullets, zen and zen
