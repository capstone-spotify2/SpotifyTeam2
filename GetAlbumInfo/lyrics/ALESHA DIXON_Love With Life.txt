Temperaly I get by
Hoping if the cloud in my mind
Then I pray, I wanna fall from the stars
Be the lord of the dance
And now I'm dreaming of a world that could be
Land of heaven is a place within me
So I choose to love
Even though it gets hard
My heart's in a kingdom, still covered in scars
I'm living for today
I'm happy I can say

That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing <i>[?]</i>
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life

Usually the story goes
The more I lose, the more I'm able to grow
I know that every little move that I make
Will be <i>[?]</i> a mistake
In the corner of my mind, a past is put aside
I'm feeling good, 'cos I'm loving the sunshine
Living for today
And now I'm happy I can say

That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing <i>[?]</i>
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life

Say it louder
'Cos I'm sick of all the crowd of noise
Only room for a high choice
I make 'em proud of me
Finally I get to really see
What I've been fighting for in
I believe
Shine on me
'Cos finally
This is why I'm so in love

That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing <i>[?]</i>
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life

I'm so in love
So in love with life
So in love
So in love with life
