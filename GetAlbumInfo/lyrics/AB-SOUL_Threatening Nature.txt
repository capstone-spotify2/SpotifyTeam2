Look
It go 1, 2, 3 (turn it up)
The Devil's after me (little louder)
4, 5, 6
She's always throwing sticks (yeah)
7, 8, 9
She misses every time (little louder)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I'm more than a man
(Ey ey, yo man, g-g-get your hand out of my pocket)

This time around
We taking atheists to church
Serving serpents with sermons with curse words
You can do all things through Jesus Christ
All the time God is good
And God is good all the time
24/7 all day
Every week
Numerous funeral services
For PaKK music beats
(Do What Thou Wilt)
The front line is behind me
And I have no fear
My heart pump the same blood as Jehovah's son
Or Joseph if you wanna go there
Hail Mary
Coming up with lies
To tell fairies out of nowhere
Can't help my selfish desires
My life is 'bout the vices, nigga (yeah, so)
It could all be so simple
But its complicated
I go around the whole nation
Saying stop the violence
But its ten times hard enough alone
Fighting temptation face facts
Still wicked as Aleister Crowley
You niggas know me
No, you niggas don't know me
I take that back
Noticed the dead man that's chalked out
On the bottom of the brim
Of my deadline snapback
I used to shop at Lids
But I'm still over niggas heads
Like ceilings and bright ideas
I'm just an awkward Carson kid
With chandelier up in my shit
My soul on fire got this threatening nature from Ras Kass
An atom is a molecule
Adam was a maricon
But if he would've never ate that apple
He'd be mad sad
And would've never pulled the leaves off of Eve
And seen all that ass
Like a true mack
True dat, true dat, sit tight
Listen, listen, hear, and understand
Or just give me some insight
You get on your knees every night to pray to a man
That you barely understand or have even seen with your eyes closed
Then turn around and do the same thing
Get on your knees then put a ring on the woman that you wanna call your wife
Something ain't right yo

(Soul, let these motherfuckers know)
Way back when I was in grade school I learned about history
But what about her story, did anybody ask?
With all disrespect
I think the American flag was designed by fags
I had it locked before the spotlight
I got a gold key and Benjamin Franklin's kite
Nigga I'm bright
This HiiiPower shit is limitless
You tryna fuck a model
And I'm trying to deflower Queen Elizabeth
Just to be precise, who knew that Genesis really meant
The genealogy of ISIS, this shit ridiculous
The chicken came before the egg is my hypothesis and
This ain't a album, this an algorithm, yeah
We went from picking cotton for men in wigs and stockings
To liberation and renaissances
What is this nonsense?
And we don't speak on sexism much as we really should
The black man could vote before the woman could
You singing hymns in church, I'm looking for the hers
In 66 books in the bible, they ain't let a lady say one word
Hilary Clinton is out somewhere trying to get ahead in the Senate
I'm getting head and I'm sinning
Nigga I'm threatening nature
