it's been over ten thousand minutes since you said goodbye
and i've thought about that moment at least a million times
you were standing at the kitchen counter, with a single tear in your eye
the day you changed my life

well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you

well, i can't smell the roses and the rainbows are just shades of grey
and all those things that made me happy just don't move me the same
i can't help but remember us laughing, the way i held you every night
you made my whole world come alive

well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you

well, i was minding my own business, down at our favourite bookstore
contemplating my own existence, when you walked through that door
you asked how i was doing, so i did my best to lie
but i wanted so bad to tell you, what i really felt inside

(i'm going through the motions)
well, i'm just taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you

well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
