I was singing at the ol' Broken Spoke 
I could have swore she came walking in
Forgot the words to a song that I wrote

Must be losing my mind once again
Her daddy is a southern Baptist preacher
I had to choose her or the bars where I sang 
Now when I call I can't seem to reach her
I'm gonna find her if it's the last thing

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So I'll drive all night long
Till I find where we went wrong
But there's no love in sight -
Just those lonely Lubbock lights

I was ready to give up the road
As I turned onto her street
But the silhouette there in her window
Was of someone who once looked like me
I'd placed a price on her heart
But someone else collected the bounty
Now this lost soul don't know where to start
I think I'm lost somewhere in Hale County

<i>[Chorus]</i>

That west Texas wind grew colder
As I left her further behind me 
Sometimes I stop and cry on the shoulder
Cause every town I pass helps to remind me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
