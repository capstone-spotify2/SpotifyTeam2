I see you sleeping on the job, man
It ain't even a surprise, man
I won't even talk about it
I saw it coming and now I'm pulling out man
Pusha span'a ke le one fede
Be le ba seletse ka morao man
Jazzy Jeff'ing on these funny rappers
We throwing them out of the house, man
I hustle hard for the young Mula, Carter 5 ain't even out yeah
Talk is cheap and you talk a lot, put your money where your mouth is
Hold up hold ema nyane, Pitori I know that you're proud man
Hold up hold ema nyane, Pitori nigga I'm a god man

Oh my, oh my, oh my god

You're looking for me hope you're looking up
'Cause I'm forever at the top
Say a prayer hater please

When I'm in Pitori and shit if I said it I mean it
Believe it or not it's okay
The youngin is winning, the dream is coming to fruition and getting bigger by the day
Man admit it I'm showing niggas flames
Fire emoji's on all of their faces
Fire emoji's on all of my lyrics
Fire emoji's on just my appearance, I'm feeling myself
I'm feeling myself like I forgot where I put my wallet
(Oh okay I got it)
I've been about it, it's about time I make this about me (fede)
Hold up hold ema nyane, Pitori I know that you're proud man
Hold up hold ema nyane, Pitori nigga I'm a god man

Oh my, oh my, oh my god
