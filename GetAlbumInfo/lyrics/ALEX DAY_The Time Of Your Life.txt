I want you to know
the things that I do.
I know you were right,
I know what you think.
I miss our times,
the plans that we made,
I don't want things
to end this way.

So here we are,
together tonight,
I hope you're having the time of your life.
Let's start again,
one step at a time,
we could have something and I want to try
if you want to try.

Time's on our side,
you've got what you want,
I'll understand
if you want me to stop.
I know I was wrong
but I'm learning fast.
Is there a way
to put this in the past?

So here we are,
together tonight,
I hope you're having the time of your life.
Let's start again,
one step at a time,
we could have something and I want to try
if you want to try.

I'm sorry I told you I loved you,
I meant it at the time.
I should have payed more attention,
I knew I couldn't hide.
I wanted to tell you the truth but
I couldn't say it right.
I should have payed more attention,
I knew I couldn't hide.
I knew I couldn't hide and now I know
(Now I know, now I know)
I don't want to push you away.
I know
(Now I know, now I know)
I don't want to push you away.
This is something I want to say:

So here we are,
together tonight,
I hope you're having the time of your life.
Let's start again,
one step at a time,
we could have something and I want to try
if you want to try.
