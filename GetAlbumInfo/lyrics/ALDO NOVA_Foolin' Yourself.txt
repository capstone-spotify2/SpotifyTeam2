So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, but you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself

I saw you walk down the street with somebody new
It's funny people I meet they talk about me and you, yea
But who's to blame for our bein' apart
Is it me or is it you?
And who's to say that you're still in my heart
'Cause now really the best I can do, is say

So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself
So just go fooling yourself

It's funny I couldn't see, the change you went through
All those new friends that you'd meet and the places they took you to, yea
And all you could say, you would say, "They're just friends"
And you laughed in my face 'cause you knew
And I'd never know where you'd been late at night
So now really the best I can do, is say

So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself
Oh, yea

So now you walk down the street with somebody new, huh
It's funny, people I meet, they don't talk about me and you no more
But who's to blame for our bein' apart
Is it me or is it you?
And who would've said, that you were in my heart?
'Cause now really the best I can do is say

So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself

So go on fooling yourself
Your fooling yourself
Your fooling yourself
Your fooling yourself
Your fooling yourself
