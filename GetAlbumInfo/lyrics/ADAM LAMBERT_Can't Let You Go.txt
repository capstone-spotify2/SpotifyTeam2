Oh.... yeah

Guess it was not meant to be
But it's not as bad as it seems
It only burns when I breathe, yeah

You saw the way that I fell
But I'm better off by myself
That's the tale I like to tell, yeah

But it's not that easy for me to say goodbye
And everything in me, wants you back in my life

Can't let you go
Can't let you go, oh

It feels like the dawn of the dead
Like bombs goin' off in my head
Never a moment of rest, yeah

Nothing kills more than to know 
That this is the end of the road
And I know I gotta let go, oh

But it's not that easy for me to say goodbye
And everything in me, wants you back in my life

Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go, oh

Wish I could just find a way
To have all your memories erased
Cause constantly they're haunting me

But it's not that easy for me to say goodbye!
And everything in me, wants you back in my life!

Can't let you go!
Can't let you go!
Can't let you go!
Can't let you go! Oh

I can't let you go, oh
I can't let you go, oh
