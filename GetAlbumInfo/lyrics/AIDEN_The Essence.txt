"So when I say religion poisons everything,
I mean to say it infects us in our most basic integrity.
It says we can't be moral without Big Brother, without a totalitarian permission.
It means we can't be good to one another.
We must be afraid, we must also be forced to love someone who we fear, the essence of sadomasochism"
