They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror

They're in the business of illusion

An empire built on pain
The Almighty's inquisition
They're a fire burning out of controll

A thousand years of praying
Of faith, morality
A thousand years of staying
Of terror in the name of cross

Will you pray - will you cry
Thou shalt not bear false witness
When brothers in faith
Turn to brothers in arms
Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven images
How many more have to die

They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror

You pay for your salvation
You have to bend your knees in pain
No surrender to temptation
You're a slave to the eye of the Lord

Will you pray - will you cry
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain
When brothers in faith
Turn to brothers in arms
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's oxen
How many more have to die

They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror
they are protectors
They are protectors of terror

Fear not those who dare to treed
upon the ashes of the chosen ones
They will drink the spillage of the blood
Behind closed doors the darkest
one prepares his altar of death

They are protectors
will you pray - will you cry
Of terror
when brothers in faith turn
to brothers in arms
They are protectors
hom many more have to die

Laws carved in stone are rewritten in blood

They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror
They are protectors of terror
they are protectors
They are protectors of terror

They are protectors of terror
