I can recall those warm summer days.
No decisions. Child's play.
Did they slip away?
Gone forever. Gone forever.
Lost to yesterday.

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend.
True until the end of time.

As I walk down streets
full of amber leaves
I see nothing's really
changed at all.
We're just older now.
Still together,still together
after all these years.

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend.
True until the end of time.

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time.
