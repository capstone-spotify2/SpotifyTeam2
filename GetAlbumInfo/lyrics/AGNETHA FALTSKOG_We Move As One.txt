We stand apart,
But everything reminds me of your smile
In my heart,
You are always with me all the while,
Cause it's you, you all the way
Leaving me with no more to say
We move as one,
We move as one.

I'm insecure,
I just can't face the dealings of this world
And while I'm yours,
You'll never have to find another girl,
We are two changing forever
But when two make it together
We move as one,
We move as one.

We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one.

Hear me call,
I'll keep on running to your loving arms
If this is all,
I want no more, everything is calm,
'Cause it's you, you all the way
Leaving me with no more to say
We move as one,
We move as one.

We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one.

We move as one, move as one
We move as one,
We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one.

We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one, move as one
We move as one.
