I want to start a revolution
A type of personal solution
We all have got our own pollution
It's all about the execution

You got something to say
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth, open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor, just let it drop
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot?
Feel the fire within

I wanna see you strut (strut, strut)
C'mon walk for me
Strut (strut, strut)
How you wanna be

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo

We're a complicated nation
And now we're in a situation
Let's take a make-believe vacation
And get yourself some validation

You got something to say
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth, open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor, just let it drive
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot?
Feel the fire within

I wanna see you strut (strut, strut)
C'mon walk for me
Strut (strut, strut)
How you wanna be

Everybody's lookin' for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo

I'll be your mirror
Darling, let your hair down
Show me what you're working with and let me see you
Strut (strut, strut), strut (strut, strut)
How you wanna be

Everybody's lookin' for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo (solo, solo)
Don't wanna be solo

Strut for me and show me what you're working with
Strut for me and show me what you're working with
