<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i>
We the best def jam
I introduce you to Ace
Ace let's get money

<i>[T-Pain &amp; Rick Ross:]</i>
Cash flow... (haha)
It's too easy nigga (bankroll)
We don't count money no mo
We weight that shit

<i>[Adlibs: Rick Ross]</i>
Let's get it...

<i>[Verse: Ace Hood]</i>
Ay knock knock, bang bang
Where the cash at
If u ain't got it leave you bloody like a tampax
Come up swinging at you thugs aflac
Then I fall in the sway black maybach
See I'm back for da money like I left dat
See I be runnin on the route where da cash go (where da cash go)
And any nigga interfering with the cash flow
So he can get pumped on like Citgo
Make his body bounce bounce like a 6 4
Tall clips chrome lips see the big gold
I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke
Big crack threw tha music so the flow dope
I keep my money ova bitches til da door close
I need money like a bitch need dick mo
I'm tryna c it like a muhfuckin castro
Rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll

<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i>
One thing about me I don't play about mine
I be bangin on your front door with da nine
I'm a come see ya (see ya)
I'm a come see ya (see ya)
I need all my dough not a dolla short
And if u don't have it den u gotta go
I'm a come see ya(see ya)
(hey hey) We put our hands In da sky let em know dat we bout that
Cash flow... I need it on time I'mTalkin bank roll
(my money my money my money)
Cash flow... I need it on time
I'm talkin bank roll
(my money my money my money...)

<i>[Verse: Ace Hood]</i>
And where my money young niggaz gotta have that
Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the louie band napsack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Moneyman minivan full of brown bags
Better grand any man never top that
Cause money and the gat pop those straps
Getting loot in the top drop right back
I ain't playin creep ya avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a new year day blast
And I ride all day like a bus pass
Grindin hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors wave 4's where da cash go (where da cash go)
I'm trying to see it like a mutha fuckin castro
Rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll

<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i>
One thing about me I don't play about mine
I be bangin on your front door with da nine
I'm a come see ya (see ya)
I'm a come see ya (see ya)
I need all my dough not a dolla short
And if u don't have it den u gotta go
I'm a come see ya(see ya... hey hey)
We put our hands In da sky let em kno dat we bout that
Cash flow... I need it on time I'm
Talkin bank roll (my money my money my money)
Cash flow... I need it
On time I'm talkin bank roll (my money my money my money...)

<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i>
One thing about me I don't play about mine
