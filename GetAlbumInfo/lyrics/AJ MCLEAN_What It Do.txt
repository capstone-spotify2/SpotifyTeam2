Girl you got it going on, your lips your legs your beautiful eyes
You've got attitude, I'll tell you straight it's something I like
I won't deny that I can't live without you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's me and you baby,
What it do
Know that you're not alone
Don't do it on your own
It's so true baby
What it do
It's time to realize won't let you fantasize
Am I getting through
What it do

Smoking, drinking, sex no thinking that today I might get it right
If I had to choose, I'll give it up 'cause that's what it do
I'm getting high, now I'm addicted to you, oh yeah

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's me and you baby,
What it do
Know that you're not alone
Don't do it on your own
It's so true baby
What it do
It's time to realize won't let you fantasize
Am I getting through
What it do

You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it (What it do)
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it (What it do)
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it

I'm getting high, now I'm addicted to you, oh yeah

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's me and you baby,
What it do
Know that you're not alone
Don't do it on your own
It's so true baby
What it do
It's time to realize won't let you fantasize
Am I getting through
What it do

What it do
What it do

You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it (What it do)
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it (What it do)
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it (What it do)
You want it, you got it, you want it, you got it, you got it, you want it

(What it do)
(What it do)
