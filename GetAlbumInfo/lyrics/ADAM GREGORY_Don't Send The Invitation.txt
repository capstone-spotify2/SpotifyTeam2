Give me a cold one, I'm gonna drink it
Bait my hook, I'm gonna sink it
You double dare me, I'll always take it
Ask me to dance, I'll sure enough shake it
If you think I'm bluffin', well hmm not hardly
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

A bit of a wink, that first skirt
Even momma says, Dont hurt to flurt
But the signals, your sending me
Can't be taken mistakenly
Well, if you don't wanna ride
Don't kick start my Harley
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

All night long
and you'd be comin', on really strong
Girl you know we can't go wrong
Once we get the thing started
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

Clock on the wall, she's half past one
Bar man says, no more fun
I've got some skinner, out in my truck
You look willin', to crack things up
If your just teasin', back off by golly
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

All night long
and you'd be comin', on really strong
Girl you know we can't go wrong
Once we get the thing started
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

If you can't stand the heat
Don't order hot tamales
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party
Don't send the invitation if you don't wanna party

Don't send that invitation
Don't send that invitation to me
Oh yeah
