Baby let your hair fall down around me
Let me feel your body close right next to me
There's something about the way you look into my eyes
That let's me know that you wear no disguise

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love

Baby you broke the chains around this heart
You made this jaded man put down his guard
And I don't know all the words to say how I feel inside
Baby let me show you tonight

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love

Baby hold on tight, don't ever let go
I wanna feel you in my arms and my soul

Baby, baby, baby

The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love
