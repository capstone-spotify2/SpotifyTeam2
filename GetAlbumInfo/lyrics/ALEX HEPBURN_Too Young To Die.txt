I miss your face where you go
It ain't the same I'm on my own
Wish we could stay on the telephone
Or send me a message
In a bottle

Say it's gonna be alright
Baby don't cry for me no more
I got a whole lot life
I'm too young to die
For somebody else's war
Gotta fight
Baby you don't have to understand
Coming home to you
I'll be there soon
Baby baby
Gonna hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand yeah

These restless nights feel hollow
Your picture goes where I go
As winter's by it feels so cold
Just send me a message
In a bottle

Say it's gonna be alright
Baby don't cry for me no more
I got a whole lot life
I'm too young to die
For somebody else's war
Gotta fight
Baby you don't have to understand
Coming home to you
I'll be there soon
Baby baby
Gonna hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand yeah

Say goodnight but please don't say goodbye
Not going anywhere anywhere but by your side
Baby please come home

Say it's gonna be alright
Baby don't cry for me no more
I got a whole lot life
I'm too young to die
For somebody else's war
Gotta fight
Baby you don't have to understand
Coming home to you
I'll be there soon
Baby baby
Gonna hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand
Hold your hand yeah

Gonna hold your hand
Hold your hand
Gonna hold your hand baby
Gonna hold your hand
