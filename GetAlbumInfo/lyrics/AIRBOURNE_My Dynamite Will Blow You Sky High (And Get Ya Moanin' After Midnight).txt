I'm gonna stick it in 
Ight to the top 
I'm gonna make it hop 
And never make it hot 
And never cool off 
Cause my love you can't deny 
It's as true as a lie 
You're the perfect combination 
To blow my mind 

When you pull the trigger 
Baby, pull my trigger 

My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 

I'm a human sponge 
For your love 
And once you squeeze 
Baby I can't get enough 
Cause it's runnin' down your legs 
I'm here to clean it up 
I won't stop till I taste the dregs 
On the edge of my tongue 

When you pull the trigger 
Baby, pull my trigger 

My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
Get it in to ya 

My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight 
My dynamite will blow you sky high 
And get ya moanin' after midnight
