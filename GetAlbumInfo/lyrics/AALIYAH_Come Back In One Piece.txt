There we go, okay, okay
Don't do me Greasy, okay
Uh, ay yo
You know what a dog needs
Do you really know what a dog needs?
Uh a dog needs a grrr!
What? What? A dog needs a grrr!
Come on
Not just any uh but a real uh
That's gonna hold that dog down
Arf! Arf!

Baby I am what I am, I'm gon' be who I be
Everything from chasing a cat to p***** on a tree
Let me see what I gotta to see
Do what I gotta to do
Dog for life but keep it true
Every once in a while I'll break out the backyard to roam
And get reckless
But I still know that home is home
And when I get there I'mma sit there
Take a s*** there put my d*** there
Do I handle my business?
S*** yeah
I'mma run till I bust my gun and empty the clip
Never come home, I gotta go just gimme the whip
I ain't got time for the lip
Just open the fence
Let me go I'll come back
I ain't got time to convince
Ever since I was a pup
I've been stuck with the street s***
Keep the heat s***
F*** it n**** gotta eat
I past on a weak s***
If it's out there I want it
All at one time
So when it's my time I've done it

<i>[Aaliyah]</i>
I know you'll kill for me
You'll die you me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Ooh baby I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat
I barely sleep
Could you pick up a phone and call me at home?
And let me know you ain't in some heat
And don't go crying, you're grown
You know I'm looking out for you
Cause you be looking out for me, me, me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Yo you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
'Fore you go betting it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece

<i>[Aaliyah (DMX)]</i>
And oh boy I know you got to do what you do, ooh-ooh
You're making moves, I'm makin' moves yo we cool
(What? What? What?)
Lay on your paws I got your back if you fall, hey-hey
Nothing's to big, nothing's to small just go ball, yeah

<i>[DMX]</i>
Uh dog tags around my neck the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind
Cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why n***** sleep till nine
Out by ten back by ten
Sleep till nine do it again
If you love something let it go
If it comes back to you it yours
If it doesn't f*** it you'll never know
You got me I got you, uh
Dog with a dog, ride till we die
If it's on then it's on

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Yo you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
'Fore you go betting it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
