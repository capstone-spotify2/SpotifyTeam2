It's a one stop light red light don't diss it
Don't blink if you do you might miss it
It don't look like much I know but
This place has heart and soul
It's where love was born and love ones are buried
A little church where we got married
Living life like a black and white movie
After all this time you still move me
Years and years of tears and smiles
Good memories go for miles

Yeah I love this town
No there ain't a road we ain't been down
Yeah I'm still here and you're still here beside me riding around 
Girl just like an old love song
Playing on and on and on and on
We'll keep on going strong
Tune out the world when it goes wrong
Don't you know that everybody dreams about what we found
A big love in a small town

It's a mom and pop corner shop five and dimer
My grandaddy bought my new old timer
A six pack and a pack of smokes
Peanut patties and cherry cokes
They roll up those sidewalks at night
But that's alright

Yeah I love this town
No there ain't a road we ain't been down
Yeah I'm still here and you're still here beside me riding around 
Girl just like an old love song
Playing on and on and on and on
We'll keep on going strong
Tune out the world when it goes wrong
Don't you know that everybody dreams about what we found
A big love in a small town

Raising crops and raising kids
Like our folks and their parents did
Some say we're behind the times
Like that's a bad thing
But baby that's a good thing

Yeah I love this town
No there ain't a road we ain't been down
Yeah I'm still here and you're still here beside me riding around 
Girl just like an old love song
Playing on and on and on and on
We'll keep on going strong
Tune out the world when it goes wrong
Don't you know that everybody dreams about what we found
Don't you know that everybody dreams about what we found
A big love in a small town
A big love in a small town
A big love in a small town

We got a big love, big love
We got a big love, big love
A big love in a small town
