Wasted, wasted love
You had so much to give
For giving me time
Darling, had enough
And now I understand
So put your hands in mine
Baby I will take you far away
Donât you know these are our golden days
Baby all the other boys they donât see what I see
Now wonât you say you see it in me
Tamarinds and skinny jeans
Oh wonât you be my summer love
Take you walking through the garden
And take my heart when summer comes
Take me to your special place
The one by the river in summer
Iâll keep you safe
And donât be afraid of the love that you have
I wonât let you down like the other boys have
I found you mmm
Darling I found you ohh
Baby I will take you far away
Donât you know these are our golden days
Baby all the other boys they donât see what I see
Now wonât you say you see it in me
Tamarinds and skinny jeans
Oh wonât you be my summer love
Take you walking through the garden
And take my heart when summer comes
