got me the strangest woman
believe me this trick's no cinch
but I really get her going
when I whip out my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
well a band that plays its blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
she said now stop that jivin'
now whip out your big 10 inch

record of a band that plays those blues
well a band that plays the blues
she just loves my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

I, I, I cover her with kisses
and when we're in a lover's clinch
she gets all excited
when she begs for my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays those blues
well a band that plays the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues

my girl don't go for smokin'
and liquor just make her flinch
seems she don't go for nothin'
'cept for my big 10 inch

record of a band that plays the blues
band that play the blues
she just love my big 10 inch
record of her favorite blues
