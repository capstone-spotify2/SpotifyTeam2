Daisy, you
shouldnât do the things you do
but youâre just so incapable of changing
you lie so well
I could never even tell
what were facts in your artful rearranging

But I came back for more
and you laughed in my face and you rubbed it in
cause Iâm a Labrador
and I run
when the gun
drops the dove again

when we first met
I was glad to be your pet
like a Lab I once had that we called Maisie
but fetching sticks
was the best I had for tricks
you got bored
you got mad then you got crazy

But I came back for more
and you laughed in my face and you rubbed it in
cause Iâm a Labrador
and I run
when the gun
drops the dove again

Daisy, daisy, give me your answer
daisy, daisy, doâ¦
remember good old Maisie how she waited at the
stairs for you

Daisy, dear
I could almost shed a tear
but letâs shine in the time we have remaining
youâre a tough old gal
but a dog is just a pal
and believe me, my dear,
Iâm not complaining

Cause I came back for more
cause I knew even you
did the best you could
And Iâm a Labrador
and with me, you could see
it was understood
that Iâd come back for more
cause Iâm a Labrador
the loyal Labrador
