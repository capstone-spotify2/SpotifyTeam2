Outside we're lonely but we are free
We're misfits, rebels, we're creeps and freaks
How come they've got it figured out
While we're lost, waiting to be found
Maybe we need something different now
For every broken bone and every lie you've told
Every time you're lost and you can't find home
This is for the ones who always feel alone

We are outsiders
Living inside a broken world
We are outsiders
And I know sometimes it can hurt
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue
We are outsiders
But we're not hiding anymore
This is who we really are

Inside they talk about all their plans
Must be nice to have someone light your path
But inside their hearts are breaking
'Cause they don't know what they're missing
Outside we're lonely but we are free
For every broken bone and every lie you've told
Every time you're lost and you can't find home
This is for the ones who always feel alone

We are outsiders
Living inside a broken world
We are outsiders
And I know sometimes it can hurt
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue
We are outsiders
But we're not hiding anymore
This is who we really are

For every broken bone and every lie you've told
Every time you're lost and you can't find home
This is for the ones who always feel alone

We are outsiders
Living inside a broken world
We are outsiders
And I know sometimes it can hurt
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue
We are outsiders
But we're not hiding anymore
This is who we really are
