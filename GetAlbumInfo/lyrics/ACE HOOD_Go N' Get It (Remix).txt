<i>[Hook: Ace Hood]</i>
Another day, another dollar
Every 24, I'm thinking money and the power
Bills due, money running low
Plus my cousin lost her mind and had an overdose
Way too many problems, got me stressed out
What you doing? You got 7 days to move out
Go on! Get it!
I'm out here chasing cream
Go on! Get it!
Need it, by any means...

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Mama went and got it, daddy never home
Started learning from the streets, but I know my heat a chrome
Never sold no kind of dope, just a real nigga
Take the canned foods, I'm tryna get a real dinner
Get your money stacked, your paper keep away the feds
Keep it real and fuck a hater
What my brother said
Keep my head high, nevermind them local jokers
Every day that I wake, I grind
Gotta make that monthly quota
Way too legit to quit though
Can't stop, no way, no slow-mo
Gotta feed the team and my kin folk
Think of all the stress that I've been through
Way too much fuckin problems
Way too much fuckin bills
By any means necessary, gotta see my momma in...

<i>[Hook: Ace Hood]</i>
Another day, another dollar
Every 24, I'm thinking money and the power
Go on! Get it!
Go on! Get it!
Go on! Get it!
I'm out here chasing cream
Go on! Get it!
Go on! Get it!
Go on! Get it!
Need it by any means

<i>[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]</i>
Black incorporated, Bo bangs mind frame
You for self nigga, organized crime wave
I pricked my finger, took my oath and wrote my name in blood
Kill everything, got baby bodies floating in the tub
Natural Born Killa nigga, nothing I'll as this
These knuckle-breathers stick the toothpick through the goldfish
You's a sucka nigga, greener than a blade of grass
I take the half a phone book blew him for 30 bangs
Gotta get it, while the getting's good
That Desert Eagle stainless steel, the handle cherry wood
I got that G-lock, 33 ladder works
I bag a bullet to your belly, make your bladder burst
Now you piss some blood, I'm fishing for grub
I'm in the water with the Great White, I'm whippin up
Don't make me hop out with that thing and start spraying shit
Chopper bullets longer than the Section 8 waiting list

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]</i>
Shine up all of the gun dere, keep dem shine and crisp
Cause if a nigga try to come in and try to get in the way
Of how I feed my family and
Try to dig up in my pockets it'll be a catastrophic little situation
And I'll be leaving him laying dead and gone all in his own piss
Father bless me: Jesus Christ
Cause I'm about to go and commit my worst sin
Just know that whenever we gonna defend it and survival
Of the people that I love and all the people that I feed
And I'm ready to kill and massacre anything
Moving past me the rachett, I'm shootin' muthafucka
Best believe I'm going in
See I go and I get it and then I STOP
Don't speed rap this, let me walk it to em
This topic we addressing so serious: let me talk to em
Look at my baby die, while they smile at me playful
Fuck you think I'm gonna do when the hunger gets painful?
Every day I hit the street and I taste it like grapefruit
I ain't eat your food yet - you better be grateful!
Be grateful that you had time to think that I overlooked it
And you had an extra day with it before I came and took it

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 4: Pusha T]</i>
Gotta get mine by any means
Malcolm X versus any king
Marched in this bitch for kilo green
Tony locked up, let freedom ring
Free the mind, it's beautiful
Ain't freeze the watches, it's 2 below
Ears are different, 2 below?
Got the rock on, super ho
Super fly, super paid
Niggas stunt hard as Super Dave
Yeah, where's my cape? You ain't gotta ask me where's the flake
In the pot, cooking base
MIAyo 808s: niggas wanna know why I link with Ace?
Black muthafucka with expensive taste
Hustle hard, just like me
Ice cream man, nigga, just like P
Murder you muthafuckas, they like see
Move that <i>[?]</i> just like D
Certified, walk the streets
Consequence, nigga, talk is cheap
You don't want a problem? Off the beef
Before I off his ass with his awful teeth

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 5: Styles P]</i>
Robbery turns into Murder 1
Murder 1: made it look like it's robbery
.44 show you boys vagina like pornography
Put your friends, get a Benz, inside's mahogany
Pretty bitch, let her stunt, classy suit
Nice shoes, smoke blowing, guns all around
Yeah the mob will meet. Now let's keep it G
On some ref shit
We don't trust each other, we don't know each other's address
I fuck your girl, crack your safe, slash the mattress
Nigga, you a actor, you a bitch, you's an actress
I go and get it, yeah G and G
I don't give a fuck, I hit your crib up with TNT
