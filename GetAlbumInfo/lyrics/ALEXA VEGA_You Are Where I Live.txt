Hey,
Show me the way
What are the rules?
How do you keep a family?
What is the key?
How do you stay together?

Whoa-oh, oh, oh!
If love is all you need to get along,
To be strong for each other
I'll give you all that I can give 
You are where I live

So hey,
It's a brand new day
Shouldn't we celebrate?
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
When you're dreams comes true?
When you're whole world turns over?

Whoa-oh, oh, oh!
It all seems so unreal,
So much to feel, 
So much to hold for the future
I'll give you all that I can give 
You are where I live

And if you promise not to laugh,
I'll admit I'm still scared
Of losing you and everything that's made me care.

But hey,
I'm really okay
I just can't believe,
I really found my family
Everybody could be
How did I get so lucky?

Whoa-oh, oh, oh!
I will never let you go
No matter what
No matter where this life takes me
I'll give you what I can give
You are where I live

You are where I live

I give you all I can give
You are where I live
I give you all I can give
You are where I live
I give you what I can give
Whoa-oh, oh!

So I can stay, right?
