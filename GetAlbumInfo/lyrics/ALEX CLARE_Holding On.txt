You stole my heart
The first time that I saw your face
It was the start
Of a never ending love
I never knew I was worthy of
And I knew that when I told her
I could see us growing older
From the confusion in my head
It was the truest thing I've said

I keep holding on
Holding on
Holding on
To you

We all have scars
That tell the story of the worlds
That we have seen
You got the stuff
The trials that we've been through
You got me, girl
And I got you

And when I feel insecure
You do your best to reassure
All my worries and my fears
Will be gone
I will crawl a million miles for you
It will never be enough
To know it's just
Just too strong

I keep holding on
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
To you
Holding on
Just holding on
Holding on
To you

This love is driving me crazy
This love is driving me crazy
I keep holding on
To you

Can't let go
No, I can't let go
I keep holding on
Keep holding on to you
Can't let go
Can't let go
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
To you
Holding on to you
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
To you
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
To you
