So many special reasons we are here, so in love
I feel so blessed because I know that we're in this love
You are the sun that lights the sky, you are the only one I need in my life

Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever

Yours is the sweetest song I've ever heard, or ever knew
I can't imagine living in this world, without you
I never thought that I could feel something so wonderful, something so real

Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever

Nothing is stronger than our love, nothing lasts longer than this love
Nothing is deeper than, sweeter than, loving you

Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever

And you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart
