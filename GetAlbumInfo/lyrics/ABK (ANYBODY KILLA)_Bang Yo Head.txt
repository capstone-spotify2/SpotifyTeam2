Don't fucking piss me off.
I said don't fuckin' piss me off.
Choke your fucking head.

I hurt myself to make the pain disappear.
and then I fear that if people see my scars they will call me weird. 
I'm out of control with it, I know I need help plus I'm tired of these cards that my life was dealt. And see that I am not the only one who cuts every time I think the world sucks. Is it a problem I have some kind of complication cause my only aggravation is my own dedication. I got a big heart that looks out for most even if I'm feeling lost paint it forward is how I roll. and I know that there's a lot more to gain even if we have a little happy pain. (Dick) So cut with me. I'm feeling born again every time my heart bleeds from the tip of my pen. Like I'm inhaling fresh oxygen instead of always being on the defensive end.

Bang yo head (Up against a wall, wish you were dead)
Slit yo wrist (Then hide the cuts so no one knows what you did)
I'm so pissed (as if the only way that I could forget)
Is to self inflect (a little pain to make me happy again) 
Bang yo head.

Yeah, I've been down on my mothafuckin' luck, I've lost jobs I've wanted to bang my head against a wall. Slit my wrists and bleed all over your brand new white tee shirt. Bitch WHAT!

Let the pain make you happy like a stress reliever. When the world got you feeling like a underachiever. In my 80's were like so depressive and if you know me well then you know I'm aggressive. I got a rap sheet for being a deadbeat. I guess I'm incomplete so my body i miss treat. It's like I really never did belong. So I made a theme song, come and sing along. If people hate me, I'm no good. I always say I'm miss understood. I been this way since my childhood and I've dealt it my way the best I could. I'm confident so I must attempt not to bang my head over no nonsense and if I do I face the consequence of finding out the hard way of having common sense.

Bang yo head ya'll. 
Let it hurt!
And if you wanna get really deep let the blood spill
Ill be mad than a mothafucka
I'm about to take the pain out on myself so I can be... Happy again.
