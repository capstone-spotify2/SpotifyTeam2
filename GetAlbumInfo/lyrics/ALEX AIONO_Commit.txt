Where do I go, when all I have is right here
What do I know, when you taught me how to love
How do I grow, when my heart is getting ripped out
And I'm left to learn to live without you

Every dose, every single ounce inside of me loves you the most
And it kills me it's the only thing keeping us close
Cuz you ain't ready and we're steadily losing hope, we're losing hope
But I, I won't go

Cuz I know we are destined
And I know we can get there
But it's not a one man job
So commit to us and give in to love
Girl commit to us and give in to love

What do I say when your reason makes no sense for breaking away
I know your feelings are unsure but baby it's okay
Cuz I got time and we got space to play our games
So play your games
Cuz I, I won't go

Cuz I know we are destined
And I know we can get there
But it's not a one man job
So commit to us and give in to love
Girl commit to us and give in to love

Baby we have come so far and I know it's the hardest part
But I will be here through it all, cuz that is true love

Cuz I know we are destined
And I know we can get there
But it's not a one man job
So commit to us and give in to love
Girl commit to us and give in to love
