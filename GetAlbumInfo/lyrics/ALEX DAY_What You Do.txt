Come, come up to meet
You and I see
All of the world inside your eyes
And I am alive

You move closer to me
I know what you need
I'm gonna set your heart on fire
Feel you inside

I'm addicted to what you do
I'm in love with the way you move
Breathing in every word you say
And all of the promises you make
I know you'll keep them

Legs twisting round me
Hearing you speak
Saying the things I need to hear
We disappear

Your skin against me
Slide desperately
Tingles are slipping down my spine
You make you mine

I'm addicted to what you do
I'm in love with the way you move
Breathing in every word you say
And all of the promises you make
I know you'll keep them

I'm addicted to what you do
I'm in love with the way you move
Breathing in every word you say
And all of the promises you make
Oh God I need them
