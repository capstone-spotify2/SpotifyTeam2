Rodeo, rodeo star
Rodeo, rodeo star

Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
Played good guys he played bad
But Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
And that's the greatest thing he had

What do men do to impress you 
And me the highball schemin'
He plays guitar and gets the girl
Rr plants his flag at Iwo Jima

Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
Played good guys he played bad
But Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
And that's the greatest thing he had

Boost it up now mr. Booster
The chances are quite slimming
Here on earth I feel so weak
Like Samson with a trimming

Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
Played good guys he played bad
But Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen
And that's the greatest thing he had

Happy as a punk in Boys Town (rodeo)
No more talk of doing (rodeo star)
We'll be fine in lust we trust (rodeo)
While they stand in the ruin (rodeo star)

Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen (no no no no no)
Played good guys he played bad (no no no no no no no)
But Steve McQueen was Steve McQueen (no no no no no)
And that's the greatest thing that he had (no no no no no no no)

What do men do to impress you (rodeo)
And me the highball schemin' (rodeo star)
He plays guitar and gets the girl (rodeo)
Or plants his flag at Iwo Jima (rodeo star)
