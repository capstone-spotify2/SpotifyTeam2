Sky is gray
Moon is pale
Find the missing colors
Smoke like in the air

Never been
Haven't seen
A shelter to get over
A secret hideaway

Rescue me, you're all I have
Turn to me come take my hand
Don't know where I stand
Nowhere to be found

Rescue me, let love suffice
Let illusions leave my eyes
Temporary lies
Turn to paradise

Rescue me
Rescue me

Another day
Not astray
Gather shattered pieces
While you are on your way

All I see
Is you and me
Clear as the waters
Pure as it can be

Rescue me, you're all I have
Turn to me come take my hand
Don't know where I stand
Nowhere to be found

Rescue me, let love suffice
Let illusions leave my eyes
Temporary lies
Turn to paradise

Imaginary lines
Drifting on my mind
Lighten up the burden inside
Wait until tomorrow
Soon the sun will rise
We'll be together in time

Rescue me, you're all I have
Turn to me come take my hand
Don't know where I stand
Nowhere to be found

Rescue me, let love suffice
Let illusions leave my eyes
Temporary lies
Turn to paradise

Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, rescue me
