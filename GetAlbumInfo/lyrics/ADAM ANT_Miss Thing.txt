Miss Thing what you got to say?
We saw a honey just the other day
A wild cat, a loud shirt
Thinking up stuff just to different
Wa-la-ba-loomba
Wa-la-ba-loomba
Wa-la-ba-loomba
Wa-la-ba-loom
She was the only one to love him up right
Miss Thing - where you gonna go?
You ever seen a man jump a piano?
Guttertalk, knock 'em dead
Pompadour six inches above his head
Wa-la-ba-loomba.... <i>[etc.]</i>
Miss Thing please tell me why
He says "child" when he meets another guy
Sweaty staggering out of the swamp
Freaky-deak dancing, pumping that pomp
Wa-la-ba-loomba.... <i>[etc.]</i>
Turn it up
Have your fill
Up in the treble
A voice like a power drill.
