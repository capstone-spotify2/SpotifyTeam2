<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
This is my rain dance
(So let it rain)
This is my rain dance
(Iâmma let it rain)
This is my rain dance
Sorry if I rained on your parade

As the world turns and the wind blows
I can make it rain with a dance, yo
Watch the earth shift like some loose hips
Iâm calling bluffs from haters with them thunder lips
Let me get a second, watch this killa wreck it
On top, at times hated but well respected
I can make it rain on your parade
Anytime you want it I can make it go for days
Have you inside looking out at me
As Iâm dancing in the streets
Making it pour with the heat
Let the rain fall straight from the sun
May it wash away the pain that so hard to overcome
Donât waste your time dripping til you get dropped
If thereâs anger in your heart, kill it so it never stops
Quit living life over a safety net
Ainât no reason to be worried,
Come on out and get wet, the waters cold

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

In the night, getting light, when it strikes
Whoever said that it never hits twice
Grab your umbrellas because Iâm giving hail
Whoâs sporting floods I heard the rain coming as well
Itâs about to get crazy muddy black piles with a face look strangely
Cold chills on your neck when the wind blows
Every place I stomp on this earth it just explodes
Dancing in the puddle like a kid I can see the clouds coming in
Shake the underground like a tornado at a full peak
Ainât a Doppler in the world seeing what I bring
Let it rain on your face so your minds refreshed
Let it flow down your throat so you rhyme the best
Some say I bring the fountain of youth when it rains
While other sing a song to try and make it go away

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

I would let it rain until we all clean
Wash away the dirty history this world brings
Stay shinin even though Iâm muddy
Always starin in the face of people lookin at me funny
Feel the cold air, donât be so scared,
Just know one day that theyâll get theirs
Only a few understand what there is to gain
When you underneath the black sky dancing in the rain

<i>[Chorus (til end)]</i>

Rain, rain, go away
Please come back another day <i>[x2]</i>
