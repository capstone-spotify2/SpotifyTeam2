She said she'd never been, hummm
Never been touched before
She said she'd never been
This far before
She said she'd never liked, hummm
To be excited
She said she always had
Had to fight it
And she never won
She said she'd never been
Never been balled before
And I don't think
She'll ever ball no more
Fixed her good

Hey
(Squealer) when I held her hand
(Squealer) I made her understand
(Squealer) when I kissed her lips
(Squealer) sucked her finger tips, hey
(Squealer) oohh started getting hot
(Squealer) oohh made it hard to stop
(Squealer) got too much
(Squealer) I think I've got the magic touch, aaah

(Squealer...)
