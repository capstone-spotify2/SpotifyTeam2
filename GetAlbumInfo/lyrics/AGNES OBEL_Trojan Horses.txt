These bare bones are made of glass
See-through to the marrow when they pass
Seek through the keyhole, a fate is cast
Deep in the mirror smiling back

In shapes like these, they run softly

Trojan horses, Trojan horses

Gardens grow in my eyes
Oh why do they?
Gardens grow in my eyes
Oh why do they?

Seek what I seek in a blinding flash
These bare bones are made of glass

In shapes like these, they run softly

Trojan horses with all the children

I tell myself I wanna hide
I tell myself I wanna be lied to
Silent reader of my mind, do you know what i will ask of you?
Tell me if you wanna hide
Tell me if you wanna be lied to
