Ohhhh
Can't sleep, too many tears to remember
Can't believe, its this close to December
And here I am, alone in the dark
Suddenly missing you so
I'm tired, pretending I don't love you
Then you're with me, and everything that I do
There you are, so dear in my heart
But still I just can't let you go
That's why I came here so you know

That I don't wanna live, if living's without you
And that i would give, my all, just for one more day
Don't tell me it's over, cause for me, it has just begun
Baby, please lets give us one last try
I can give you what money can't buy

If you let me be there, every moment beside you
Feel love, and let feelings just guide you
And trust in me, and you'll never be hurt
Cause I'll keep you safely you know
That's why I came here so you know

That I, I don't wanna live, live without you
And that i would give, my all, just for one more day
Don't tell me it's over, cause for me, it has just begun
Baby, please lets give us one last try
I can give you what money can't buy

Ohhh
It's not about money no
I'm so tired, by pretending I don't love you
That's why I, I just can't let you go
That's why I came here to let you know

Cause I don't wanna live, if living's without you
And that i would give, my all, just for one more day
Don't tell me it's over, cause for me, it has just begun
Baby, please lets give us one last try
I can give you what money can't buy
