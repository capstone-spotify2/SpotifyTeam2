It was about eleven thirty, you hit up my phone
You sounded all worried, wondering if I was home home home
I knew that was something
Uh, I know there is something wrong
He had you all messed up, he didn't even call call call
Said you need a little space
Girl, you need to clear
Girl, you need to clear your mind
And I met you right outside

Soon as I opened up the door
I knew I'd seen that look before
'Cause you know that I've been reading your mind
So if you really really wanna go there tonight
We can cross that line, we're bout to be more than friends
We're bout to be more than friends
You and I can kiss that friends for goodbye
We can cross that line, we're bout to be more than friends
We're bout to be more than friends

You know what I'm talkin' bout
You know how it's going down
More than friends,
We got to be more than friends

So now you're friend with my body
Is it just for tonight?
I don't share with nobody
You gonna have to be mine mine mine
Said you need a little space
Girl, you need to clear
Girl, you need to clear your mind
Tell me why you got my place?
'Cause it's gonna be your last time

Soon as I opened up the door
