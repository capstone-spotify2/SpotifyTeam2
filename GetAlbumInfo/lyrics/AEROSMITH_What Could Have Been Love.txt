I wake up and wonder how everything went wrong.
Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train.
Now that train has come and gone.
I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed.
And I'm still dreaming of that day.

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.

An old friend told me that you found somebody new.
Oh, you're finally moving on.
You think that I'd be over you after all these years.
Yeah, but time has proved me wrong.
'Cause I'm still holdin' on.

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
(What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.

We've gone our separate ways.
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are.
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slipping through my hands and I didn't understand.

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
(What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.
What could have been love will never be.
What could have been love
What could have been love
What could have been love...
