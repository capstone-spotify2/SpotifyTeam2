I am trouble walkin'
I am every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin'
Out on the street there's a lesson learned
You play with and you'll get burned
On the newsstand there's another book
Out on the street what count is the way you look
<i>[Chorus:]</i>
There ain't no doubt I got what you need
You'll be beggin' baby please, please, please
With every switch sharper than a blade
I got you in my sights you can't escape
<i>[Chorus]</i>
No matter where you run
No matter where you hide
Out here there's a rule you'll find
Only the strong survive
<i>[Chorus]</i>
