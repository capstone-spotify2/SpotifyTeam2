Welcome, welcome to the jungle
Where things will never be the same
You can try to hang on the outside
But in time your well will run dry

I said welcome, welcome to the jungle
Where things will never be the same
You can try to hang on the outside
But in time your well will run dry
I said welcome

I said welcome, welcome to the jungle
Where things will never be the same
You can try to hang on the outside
But in time your well will run dry

Said in time your well will run dry
Said in time your well will run dry
Said in time your well will run dry
