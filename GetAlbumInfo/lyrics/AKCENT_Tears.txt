I can't find the words to express my pain
Everything I gave you it was all in vein
All the love we had washes with the rain
Try to break the clouds and bring back the sun
Spread away the shadow
Let's have some fun
Wipe your tears away
Your gonna have to run

Why you try to say goodbye
Please don't start to cry
You will find the answer
Leave the past behind
Begin to free your mind
Nothing can go wrong

Please don't start to cry
You will find the answer

Let's go back in time and forget our tears
Let me hold your hands
Send away your fears
Try to understand
I won't let you fall
I will find a way to release your heart
I will make you smile just like from the start
We are meant to be and never stay apart

Why you try to say goodbye
Please don't start to cry
You will find the answer
Leave the past behind
Begin to free your mind
Nothing can go wrong
