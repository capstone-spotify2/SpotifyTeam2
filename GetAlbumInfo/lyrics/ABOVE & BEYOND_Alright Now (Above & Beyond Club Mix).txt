I've lived a little.
I've loved a lot.
I lost myself to you.
We tied our dreams up in a lovers knot
But none of them came true.
My solid ground soon turned to quicksand.
The warm winds turn to frost.
Where does love go
When it has no plan?
When everything is lost?
The only thing that I forgot
Was that we walk alone.
I'm learning how to stand again,
A steady hand again.

I'm going to be O.K.
I'm going to be just fine.
I'm gonna be alright now (alright now).
I'm going to make a break (I'm going to make a break).
I'm going to take my time (I'm going to take my time).
I'm going to be alright now (I'm going to be alright).
Alright now.

You said you'd love me bigger than the universe the sun and all the stars.
You said that there was nothing that we couldn't overcome and yet we fell apart.
We fell apart.
