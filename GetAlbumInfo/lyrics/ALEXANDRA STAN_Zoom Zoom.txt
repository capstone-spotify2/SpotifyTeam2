Gimme gimme

Tonight we gonna fall in love,
Tonight I wanna tell you something
You're everything I'm dreaming of
Say oh yeah, ooh oh yeah

Can you see it when you look in my eyes?
Can you feel it? I wanna take you for a drive
Let's make it in the backseat, baby
Say oh yeah, ooh oh yeah

Cause I'm mysterious, I'm so furious
I wanna get to know your heart
(Don't play your game, don't play your game)
I want the two of us to get serious
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for?!
(So what you saaaay?)
Let me take you on a ride!

You got to kick it kick it
Catch me on the rewind
Whip it, whip it
Tell me on the countdown
Zoom zoom zoom zoom
Gimme gimme
Boom boom boom boom
Lala lala, crack it on the speaker
Higher higher, rock we gonna step on
Zoom zoom zoom zoom
Gimme gimme
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom
We go zoom zoom

I like, come on to take the lead,
We're cruising into the full-moon rising
I'll let you get behind the wheel
Say oh yeah, ooh oh yeah
And when we're driving just put your hand in my hand,
The stars are shinning
I want you say you'll be my man
Enjoy me in the backseat baby!
Say oh yeah, ooh oh yeah
Cause I'm mysterious, I'm so furious
I wanna get to know your heart
(Don't play your game, don't play your game)
I want the two of us to get serious
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for?!
(So what you saaaay?)
Let me take you on a ride!
