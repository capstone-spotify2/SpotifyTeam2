Dream on, little dreamer! This is how it all begins
Move your feet ~ feel how sweet it is
Dream on, little dreamer! Follow all of your signs
You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you

You got to go

You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
You know you got to go!
Keep on, little dreamer ~ keep hold of all that you are
