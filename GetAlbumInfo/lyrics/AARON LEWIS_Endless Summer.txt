In the mornin' on a Saturday
I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio
Ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes me smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer

Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer.

Now we're at our little getaway
Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh striper on the grill tonight
Cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer

Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer.

Monday morning and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio and my three girls know every line

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
This endless summer

Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
These endless summer nights.
