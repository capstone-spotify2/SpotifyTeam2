If you follow the jaw line down over the heart, 
the curves of your bone and muscle that make up your head to toe... 
It's just skin and thread, stitches and ligaments, 
words that we spoke only to regret. 

And I know they're going to laugh at us 
when they, when they see us out together "holding hands" like this. 
They wouldn't understand it if we told them all the reasons,
not that I think this deserves any kind of explanation. 

And we'll, we'll make it up so we've got a smile painted on all the time, 
no matter what it's like on the inside. 
We'll keep this, keep us like a secret, 
cause if my family and friends ever found out about 
the things we could never be, 
haunts we'll all keep, so fucking bittersweet.

And I know they're going to laugh at us 
when they, when they see us out together "holding hands" like this. 
They wouldn't understand it if we told them all the reasons,
not that I think this deserves any kind of explanation.
