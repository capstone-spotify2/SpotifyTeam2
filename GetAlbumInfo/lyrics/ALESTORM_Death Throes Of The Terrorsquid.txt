From the deep there's a terror rising
A great beast with eyes like crimson fire
Leviathan returns to devour the world
Set a course, the time for slaughter
To the heart of the raging oceans blue
This time the beast will meet its doom
Eternal doom

Legends spoke of the ancient monster
From a time beyond the dawn of time
In a pit of primordial ooze
Many years we have been kept waiting
But tonight that squid will surely die
Revenge is a dish best served fried
Deep fried

Deathsworn, Oathbound
On a quest for vengeful slaughter
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky
Deathsworn, Oathbound
No gods shall be our master
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky

With a crash of thunder
Our ship sails 'cross the waves
On a course to the frozen arctic seas
We've defeated vikings
And ninjas we hath slain
The terrorsquid won't escape again
Never again

Deathsworn, Oathbound
On a quest for vengeful slaughter
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky
Deathsworn, Oathbound
No gods shall be our master
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky

Poseidon's realm falls silent... THE BEAST AWAKENS!

Between the bounds of light and death
Rides the serpent, Uroboros
Supine before the altar of doom
Enter into the Cthonic lair

A raging torrent of smoke and fire
Lightning from across the bow
Hear the death throes of the terrorsquid
The doom of leviathan draws near

Thunderous volleys from the thirty-two pounder gun strike the beast, as our vessel moves in for the killing blow.
From the bow of the ship the great harpoon is fired, impaling through the monster's cursed eyes.
With a final scream of terror, Leviathan rears up in defeat, and is vanquished for all eternity.
