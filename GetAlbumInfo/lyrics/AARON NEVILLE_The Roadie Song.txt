You know night after night these guys are setting up, hooking up,
Climbing past the sky. they don't really get no praise,
So I wrote this song in honor of them,
'cause without them there'd be no show.

So get a roadie song, after all he ain't no bum
Give a roadie a hand, he's really part of the band

Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
Them speakers weigh a ton
His work is never done
So get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song

Got a mighty long ways to travel
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel
He's gotta long long ways to go
And if he don't make it, there ain't gonna be no show

So give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie song
He climbed to kingdom come
He's up to see the sun
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song

He's got a mighty long ways to travel
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel
He's gotta long long ways to go
And if he don't make it, there ain't gonna be no show

Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song, after all he ain't no bum
And get a roadie a hand, he's really part of the band
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie song
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give a roadie song
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give a roadie song
