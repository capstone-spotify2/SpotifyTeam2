I got your letter, read that mom was gone
(Mom was gone)
I never thought that dad would ever lose his mind
(Lose his mind)
I haven't slept it seems like all week long
(all week long)
And I've prayed a thousand times

To a god who doesn't take request
and all I hear is kid become the dream
Become the dream
You said it once I've heard it twice
You'll always make mistakes in life
Become the dream 

I held this letter in my hand 
and start to shake
then wonder is the end
is this the end?
I took for granted 
all the things you've given me 
I say this is the end

I'll raise my fist
Shout and scream
I wont resist this life 
Become the dream
Become the dream

I'll raise my fist
Shout and scream
I wont resist this life 
Become the dream
Become the dream
