Go back and forward, 
but all is melting like the snow
Taking all from us, 
all we thought was left to know

On what we treasure 
falls a dusty snow
taking us backwards 
but where we will never know

Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track

This strong old blizzard 
I will let it blow
to undiscovered places 
underneath the snow

Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track ...
