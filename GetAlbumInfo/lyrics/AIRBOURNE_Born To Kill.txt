If you beat a dog for all his life 
You better pray he doesn't survive 
Coz every hit stays on his mind 
He won't forget till the day he dies 
He'll hunt you down like the dog you are 
Sink his teeth in and tear you apart 
I know how he feels I' lookin through his eyes 
You hit me again your ganna relies 
I was born to kill until the day I die 

Born to Kill 
It's a way of life 
Born to kill 
Until I die 

With freight train force and volume high 
We take no shit we don't compromise 
Coz we don't care for your rules 
We do it our way we do it old school 
Coz rock'n'roll will never change 
Not fpr you or the laws you make 
Coz its never loud for a rock'n#Roll crowd 
We'll shake this place to the ground 
No DB limit is gonna stop us now 

Born to Kill 
It's a way of life 
Born to kill 
Until I die 
Until the day, until the day I die 

Born to kill if you beat a dog 
Born to kill for all his life 
Born to kill you better pray 
Born to kill he doesn't survive 

Born to Kill 
It's a way of life 
Born to kill 
Until I die 

Born to kill 
Born to kill 
Born to kill 
Born to kill 

You know I said I'm born to kill 
I said I'm born to kill 
Born to kill 
I said I'm born to kill 
Until the day I die
