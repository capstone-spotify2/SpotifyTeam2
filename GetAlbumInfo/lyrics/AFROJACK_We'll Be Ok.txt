Hundred years ago someone said to me
You can change the World by the way you speak
But every word you hear is every word you say
I could see the feelings written on your face
You don't believe in love
You don't believe it's true
You don't know where I go
You don't know what I do
If I could make you see the way it supposed to be
Only love could set you free

We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh
We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh

A hundred years from now
Maybe we'll turn around and
See the flowers growing in the battle grounds
Let's go to sleep tonight, wake up another day
When we can built a world that's made of different shades
I still believe in love
I still believe it's true
I'm takin' where I've been and see what I can do
I'm tryina make you see the way it ought to be
Only love could set you free

We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh
We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh

Hold my hand,
You know we can learn to love again
And I'll never hurt you! I'll be your friend
Yeah, for better or worst
Just don't let go, goo!!

We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh
We'll be ok ooh oh
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play ooh oh oh
We'll be ok oh ooh oh
