Can't stop tossin' and turnin' at night
It gets harder each day, fighting with this feeling inside

You can swear that you love me
By every star in the sky
But when you're close to me
You get that look in you eye
A burning feeling, you just can't disguise

Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love
Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love

We need each other its easy to see
You know I'm shaking all over thinking how good this could be

You can tell me you need me
And you can tell me you're mine
But when you're in my arms
The words starts spinning and we lose all track of time

Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love
Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love
