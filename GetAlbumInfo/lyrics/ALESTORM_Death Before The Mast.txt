First light reflects off the ocean
All crew now set into motion
Another day like many before it
Hard life, no way to ignore it
Behold! A cry from the crow's nest
A ship appears from the south west
The years below deck that bored me
All lead to what lies before me

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast

Too late to lay low or outrun
Up close we're outmanned and outgunned
Prepare to rush forth, unleash hel
Cross swords in one final farewell
Hulls crash, our vessel is boarded
No mercy or tact is afforded
But now the King's men draw closer
Seems like it may all be over

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast
