The sun never shone that day
From an early dawn the sky was grey
I never should've walked away
I know that now, but I'm here to say:

Everybody walks away
Everybody's led astray
Breaking every plan to stay
It happens all the time
The sun never shone that day
From an early dawn the sky was grey
I never should've walked I know
I see that now, but it's hard to show

Everybody's got to go
Everybody tells you so
Everybody wants to know
Why it happens all the time

I can't see the point of turning everything upside down
I can't see the point of greeting everything with a frown
I can't see the point of painting everything black or white
I can't see the point of leaving everyone full of doubt (oh doubt)

The sun never shone that day
From an early dawn the sky was grey
I never should've walked away
I see that now, but I'm here to say

Everybody holds their own
Everybody lives alone
Everybody hogs the phone
It happens all the time

Everybody feels the strain
Everybody holds the pain
Everybody stays the same
It happens all the time

I can see the point of turning everything upside down
I can see the point of greeting everything with a frown
I can see the point of painting everything black or white
I can see the point of leaving everyone full of doubt
Everyone full of doubt

The sun never shone that day
