Unraveling, unrolled, a siren in the night
I love the jaundice of your skin
Its perverse plasticity
You make me want to smoke cigarettes
You make me want to drink whiskey

But even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me

My sycophant love song, my authentic desperation
I'm addicted to the feeling, the only kind of steady I believe in
Prison cell exercises, solitary sport entertainment
What makes you think you're gonna die any different?

Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me

Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't save me

Don't worry, young suicides, the vultures will pick your bones dry
Half digested and eternal, somewhere lost in the ephemeral
Welcome to the future, an always ice-cold nightmare
Burnt coffee and Percocets, yeah, this night, too, will end

Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
