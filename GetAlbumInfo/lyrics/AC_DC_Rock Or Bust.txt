Hey yeah
Are you ready

We be a guitar band
We play across the land
Shootin' out tonight
Gonna keep you up alright

You hear the guitar sound
Playin' nice and loud
Rock you to your knees
Gonna make your destiny

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

We hear the siren scream
It sounds so lean to me
We love to shake it down
Know what we're talkin' bout

We turn the amps up high
The crowd's gonna hit the sky
We play it fast and loose
Because this night we're gonna pull a fuse

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
