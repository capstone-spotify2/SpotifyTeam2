If I could do it all again
I'd look more in the mirror
Instead of finding someone else to blame
If I could do it all again
I'd do a lot more praying
Less cussing 'bout the things that I can't change
I'd laugh a little louder
Sing more in the shower
Care a little less if I'm in tune
Concentrate on who I am not who I might have been
If I could do it all again

If I could do it all again
I'd take it a little slower
Make a few more memories I could keep
I'd crawl in bed beside my wife and just lay down and watch her
Soaking up her beauty while she sleeps

I'd work less hours
I'd buy her more flowers
Make more love on rainy afternoons
Overlook my little faults and not my little sins
If I could do it all again

I'd walk a little taller
Talk a little smaller
Love the way my maker meant me to
I might make less money but I'd make a better friend
If I could do it all again
If I could do it all again
