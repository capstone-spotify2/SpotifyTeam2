Don't like your stare
Don't like the arm in the air
Your style is so brash
And that silly moustache
But it was
Tabletalk

Evil I see
Sends bad vibrations through me
And oh what a square
With your diagonal hair
But it was
Tabletalk

Oh I said to Geli
"How do you do
Tabletalk?"
Oh I said to Geli
"How do you do
Tabletalk?"

And this is what she said;
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."

The love of his life
Too close to become a wife
And the death of this girl
Came close to saving the world
From his
Tabletalk

Oh I said to Geli
"How do you do
Tabletalk?"
Oh I said to Geli
"'How do you do
Tabletalk?"

And this is what she said;
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
"Love love love love yeah..."
