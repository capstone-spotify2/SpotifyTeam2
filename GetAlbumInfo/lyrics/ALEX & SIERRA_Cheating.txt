Do you ever think about cheating on me?
Where would you go and who would it be?
One of my friends or a celebrity
Do you ever think about cheating on me?

Do you ever think about a one-night stand?
Leaving the club at 3 a.m.
With a male model or guy from a band
Do you ever think about a one-night stand?

Woah, if you tell me no, that's not an answer I'd believe
There's not a single soul who hasn't had that fantasy
But on the other side you know the grass ain't always green

Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?
Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?

Do you ever think about breaking up?
Throwin' in the towel cause you've had enough
Turn around the car cause the road looks rough
Do you ever think about breaking up?

Woah, if you tell me no, that's not an answer I'd believe
There's not a single soul who hasn't had that fantasy
But on the other side you know the grass ain't always green

Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?
Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?

Lalalalalalala-lie
Lalalalalalala-lie

On the other side you know the grass ain't always green

Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?
Oh, do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?
Do you ever, do you ever think about cheating on me?
