When you ask what's on my mind
I'm like "Who wants to know it, who wants to know it?"
Gotta give me something true
Kinda used to living my life the way that I want it, way that I want it
Then I lose myself with you

Would it still be the same if I came and opened up
Got a feeling, got a feeling 'bout you
Could you swear that my secrets are safe in the name of love?
Got a feeling, got a feeling 'bout you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You only get what you give
You only get what you give
I wanna see you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You only get what you give
You only get what you give
I wanna see you
