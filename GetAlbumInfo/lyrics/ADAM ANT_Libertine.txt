A word from her is worth ten from me
Her main concern is honesty
She beat the selfishness right out of me
The wild eyed child
She's my libertine
My only books were women's looks
And the more I read, the less I said
She wanted to search inside me
To find this so-called purity
She acts the films that I can't see
The wild eyed child
She's my libertine
She showed me the slim chance I'd got
And all the friendships baby, that I had not
Be sure she has the guts of three
The wild eyed child
She's my libertine
I know a girl she's got a lust for danger
Thinks being tough makes her the Lone Ranger
But when the chips are down it's loving she craves
She's just another Aphrodite slave
