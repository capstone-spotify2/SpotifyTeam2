One more time, one more time,
Live it one more time, one more time.

What if you never see tomorrow again,
And it's the last party that you attend,
Let's live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end.
So invite all your family and friends
Cause they should be here celebrating,
Let's make the best of this time that we spend,
Cause if this is the end, I want you to,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up.

We party people put your hands high,
I know you're drunk and I know you're high
Don't lecture me, I won't lecture you,
Only got one life, you know what to do
So leave your sorrow and your pain
Leave your fortune and your fame
You can leave it all behind 'cause you'll never see it again
And when you're thinking back to this day I want to you to be able to say
That you would gladly do it again, gladly do it again!

What if you never see tomorrow again,
And this is the last party that you attend,
Let's live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end.
So invite all your family and friends
Cause they should be here celebrating,
Let's make the best of this time that we spend,
Cause if this is the end, I want you to
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up.

Live it one more time, one more time!
Live it one more time, one more time!

You've got a problem, this ain't the place (hey)
You wanna solve it, then we'll reserve a space (hey)
You rock with me, I'll rock with you (hey)
Only got one life you know what to do (hey)
So leave your sorrow and your pain
Leave your fortune and your fame
You can leave it all behind 'cause you'll never see it again
And when you're thinking back to this day I want to you to be able to say
That you would gladly do it again, gladly do it again!

What if you never see tomorrow again,
And this is the last party that you attend,
Just live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end.
So invite all your family and friends
Cause they should be here celebrating,
Let's make the best of this time that we spend,
Cause if this is the end, I want you to
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up,
Live like you don't plan to wake up.

Live it one more time, one more time!
Live it one more time! one more time!
