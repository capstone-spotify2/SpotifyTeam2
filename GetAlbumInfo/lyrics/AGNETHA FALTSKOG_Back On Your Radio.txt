Are you picking up my signals again?
Back on your radio
I'm sending you a message

I've been caught inside a radio shadow
For the longest time
Living on outside the range of your love
For the longest time
Tell me, have you been listening to the static
Searching for the echoes of me and you?
Baby loosing you was tragic.
Tell me now, am I getting through?

Are you picking up my signals again?
Back on your radio
I'm sending you a message again
Back on your radio, been
Thinking about you lately
Dreaming about you
Push that reset button baby
Turn that magic dial
Tune into my frequency
I missed you for a long while

Uhhhâ¦â¦

Lately I have heard the whispers of you
In the windy trees
Even though you might be light years away
It puts my heart at ease
Tell me, maybe love is in the static
That you're still out there after all
Maybe just like in the old times
Operator place a long distance call

Are you picking up my signals again?
Back on your radio
I'm sending you a message again
Back on your radio, been
Thinking about you lately
Dreaming about you
Push that reset button baby
Turn that magic dial
Tune into my frequency
I missed you for a long while

I believe, I believe, I believe
You came around
And sat on my bedside
I believe, I believe in my heart
We're always together, never apart

Are you picking up my signals again?
I'm sending you a message again
Are you picking up my signals again?
Back on your radio
I'm sending you a message again
Back on your radio, been
Thinking about you lately
Dreaming about you
Push that reset button baby
Turn that magic dial

Are you picking up my signals again?
Back on your radio
I'm sending you a message again
Back on your radio, been
Thinking about you lately
Dreaming about you
Push that reset button baby
Turn that magic dial
Tune into my frequency
I missed you for a long while
