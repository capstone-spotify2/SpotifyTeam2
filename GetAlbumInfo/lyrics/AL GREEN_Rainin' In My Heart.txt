Standing on the edge of the world
I'm looking for you, baby, yeah
I've keep looking at the sun
But it's rainin' in my heart

I don't know when life begins
I sure don't know when life might end, oh baby
I've keep looking at the sun
But it's rainin' in my heart, oh baby
(Rainin', rainin' in my heart)

Even though what's said or done
My love for you is eternal one
But how can I say bye with a love so deep
It seems like it's rainin' all over me

I can't understand for the love of me
Why can't it be like it used to be
Stop the rain, stop the rain
Rainin' in my heart

Seems like it was only yesterday
We're so in love, so in love just pays
I've keep looking at the sun
Somehow it keeps rainin' in my heart
Keep rainin', keep rainin', keep rainin'

Even though what's said or done
My love for you is an eternal one
But how can I say bye with a love so deep
I keep praying and it keeps rainin'

Somebody stop the rain
Yeah, now somebody stop the rain, rain, yeah
Somebody to see me
Somebody stop the rain, oh yeah

'Cause it seems like, seems like
Seems like it's gonna keep rainin'
It keeps on rainin', it keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin', keeps on rainin'

And how can I say bye
