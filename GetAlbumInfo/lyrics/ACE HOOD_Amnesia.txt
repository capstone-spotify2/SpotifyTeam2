I think these niggas got amnesia
I see these niggas got
Oh

Knock knock bang bang, let the beast out
Welcome to the deep side
Chucking up the peace sign
Mean time, trying to tally up the green guys
Nothing for a weak mind
Most these niggas read mine
Penitentiary, I'm still screamin' free mine
Glock 9 do a nigga just like a stop sign
Everybody got a Rollie, but it's my time
I think it's funny when they hating on the sideline
Only nigga that can go and get a miss and
Then jump right back with the mitts like Barry Bonds
Right back like I never left, ooh
I got stripes, ain't never ref
My girl booty like a teddy bear
Go get the money boo, it's everywhere, ay

Feel like they forgot about a nigga
Boy you looking at the illest
Point them out and I'mma get them
Oh Jesus
I think these niggas got amnesia
I tried to tell them but they did not believe me
I see these nigga's got amnesia
Ether

Young black mother fucker with an attitude
Screaming fuck cops cuz they shooting up the avenue
Black man and my pants full of revenue
Not crack residue, fuck what they telling you
Real nigga, G code what I'm sticking to
LOL to them niggas told me what I never do
I married the money, but still got a side piece
Back in the building they hoping it could not be
You rap niggas got a dead line
I'm at your neck like a bow-tie, whew
Word to my nigga Ray Ray, shit
Everything's on the left side, oh
Keep sleeping, white coupe two seated, with the roof, I don't need it
On you mad, so be it, huh
These rap dudes come and go like the bus
Do you ever need a job, come see me in a year or two
Easy

I think these niggas got amnesia
I tâ¦ did not believe me
I think these niggas got amnesia
Ether

Enough is enough is, I guess I gotta show niggas
What you doing where you at where you been, nigga
In the gym moving weight like a dope dealer
Been realer in the studio with the wrist whippin'
Big business, got the south on my back boy
You want a feature? 50 bands on the invoice
Aww shit, here we go again
Another nigga came from nothin, acting arrogant
Another black motherfucker thinking all us trouble
Niggas hating so much, I bought a bigger benz, whew
Pulling up like, âRemember me?â
Even Drake know they trying to drain your energy
I got the game sleeping on me, but my Glock stay woke
Couple of places in my hood that you just can't go, ay

Feel like they forgot about a nigga
Boy you looking at the illest
Point 'em out and I'mma get em
Oh Jesus
I think these niggas got amnesia
I tried to tell 'em but they would not believe me
I think these niggas got amnesia
Ether

I think these niggas got amnesia
I tried to tell 'em but they did not believe me
Hoe, I think these nigga's got amnesia
How could they forget about the reaper?
