RIP the homies take ah ride wit me take ah ride wit me

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Man it was jus the other day ever thing was all good
Memba like yesterday when we was chillin in da hood
Dreaminâ of bigga thing as ah younga nigga should
Wanna take care of da fam we jus wishin that we could
Notha day and da dolla steady chasin the commas
Studio went fa hours I'm snappinâ like ah piranha
Only was 17 but loyality was da honor 
Ridin round in that bubble he keep the eagle for drama
Man I put dat on my life dats my muthafuckin dawg
Anybody want problem dats da nigga Iâd call
Jus kno he comminâ runnin wit da shit da clear da mall
Younginâ thuggin he bustinâ if you eva playinâ frog
Me and four fifth wer brothers felt like we done it all
Then one day in the studio was when I got da call
Man it was 09 when I lost my dawg
And still ta dis day da tears continue ta fall
I love my nigga see da pain still remains
Kno you watchin from heaven how far dat ya nigga came 
So I tatted ya name to show you I neva changed 
Progress da aim tha bond still remains my nigga

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Donât give ah damn about the law
Ima push my luck
Gotta ah few haters
So the two longs tough
Got ah small circle
All we has is trust
Me and my dawgs
And all we got is us
Pour ah lil liquior
Forget about the pain
Lotta niggas in the dirt
So the sky is where we aim
Now we got the money da power and the fame
Lotts shit done changed 
Now we riding down memory lane
Its jus me and my dawgs
And we riding down memory lane
Down memory lane
We in dat all white range
Its jus me and my niggas 
And we ridin down memory lane
Down memory lane 
We ridin down memory lane

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Chea, and I jus gotta keep it real I'm tellinâ ya how I feel 
Talkin before da deal when I was back in da field
Memba we use ta chill its ree and my nigga Dale
He attendin da school ah student at fullsail
We visited in his crib ah couple days and we bail
Hit ah couple of clubs den ah couple ah girl 
got damn my nigga then da muthafuckin days
lord jus tell me why you had to take my dawg
they jus wanted his car they jus wanted to ball
he jus wanted to leave frighten by what he saw
I was off in da room waitin on my nigga call
Not knowin dats the last time we would even talk
I toldâem to be safe and send da deuces to my dawg
Ah couple hours lata gotta unexpected call
My homie he was cryin I knew dat it was bad
He told me dale gone ya lyin out ya ass
I called his cell phone but nobody hit me back
Day say he was shot dyin to make it out 
He died on the scene dats when I hit my knees
Beggin the lord please heavenly father please
Turn dis into ah dream tel me how dis could be
Probably cause of me I'm who he wanted to see
Man ah couple years ago is when I lost my dawg
And still ta dis day da tears continue ta fall
I love my nigga see da pain still remains
Kno you watchin from heaven how far dat ya nigga came 
So I tatted ya name to show you I neva changed 
Put dat shit on my chain our bond is like ah stain my nigga

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Donât give ah damn about the law
Ima push my luck
Gotta ah few haters
So the two longs tough
Got ah small circle
All we has is trust
Me and my dawgs
And all we got is us
Pour ah lil liquior
Forget about the pain
Lotta niggas in the dirt
So the sky is where we aim
Now we got the money da power and the fame
Lotts shit done changed 
Now we riding down memory lane
Its jus me and my dawgs
And we riding down memory lane
Down memory lane
We in dat all white range
Its jus me and my niggas 
And we ridin down memory lane
Down memory lane 
now we slidin down memory lane

Gone but never forgotten RIP to all the ones we lost
