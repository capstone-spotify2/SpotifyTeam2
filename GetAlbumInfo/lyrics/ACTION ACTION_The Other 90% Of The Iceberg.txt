Take the needle out, enjoy the drip.
Fill your head with lies, from your fingertips.
And you can't swallow all your problems, they float, float up to hunt you.
It's time for you to choose your conscience or the chemicals.
Caught in a dream disguise; happiness is real.
A snake, the knife, the candle, hold what's close to us.
A cave, that box, a tunnel, is our trust a must?
Our irrational manifestations, please decode the dosage.
Do we dream to solve the puzzle or dream to make them up?
Be careful what you wish for...
