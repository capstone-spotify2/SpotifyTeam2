How long it will take you to reach the stars? 
No <i>[?]</i> from where you are 
No one could escape it, and hold it right 
No had no companion, and you were right 
It's you that I want, it's you the star 
No one for the taking, it will be mine 
No <i>[?]</i> seven stars, seven stars. 

Twenty seconds in counting, fifteen seconds, 
Twelve, eleven, ten, eight mission sequence stars 
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. 

<i>[?]</i> from where you are 
To know where you're going, the seven stars, 
The seven stars, seven, and seven more
