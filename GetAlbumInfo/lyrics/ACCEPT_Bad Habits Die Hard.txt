One step forward - two steps back
Living on the edge - it's as simple as that
I'm no Mr. Lucky - I've never been close
I'm higher than some - but I'm lower than most

Just when you thought that you'd got it made
The bitch draws blood again
You sow as you reap - the same mistakes
Buddy rings the bell - begin the same

Bad habits - bad habits die hard
Bad habits - bad habits die hard

I'm stuck in a rut - but I'm burning inside
I am what I am - just a low-down bum
Always end up in trouble - just trying to be good
But with tumbling dice - the sixes will come

Bad habits - bad habits die hard
I know I got a lot of bad habits - bad habits die hard
I bet you got 'em too

One step forward - two steps back
I get caught in the middle - nailed to the rack
Got a load of bad habits - corrupted within
I'm a freak of nature - full of vices and sins

Just when you thought that you'd got it made
The bitch draws blood again
You sow as you reap - the same mistakes
Buddy rings the bell - begin the game

Bad habits - bad habits die hard
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
I know I got a lot of bad habits - bad habits die hard
Everybody's got bad habits - bad habits die hard
