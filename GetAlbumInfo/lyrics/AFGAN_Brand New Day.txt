I open my eyes 
And suddenly feel your love wash over me
Let go of the past 
It's time to move on now that I'm finally free 

I wasted so much time 
Caught up in the wilderness, yeah
But now I understand 
The love I have is all I need to take me to a better place 
It feel like

My heart is beating 
It's more that a feeling 
I'm ready to make it through 
I know your love is so true 
Fire is burning 
And the wheels they keep turning 
Taking me closer to you 
Seems like the day is brand new 

Let me just say 
That I'm so grateful for the highs and lows 
And every day 
I promise I'll take the chance to let you know 

It's easy to believe, 
That someone's watching over me 
I know I'll be alright 
The love I have is all I need to take me to a better place 
It feel like

My heart is beating 
It's more that a feeling 
I'm ready to make it through
I know your love is so true 
Fire is burning 
And the wheels they keep turning 
Taking me closer to you 
Seems like the day is brand new 

I'm ready to make it through 
I know your love is so true 
I'm ready to make it through 
I know your love is so true 

An even if the darker skies reappear 
Cos I know I will stand strong 
No need to worry, cos I know you'll be here 
To guide me it feels like

My heart is beating 
It's more that a feeling 
I'm ready to make it through 
I know your love is so true 
Fire is burning 
And the wheels they keep turning 
Taking me closer to you 
Seems like the day is brand new 

My heart is beating 
It's more that a feeling 
I'm ready to make it through 
I know your love is so true 
Fire is burning 
And the wheels they keep turning 
Taking me closer to you 
Seems like the day is brand new
