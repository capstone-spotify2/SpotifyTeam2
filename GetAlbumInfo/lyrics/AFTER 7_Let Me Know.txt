People run around talking trash about
Tryina out you down, but they don't know that I'm crazy
Bout you
They say that you're the type of girl
That gets around, couple drinks and
Baby, you put out well
Maybe, maybe that's true
Well, I don't hear what they'd be saying in them streets
The only thing that matters to me

Long as you let me know
I don't care what they know
As long as we talk about it
Be about it, I know that we can work it out
Nothing gonna come between us
If you just let me know
Oh oh ooh uuh
Oh, baby baby baby
Listen girl

Baby, let them talk about it
The way we used to hang around and do crazy
Oh, you used to do
They can tryina dig up all the dirt they want
But baby I don't give a damn
Because baby I know that ain't you
Well, I don't hear what they'd be saying in them streets
The only thing that matters to me

Long as you let me know
I don't care what they know
As long as we talk about it
Be about it, I know that we can work it out
Nothing gonna come between us
If you just let me know

Long as we got love between us
I don't care what they say about us
Talk about it, be about it
I know there's a way that we can work around it
'Cause all that really matters is our love

Long as you let me know
I don't care what they know
As long as we talk about it
Be about it, I know that we can work it out
Nothing gonna come between us
If you just let me know

Long as you let me know
I don't care what they know
As long as we talk about it
Be about it, I know that we can work it out
Nothing gonna come between us
If you just let me know
