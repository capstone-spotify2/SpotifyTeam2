Flattop guitar
Down around the campfire
You can smell that hickory burnin'
Catfish fryin'
Onions got us cryin'
Hush puppies they're a turnin'
Friends and kin comin' down the hill
Trippin' in the ole starlight
Cookin' and kickin' do a little pickin'
Party tonight

Come on down to the Moonlight Lounge
Where the ceilin' is so blue
Where there ain't no door and our dance floor
Is covered with mountain dew
Where there ain't no walls and the waterfall
Is the only sound around
Yeah, we're havin' us a party down in the holler
We call it the Moonlight Lounge

Me and my lady rode in on Sadie
A fourteen hand chestnut mare
A midnight hoot owl, he's screechin' so loud
Kind of puts a chill in the summer air
The bushes are wigglin', somebody's gigglin'
Buck couldn't wait to get a kiss
Jimmy's got the four wheel hooked to the wagon
A hay ride you don't wanna miss

Come on down to the Moonlight Lounge
Where the ceilin' is so blue
Where there ain't no door and our dance floor
Is covered with mountain dew
Where there ain't no walls and the waterfall
Is the only sound around
Yeah, we're havin' us a party down in the holler
We call it the Moonlight Lounge

Won't you come on down to the Moonlight Lounge
Where the ceilin' is so blue
Where there ain't no door and our dance floor
Is covered with mountain dew
Where there ain't no walls and the waterfall
Is the only sound around
Yeah, we're havin' us a party down in the holler
Call it the Moonlight Lounge

Yeah, we're havin' us a party everybody holler
Down at the Moonlight Lounge...
