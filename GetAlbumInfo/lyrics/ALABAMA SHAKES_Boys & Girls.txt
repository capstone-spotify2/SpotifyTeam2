Oh why can't we be
Best friends anymore?
They say a friend
Ain't to be
Between a girl and a boy
I don't know who said it
Or why it got to be so wrong

Oh why don't you call
Don't you care anymore
It's not fair
Don't let 'em get you
It took us both and now I got to fix you
Well I don't know how to fix you
You say it's just the way it's got to be, but how so?

Why
Is an awful lot of question
And I can't give me no answer
I keep wondering on

Oh why can't you see
That I'm not trying to be
No kind of bother
I'm just trying to save what was left between you and me
And where we left it before they took it
And took it all
And took off

Oh why did I let them drive a wedge between
Well I watched it, and I didn't say nothing
And now I'm crying when I sleep
Now I'm sayin', I'm prayin', to that sweet melody in my soul

Why
Is an awful lot of question
And I can't give me no answer
I keep wondering on

I wanna know, who said it
Well who said that, oh Lord
