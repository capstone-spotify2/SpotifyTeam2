A big moon is risin'
So bright in the sky
But it won't shine brighter
Than the stars in your eyes

It rises above me
So bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone
As lovely as you

Take me into the night
Pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
I love you
More than I can show you
More than I can know in my heart

So lay down beside me
And hold me tonight
For your love has found me
And it feels so right

These thoughts in my mind
Are so scattered and few
But I won't see anyone
As lovely as you

Take me into the night
Pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
I love you
More than I can show you
More than I can know in my heart
In my heart
