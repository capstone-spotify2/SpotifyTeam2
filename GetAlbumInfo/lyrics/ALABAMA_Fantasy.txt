Fantasy, midnight and you and me
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free
Take me away, away.

Outside on a blanket in the moonlight
It feels right with my arms around you tight
Laying under heaven watching stars play
While me and you and mother nature drift away.

Fantasy, midnight and you and me
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free
Take me away, away.

Fantasy, midnight and you and me
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.

Fantasy, midnight and you and me
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.
Take me away, away.
Take me away, away.
Take me away, away...
