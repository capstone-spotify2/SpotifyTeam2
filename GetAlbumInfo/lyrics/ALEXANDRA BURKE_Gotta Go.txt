You said you'd never break my heart
And we'll never be apart
So seeing you after so long
Got me spinning round, round, round, round

You said we'd always be together
And to me you were so precious
So after you what happens now?
You got me feeling down, down, down, down

So I think I gotta go 'cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again, so I'm thinking, thinking
I think I gotta go before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more so I think I gotta go

Seeing you after so long
Feels so strange 'cause the feelings ain't gone
Like a roller coaster ride
Got me spinning round, round, round, round

So I think I gotta go 'cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again, so I'm thinking, thinking
I think I gotta go before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more, so I think I gotta go

You see the damage has been done
And now I know you're not the one
Because my heart just wants to run and run and run and run

So I think I gotta go before I start to catch a feeling
You might end up leaving again, so I'm thinking, thinking

So I think I gotta go 'cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again, so I'm thinking, thinking
I think I gotta go before I start to catch a feeling
And you might end up leaving like you left me once before
My heart can't take no more

So I think I gotta go 'cause seeing you is so confusing
And I might end up losing again, so I'm thinking, thinking
I think I gotta go before I start to catch a feeling
