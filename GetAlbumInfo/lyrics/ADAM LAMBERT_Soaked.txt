Soaked to the bone
And sink like a stone
Walk home alone
It's not the first time
It's not the worst crime
Your soul will be OK

And you've had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Burned by your dreams
It's never how it seems
Cold crushed esteem
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be OK

And you've had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

And you've had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
I will take you home
It's not the first time
It's not the worst crime
Our souls will be OK
