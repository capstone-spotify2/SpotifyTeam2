I remember when you told me 
That I got you in a heartbeat baby 
And you couldn't be without me 
Even if we didn't go steady 
How I tried to keep a straight face 
When you took me back to your place 
And I kinda had you waiting 
Anticipating for the rating 

But I have to let you know 
That you had me at hello 

Now I'm forever yours 
We walk through open doors 
And 'til the end of time 
Our stars align and shine 
Forever yours 
I give you all and more 
And baby if we go, we go together 
I will always be forever yours 

There's a bond between us 
I'm in need of that we feed off baby 
And all the good and bad times 
Only refines what we have together 
And if you need a confirmation 
About the state of our relation 

Then I have to let you know 
That my heart is not letting go 

Now I'm forever yours 
We walk through open doors 
And 'til the end of time 
Our stars align and shine 
Forever yours 
I give you all and more 
And baby if we go, we go together 
I will always be forever yours 

When night turns to day 
When clouds block the sun 
I will wash them away 
I'm yours, and you're always mine 
Whatever will be, will be fine 
'Cos now I'm 

Now I'm forever yours 
We walk through open doors 
And 'til the end of time 
Our stars align and shine 
Forever yours 
I give you all and more 
And baby if we go, we go together 
I will always be forever yours
