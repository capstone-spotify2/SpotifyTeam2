When I feel you right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me

Shivers down my backbone
Shakes in the knee bones
Quivers down my thigh bones
And I'm shakin' all over

I went to the doctor the other day
I'm about to tell you what the man had to say about love, said

Shivers down my backbone
Shakes in the knee bones
Quivers down my thigh bones
And I'm shakin' all over, now

I went to the doctor the other day
I'm about to tell you what the man had to say about love, he said

Shivers down my backbone
Shakes in the knee bones
Quivers down my thigh bones
And I'm shakin' all over, now
