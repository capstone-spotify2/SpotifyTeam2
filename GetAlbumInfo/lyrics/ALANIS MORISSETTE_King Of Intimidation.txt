"The women of this family seem to feel that they owe it to the men of the family to look relaxed, rested, and attractive at dinner time"

For you they live in a quiet monastery.
For you they wear whatever you want them to as long as it is short
They count to ten when you tell them how to drive and
When they're afraid they let you speak for them

All hail the king of intimidation;
Model of good Christian behavior

For you we wax, nostalgic-ened our legs.
For you we chew our nails if we had any left buy fake ones to do it
We counted to ten temporarily and it was
Something about how you talk down to me

All hail the king of intimidation;
Model of good Christian behavior

The room of compromise is full and apparently you don't want some
Theres only so much we can do to make your rest assured

I am single
I am weary
You're just jealous
You're just confused
Your just hungry
You're missing out
You're not healthy
You I pity

All hail the king of intimidation;
Model of Christian behavior
And he knows not of what he has wrongly done
So forgive his ignorant behavior

You are tortured
You are captured
You were busted
We were silent
You were tested
You knew better
You are lonely
Was it worth it?
