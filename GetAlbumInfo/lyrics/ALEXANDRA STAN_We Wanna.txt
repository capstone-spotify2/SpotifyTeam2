We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low,
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance,
It's about to go!
It's about to go! Hey!
'Bout to go! Hey!
It's about to go!

Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic going around
I get the fever when I hear that song,
I can't help it, I gotta move right now!
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away, eh eh
I wanna party like everyday, eh eh
If you're with me let me hear you say!

Do we wanna stop it? No way!
Do we let the cops in? No way!
We about to rock this whole place
What do we want?!

We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low,
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance,
It's about to go!
It's about to go! Hey!
'Bout to go! Hey!
It's about to go! Hey!
'Bout to go! Hey!
It's about to go!

They call me Afro baby
I see you be looking, daddy come get it
I'm with it, I'm ready
You better get busy
So city to city the girls so spinnin' down down down down
Say 1, 2, 3 to the 4
Mami, relax, like you're tryina make it on the toll,
But you're the one that got meon the trippin'
The girls on my hands, when really like it on the hips
Perdona, la drama se ve potencial
El maximo lider del party mundial
High up on your like we're end it
Stop like you know I'm abandoned

Hey!
'Bout to go! Hey!
We wanna,
Hey!
'Bout to go!
