<i>[Verse 1: Aaliyah]</i>
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me (What would she do?)
And if your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me, why you wanna play me?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, can't fade me
Try to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you (To get wit' you)
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, can't fade me
Try to persuade me, and if she only knew (If she only knew)

<i>[Verse 2: Aaliyah]</i>
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you, and
If your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
Why you wanna play me?

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Missy]</i>
Ooooh, if you a chicken head, ba-ba-ba-baw
All up in my grill like ill
'Cause I wear Nikes and do not wear Brigettes
I skee over in my lex and see you drive by in your chevettes
I burn baby, burn, burn
Every time I twist my hips, I see your boyfriend turn, turn
Is it your concern, to teach you not to look boo
What would she do if she knew?

<i>[Bridge: Aaliyah (Missy)]</i>
If your girl only knew (Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee Haw, hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Hee Hee Hee Hee Haw, hit me on my car phone)

If your girl only knew (Hee, Hee Hee, hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew, knew, knew (Hee Haw, hit me on my car phone)

<i>[Verse 4: Missy]</i>
Oooh na, na na, goo goo, gaa gaa
Tell ya Mama and ya Papa to chuckle wit laughter
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
Beef... you don't wanna tassle wit the master of funk bump
Tell 'em what you won't... Don't touch me, M-I- crooked letters- Y
Bump back, hump back jump back, die!
Fool!, I - I sigh, wave bye-bye to ya peoples now
Hit you wit this track from the leaders now
Me and Tim, and Aaliyah now,
We gon' get down like a hound..., We gon' get down like a hound...
We gon' get down like a hound..., We gon' get down like a hound...
How you like me now?

<i>[Break (Timbaland)]</i>
What? One time for their minds
Uh uh, babygirl, babygirl
One time for their minds, uh
Babygirl, can you hear me with the switch?

<i>[Aaliyah Acapella:]</i>
Why you wanna play me? Don't play me
You can't fade me, can't fade me
Try to persuade me, and if she only knew..

<i>[Timbaland]</i> Uh, drum change

Try to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you

<i>[Timbaland ad lib]</i>

<i>[Aaliyah:]</i>

You can't fade me, can't fade me
Try to persuade me, and if she only knew (If she only knew)
Why you wanna play me? Don't play me (Ooh, baby, babe)
You can't fade me, can't fade me
Try to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you (to get wit' you, oooh)
Why you wanna play me? Don't play me (Why you wanna play?)
You can't fade me (Baby you can't fade) Can't fade me
Try to persuade me, and if she only knew
Why you wanna play me? Don't play me

Try to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you
