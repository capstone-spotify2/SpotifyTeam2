Just you know why 
Why you and I 
Will by and by
Know true love ways 
Sometimes we'll sigh 
Sometimes we'll cry 
And you'll know why 
Just you and I 
Know true love ways

Throughout the days 
Our true love ways 
will bring us joys to share 
with those who really care 

Sometimes we'll sigh 
Sometimes we'll cry 
And we'll know why 
Just you and I 
Know true love ways

Throughout the days 
Our true love ways 
will bring us joys to share 
with those who really care 

Sometimes we'll sigh 
Sometimes we'll cry 
And we'll know why 
Just you and I 
Know true love ways
Know true love ways
