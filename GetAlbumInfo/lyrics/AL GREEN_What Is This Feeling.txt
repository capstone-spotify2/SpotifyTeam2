What is this feelin' I have in my heart for you? 
Ah , baby , oh baby
Is one of the things I can't explain to you
And that's how I feel about you

You kissin' me a thousand times
Slowly drivin' me out of my mind, oh no baby, yeah
I'm really crazy 'bout the way you can be, my baby, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, ooh baby, oh yeah

You go out late at night, that you do
Knowin' thing with me and you ain't right, no

My love, love, love, my love, love
Baby, baby somebody need to help me now, yeah
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, baby, say yeah

I'm yours, I'm yours, baby, yeah

Crazy 'bout the way you can be, yes I am
Hey baby, hey baby, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, baby, yeah

To put me on my feet, baby

Hey, let's come on into your love, baby
Oh ho, all you got to do hold me tender, love me long
Hey baby, yeah I wanna know, I got to know
