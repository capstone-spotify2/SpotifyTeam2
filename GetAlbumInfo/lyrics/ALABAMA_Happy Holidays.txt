Smilin' faces on city streets,
Crowded shoppers, busy feet
And every smile just seems to say,
We're having some Happy Holidays

Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees,
Kids up on Santa's knew
Busy lines on telephones,
Sending a Merry Christmas home

Bells ringing everywhere,
Season spirit in the air
Up and down the avenue,
Holiday dreams comin' true

A choir singing songs of cheer,
Carols we all love to hear
Rudolph with his glowin' nose,
Lovers under mistletoe

Postman bringin' Christmas cards,
Reindeer out in the yard
Frosty with his eyes of coal,
Presents wrapped in pretty bows

Sidewalks full of happy eyes,
Flakes fallin' from the sky
Boys and girls at the big parade
To see St. Nick up on his sleigh

The scene is set, it's beautiful,
Sounds of Peace, Joy and Love
From all of us we'd like to say,
Have yourself some Happy Holidays...
