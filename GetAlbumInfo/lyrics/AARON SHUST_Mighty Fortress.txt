He won't abandon, He won't deceive
He won't desert us, He won't ever leave
He'll never forsake us, He will never run
He'll never reject us, The faithful one

Your love will remain, your love will remain

A mighty fortress is our God
A tower of strength never failing
The name of Jesus true and strong
No other power could ever save us
You are good, You are good
Mighty fortress, mighty fortress

You won't abandon, You won't deceive
You won't desert us, You won't ever leave
You'll never forsake us, You will never run
You'll never reject us, The faithful one

Yesterday and today
And forever Your love will remain
Nothing has the power to sever Your love
You are good, You are good
And Your mercy endures
You are good, You are good

And You won't abandon (A mighty fortress is our God)
You won't deceive (A tower of strength never failing)
'Cause You won't desert us (The name of Jesus true and strong)
You won't ever leave (No other power could ever save us)
