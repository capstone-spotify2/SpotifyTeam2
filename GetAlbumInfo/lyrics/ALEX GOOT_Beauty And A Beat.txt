Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off (eh, eh, eh)
What you got, a billion couldâve never bought (eh, eh, eh)

Weâre gonna party like itâs 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, weâre young tonight
Iâm coming for ya, Iâm coming for ya

Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
Itâs all about you,
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

Yeah

Body rock, I wanna see your body rock (eh, eh, eh)
Take a bow, youâre on the hottest ticket now, oh (eh, eh, eh)

Weâre gonna party like itâs 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, weâre young tonight
Iâm coming for ya, Iâm coming for ya

Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
Itâs all about you,
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

Body rock, I wanna see your body rock
Body rock, I wanna see your body rock

Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
Itâs all about you,
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
