I can't feel nothing at all...

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
Drug market, sub-market, 
Sometimes I wonder why I ever got in.  
Blood market, love market, 
Sometimes I wonder why they need me at all.
Zydrate comes in a little glass vial.

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
A little glass vial?

<i>[Support group:]</i>
A little glass vial.

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery.

<i>[Support group:]</i>
Hhh-hhh...

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And the zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy.

<i>[Support group:]</i>
Hhh-hhh...

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And when the gun goes off, it sparks 
And you're ready for surgery!

<i>[Support group:]</i>
Surgery!

<i>[Amber:]</i>
Graverobber, graverobber, 
Sometimes I wonder why I even bother.  
Graverobber, graverobber, 
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all!

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And amber sweet is addicted to the knife.

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
Addicted to the knife?

<i>[Support group:]</i>
Addicted to the knife.

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And addicted to the knife, 
She needs a little help with the agony.
And a little help comes in a little glass vial 
In a gun pressed against her anatomy. 
And when the gun goes off, 
Ms. sweet is ready for surgery.

<i>[Graverobber and support group:]</i>
Surgery!

<i>[Amber:]</i>
Graverobber, graverobber, 
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all...

<i>[Support group:]</i>
It's clean, it's clear, it's pure-- 

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
It's what?

<i>[Support group:]</i>
It's rare.

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
It takes you there.

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
It what?

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
It takes you there.

<i>[Amber:]</i>
It takes you there.

<i>[Genterns:]</i>
A little jump.

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
Before the cut!

<i>[Genterns:]</i>
Why agonize?

<i>[Genterns:]</i>
Anesthetize!

<i>[Amber:]</i>
I can't feel nothing at all!

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
'cause surgery...

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
'cause surgery...?

<i>[Amber:]</i>
'cause surgery...

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
Is what she needs...

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
Is what I need...?

<i>[Amber:]</i>
It's what I need.

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
To change inside.

<i>[Shilo:]</i>
To change inside?

<i>[Amber and support group:]</i>
To feel alive!

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
Mag's contract's got some mighty fine print.

<i>[Support group:]</i>
Some mighty...fine...print...

<i>[Graverobber:]</i>
And that mighty fine print puts mag in a mighty fine predicament...
If mag up and splits, her eyes are forfeit
And if geneco and rotti so will it,
Then a repo man will come 
And she'll pay for that surgery, surgery!

<i>[Graverobber and support group:]</i>
Surgery, surgery!

<i>[Amber and support group:]</i>
I can't feel nothing at all...
