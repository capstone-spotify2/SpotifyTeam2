Itâs harder to admit youâre wrong
When youâve known it was the truth all along?
You make it seem like youâre dying somehow
I believe you and suddenly Iâm scared

You know its been a couple weeks now
You know you really better lay down
âcause you donât wanna get sick again

When its hard to breathe
You feel your body tingling
Do your best to just stay sane
Stay right by her side
And never let her close her eyes
You want her to remain within her mind
Sheâs got dementia

Sheâs sticking by her made up story
Thatâll never happen to me
Cars will only crash occasionally
Its a game of odds you see
Every one in a million
There is something that will make you look again
Iâll be the end of you

You know its been a couple weeks now
You know you really better lay down
Cause you donât wanna get sick again

When its hard to breathe
You feel your body tingling
Do your best to just stay sane
Stay right by her side
And never let her close her eyes
You want her to remain within her mind
Sheâs got dementia

So take a moment to step aside
And realize whats wrong
These things youâll have to make it through
Theyâre going to be hard for you

When its hard to breathe
You feel your body tingling
Do your best to just stay sane
Stay right by her side
And never let her close her eyes
You want her to remain within her mind
Sheâs got dementia
