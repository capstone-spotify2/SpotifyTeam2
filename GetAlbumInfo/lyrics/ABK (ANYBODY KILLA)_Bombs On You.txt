Tell me what the fuck's goin' on ya'll?? 
We're droppin' bombs up in this bitch!! 
Tell me what's goin' on!? 
Ya'll better recognize 
Psychopathic 
DROPPIN' BOMBS!!! 

I will always keep my shit, underneath the surface 
Because the way I flow, the mainstream don't deserve this 
I'm set out to break backs on tracks, 
and scratch on all records that you spin on wax 
I'm a crazy motherfucker with pride 
And I got enough wisdom to keep my soul alive 
So grab a mic and lemme see if it shine 
Cause it's time to make this whole world mine, all mine 
Everytime I see these people 
They always just stop and stare 
Like I don't belong in this place 
So they say that it's not fair 
I can't understand this drama 
That the earth brings down on me 
So let me take you through my mind 
Look in my eyes, follow me 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Tell me 
What's going on 
and drop these bombs on you 

I'm gonna tell you why I'm droppin' bombs 
Because I'm sick and fuckin' tired of seeing fire alarms 
Little explosions, marshmallows roasting 
Soft motherfuckers standing on the stage boasting 
Now don't expect me to just walk away 
Because I've been told ya'll that I'm here to stay 
I'ma still keep flowing, from coast to coast 
And I'ma still keep smoking weed with juggalos 
I'ma still bust caps, at all these hoes 
And I'mma drop me a bomb off, at every show 
That's how it is, so just grab your bow 
Because it's time to represent 
and watch these warriors grow 
I can't understand this drama 
That the Earth brings down on me 
So let me take you through my mind 
Look in my eyes, follow me 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Tell me 
What's going on 
and drop these bombs on you
