Just a minute's silence
One moment of silence
These days you gotta get it
Oh, it is a splendid thing 

Did you ever feel like
Like it was all just comin' down?
Did you ever feel like
Like it was all just comin' down?
Ohh, you got a right smile, there
Ohh, you got a right smile, there
And that alone 
It will shake us to the ground 

Shake your hips, now (move it now)
Shake your hips, now (you feel it)
Shake your hips, now (move your tongue and)
Shake your hips (shake it all now, move on)
Shake your hips (shake it all now)
Shake your hips (move it over)

8-0 tight, 9-0 loose
8-0 tight, 9-0 loose
Heaven's just a block away
Heaven's just a block away
You know it just ain't right 
9-0 loose 

Shake your hips, now (move it now)
Shake your hips, now (you feel it)
Quit the slick, now (move your tongue and)
Get the flip, now(shake it all now, move on)
Shake your hips, now (shake it all now)
Quit the slick, now (move it over)
Shake your hips, now

It's so tight
That you wish that it was loose
It's so tight
That you wish that it was loose
I was just a block away!
I was just a block away!
It just ain't right, so break loose 

Looking for the right line
Cannot find the right line (right line to my soul)
Words are falling, can you see the rain
The right line to my soul (the right line to my soul)

Shake your hips, now (move it now)
Shake your hips, now (you feel it)
Quit the slick, now (move your tongue and)
Get the hip, now (shake it all now, move on)
Get the flip, now (shake it all now)
Shake your hips, now (move on)
Quit the slick, now (shake it all now)
Shake your hips, now (move it over)
Shake it 

Shake your hips, now (move it now)
Shake your hips, now (you feel it)
Quit the slick, now (move your tongue and)
Get the hip, now (shake it all now, move on)
Get the flip, now (shake it all now)
Shake your hips, now (move on)
Quit the slick, now (shake it all now)
Shake your hips, now (move it over)
