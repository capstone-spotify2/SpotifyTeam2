It's Christmas again, December is here
Hasn't it been a wonderful year?
For the plans you're making, all the time you're taking
Greet the next one with good cheer
Won't you dear, as you ring the chime
Just because its Christmastime
And on the tree all the ornaments glow
Tinsel will cover where the branches don't grow
There's lights on all the houses
Spouses with their spouses
Children playing in the snow
One in the swing and one upon the horse
Keeping on tracks another matter of course
Thats the great divisor you are now the wiser
Maybe just a bit less so
Touch and go til you stop on a dime
All alone at Christmastime

Its Christmas again, December is here
What did you wish for what did you fear
Look at your behaviour looking for a saviour
Underneath the mistletoe
You should know that it is less a crime
To be all alone at Christmastime
Christmastime
