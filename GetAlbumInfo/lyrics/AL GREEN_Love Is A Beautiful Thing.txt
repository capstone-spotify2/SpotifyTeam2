This is what I believe..

Been so long since I met you
And all the changes we've been through
And all this time I can't forget you
Everywhere I turn I think of you
And I..I wanna love ya baby
And you-ooh, you are all I need

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Maybe it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

Love is such a sweet emotion
I want to share it all with you
Your trust and..endless devotion
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do
Tonight..I want to thank, thank you baby
And you make my life complete

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Maybe it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

...Somebody raise your hand now (beautiful, beautiful)
...Ooooooooh I know I know I know (beautiful, beautiful)

And I, I wanna touch you baby
And you, you're all I need

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Oh I know it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

Stay together through thick and thin
Now I know I've got a friend
Cos love is a beautiful thing
Face our fears all through the years
Now I know there are no more tears
Loves is a beautiful thing

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Cos love is a beautiful thing

Ohhhhhh, you and me
Oh I know it's our destiny
Love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing
Yeahhhhh
Ohhh ohhhh
Love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful
Let's stay together
Cos I'm still in love with you
Hold me, hold me for the good times
I'm tired of being alone
Here I am
Beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful thing
Don't let nobody change your mind
It's a beautiful thing
