You want to rock and roll
It's been your big dream
You oughta celebrate
Girl! You're only sixteen
Ignore your Mom and Dad
And do what you feel
You gotta be yourself
And follow your dreams

Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Don't let them say, say that you're bad
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad

You ain't a kid no more
Adolescence behind
You're lookin' good these days
Believe me, girl!
I'm not blind
Now there's no turnin' back
Baby, you've made up your mind
It's time to stand your ground
You know that you've turned the tide

Life's too short, you gotta realize
The days go by, turn into years
Rock and Roll, its just a way of life
Its here for me, for me and you!

It's time to party now
Enjoy what we've missed
Screw everybody else
And raise up your fist

Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Don't let them say, say that you're bad
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad
