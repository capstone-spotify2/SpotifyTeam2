Your friends told me what was going on
You're feeling hurt and you're all alone
Sometimes life really gets to you, I know I know
You've been feeling like your heart's too small
That it hardly beats or not at all
Sometimes it helps to just talk, you know you know
Girl, I'll show you that you can leave it all behind

Let me take you to the ocean front
Me and you will be the only ones
We can sit and we can watch the sun go down
There's no room for a broken heart
Only room for another start
Over here in the ocean love
Can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?

We can walk hand in hand
Leave our footprints in the sand
Let the water wash them away like a second chance
Perfect view, but we're watching the pain go
<i>[?]</i> is singing somewhere over the rainbow

And I know that your heart's on fire
Let the waves kill the flames with the ocean tide
Every time it burns, we can take it back
Right here, right now
Girl, let's make a past

Let me take you to the ocean front
Me and you will be the only ones
We can sit and we can watch the sun go down
There's no room for a broken heart
Only room for another start
Over here in the ocean love
Can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?

Girl, it's just the perfect remedy
The most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Letting go of everything

Can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?

Let me take you to the ocean front
Me and you will be the only ones
We can sit and we can watch the sun go down
There's no room for a broken heart
Only room for another start
Over here in the ocean love
Can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?
Tell me, can you feel the ocean love?
Can you feel the ocean love?
