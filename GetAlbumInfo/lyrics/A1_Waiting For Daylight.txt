I miss your breathing
When sleep doesn't come
I cant help pretending you'll be home
I cant face the future
Now your in the past
Seems all of the best things never last

<i>[Chorus]</i>
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come

They say I get through this
But how could they know
How can I make it on my own
Your here in the shadow
You cover my heart
And I hear you whisper in the dark

<i>[Chorus]</i>
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come

I don't wanna let you go
But in time
But in time
I'll wake up for all I know
I'll be fine

<i>[Chorus]</i>
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
