i always wanted to be on the fucking radio
but they wouldn't play me though
whack ass corporate world dj
only play what the pencil neck geeks say play
i stopped making songs for them
i started making songs for me
whats wrond with me
i sold it on the street, they love my beat
homemade talent packed with heat
somebody put me on napster
next thing you know, im on the radio, in San Diego
howard stern gave me a spin
