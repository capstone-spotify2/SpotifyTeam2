<i>[Intro]</i>

<i>[Verse 1: Action Bronson]</i>
Live
Stare in the mirror I'm a changed man
Never, I'm just executing my game plan
Shit, I'm crunching numbers just like a rain man
And got the gray Lamb, interior was beige sand
I snap the button on the driving gloves
Pointy shoe like Aladdin on the flyin rug
I probably die from drugs or while I'm fucking
Fuck it, as long as she suck dick
You see me with a bitch like Vanna White at the benefit for battered wives
Lightly battered yam, a squeeze of lemon over lamb
Staring at the crescent while I'm laying on my back
Smokin' drug, you know the potent one
Put a half ounce of the crystal in the asshole of a shih tzu
Twist your bitch too, like Brazilian jujitsu
When I marry, cop a shower room that shits two
Sell your pussy if I called and had my chips, boo
It's Bam Bam and I'm feeling like my time is here, to take the world over
Sit A.C. Slater style on your girl's shoulder, then have a cold soda
If you ain't with me roll over

<i>[Verse 2: Retchy P]</i>
My mind marinate in drug sauce
The private driver's name is Gustaf
The cuff links is like a slut's cough
So disgusting, english muffin
With the butter at the Yiddish luncheon
With my pimpish cousin
He sport the slick-back clean
And I inquired how'd he get that
Paused and said a bitch is a bitch
I twist the spliff while I sit in the six
The classic LO sweaters sit on the prince
Thumbs in the belt loop, as I pose for the pic
My boy is shell-amen, I blessed your residence with elegance
Turning entire rooms into elephants
Stepped in the building
The doorman resemble Marcus Garvey
Ferrari taped at the party
Wheeled in by Steve Harvey
He had the freshest line in the building
He stunted on mine, it was my party
And he tarnished my shine got mad and had him escorted out
"Vincent, get 'I'm outta my face"
And Missy Elliot had started a fight
Busta Rhymes was on a molly
From afar you thought it was Kane, but it was Body
Catch a chokeslam if you try to try me
Monday night catch me wilin' at the bingo house
Just left the dog show, you know I brought Ringo out
He won a ribbon, brandished it on the side of his coat
I went outside and I was offered a smoke, I declined politely
I rock the Jordan sole that's kinda icy
My drug of choice you know is kinda pricey
Niggah
