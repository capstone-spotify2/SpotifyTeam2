Moon shine (moonshine) on the bayou
Love shrine (love shrine) break the taboo
I wanna know what's in your potion
Bound by total devotion

I was lookin' for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)

Swamp sings over the bazaar
Snake bites aligning stars
I'm enraptured there is no cure
No sanctuary from your allure

I was lookin' for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)

'Cause the voodoo that you do
Is all that you can do
To make me into your fool
'Cause when you do your voodoo
I'm just like a doll
That your pins keep pushing into

So every time I try to break this trance
I'm just so afraid I'll miss my chance
To be bewitched by the bayou

I just gotta say I want your hex
I don't wanna live without your hex
I'm so obsessed with your sexiness

Yeah...

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo
(Under your spell)
(So obsessed with your sexiness)
