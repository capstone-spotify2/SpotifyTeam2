Just wanted to make them proud
But you can't tell ups from downs
It's all alright
You can find company
In hearts that beat all in sync
We're all alright

<i>[Bridge: Abstract]</i>
We gon' be okay
We gon' be alright

<i>[Verse 1: Abstract]</i>
Musta been 2:11 when the world ended
Least it felt like it at the time
Teenage years make a heart break worse
Plus a lot was going on
Couldn't stop it at the time
Dad tried to flip the house
Funny that it all landed upside down
Known for being optimistic started feeling different
Couldn't fix it started writing lyrics all because
Nobody tried to hear it
'Round the same time
Hooked to the nicotine
Music and a smoke were synonymous to me it seemed
Paid prices, through devices
Both sides, obsessed with a vision
I know I could make mine
I knew it would take time
I knew they  would doubt shine
Thought it was just music
Didn't know that they would take sides
Freestyle at the party
They said turn it down
Sorry, was I talking over what you're gossiping about?
Small town with dreams that didn't involve skis
Lookin' at me like a weirdo, outside of the scene
Stuck to my friends not fucking with fair weather
But the maple showers brought out the May weather
Didn't know what I was doing
But I knew I couldn't stop
Wasn't slowing down even when my 4th tape dropped
Round the time I was drunk most my Freshman year
Was so focused on my craft that my grades got weird

Thought I figured out
I just wasn't made for degrees
Went home then I went back early '14
All my friends had new friends
And I lived off campus
In a dingy apartment on a twin bed mattress
Sucked but I kept my grades up for a bit
I would kick it with some homies every now and again
But the Laramie cold was keeping me inside
And I was smokin' on the green when I needed to write
Wasn't able to sleep or even write without it
And being alone, made my anxiety spike
If I was hanging with the group, I was drinkin' that night
Couldn't handle being out without a drink in my sight
Was a mess working on the science of feeling tall
If it wasn't for that tape, I wouldn't get up at all
Recording on a mic that was USB
Thankfully I had Craig making all of my beats
Still strugglin' tryna be heard
Still a joke back home stuck in his work
Dropped science, to dead silence
I was like, "word"
They don't get it yet, but I swear that it's gon' work
Went back home for the summer
Met up with a girl that I used to love
But I was all messed up at the time because
I couldn't deal with thinking about another end to us
She brought me back to life
Back in senior year
Couple months of that
And then she disappeared
She explained to me, and it made sense to me
That I couldn't move forward with a heart and fear
So I got distant on some bitch shit
Can't lie, I was truly being a dipshit like oh my
Knew I would move to Seattle then
Home never let me stay too long, I guess

Music wasn't makin' money
So I headed out to AI
Arts school so I thought cool Imma be fine
Family wanted a degree, cool Imma get mine
Not sure if I made the move for me at the time
I just had to get out
I was just tired of being home
Every ounce of my future was ridin' on a microphone
That's a lot of pressure
Even for a kid that's sure with no measure
To measure if my music was truly meant to deliver
Fell in love with the city
Fell back in love with my art
I was truly in the present, I learned to follow my heart
Truly independent, and finally makin' my mark
A Team Worldwide was steady lightin' a spark
100K, a couple million, then 10's
Views gone crazy, I was over the fence
I was over the moon and then Neverland dropped
That right there but I'm never gonna land off
AI wasn't really what I thought it would be
But I met a couple friends I've been happy to keep
Left that summer back home again
Then I started plotting out how the team would win
We decided that it was time that we all should meet
Overseas with the team for a couple of weeks
Patrick, Craig, Glenn, Gustav, and me
Set up in a cabin south of Stockholm streets
5 musicians, 4 countries, 1 album
Took 5 years to make this our outcome
Used to ask how come, now they ask how
I just believed in it way more than most thou
I just remained me and painted what I've seen
Painting you all the lows and highs in these dreams
All the pleasure and pain
The sun that came after rain
Now we on our way
Life will never be the...
Same

Just wanted to make them proud
But you can't tell ups from downs
It's all alright
You can find company (22 and I'm way more)
In hearts that beat all in sync (22 and I'm way more)
We're all alright (22 and I'm way more wise)

<i>[Outro: Abstract]</i>
22 and I'm way more wise to the fact
That the world makes plans that the mind can't hatch
No heart makes dreams work and time can't match
And I choose to be truth nothing rhymes like that
