Ugly people, ugly talk
Turning faces when you walk 

Leftfield leftfield so much lip
Shoot their gossip from the hip

If you need some music oh
Don't go near them gargoyles are go!

I despise the compromise oh
Talking loud and saying nothing

Ugly people ugly scene
Treat the waitresses so mean

So drunk so drunk and so bold
Not your right now, I'm getting old getting old

If you need some music oh
Don't go near them gargoyles are go

I despise the compromise oh
Talking loud and saying nothing

If you need some music oh
Don't go near them gargoyles are go-go-go-go-go
