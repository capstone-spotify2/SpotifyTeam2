Bougainvilleas fall into the pool
The hard shelled bugs bite my forearm
My right index fingernail chewed to the quick
My cervix is alarmed, scared even.

My sprinklers go off at 6 pm each day
And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors
My pimples are gooses all over my legs
My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred

And how I do love London
And how I do love London

The birds make guttural sounds and protect me
My friends come to visit and love me a lot
I don't have the energy to fill them in
I am lagged by the jet and the 12 hour flight

And how I do love London
And how I do love London

I am intrigued by the boy with the androgynous songs
Sometimes they rhyme sometimes they rhyme not
The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower
The hug will feel forced upon you inconsolable thing

And how I do love London
And how I do love London

Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still
To be loved and swallowed or single and depraved
I love speaking French to the taxi drivers
We slept and were cold on the train out of France

And how I do love London
And how I do love London
