I tried to stay on the straight and narrow 
But I've walked a crooked path 
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness 
And deservin' heaven's wrath 
Right on the money and off by a mile 
Ahead of my time and way out of style 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But I'm hangin' tough, I ain't had enough 
I ain't givin' up on life or love 

Well, I try to stay away from the bottle 
But I've reached out for the glass 
I try to pull back on the throttle 
But I still run out of gas 
I've been an angel, but never a saint 
Hung with the devil, don't nobody faint 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause I'm hangin' tough, I ain't had enough 
I ain't givin' up on life or love 

Yesterday's history, today is a chance 
Tomorrow is a mystery, so I'm makin' plans 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
To keep hangin' tough, I ain't had enough 
I ain't givin' up on life or love 
I keep hangin' tough, I ain't had enough 
I ain't givin' up on life or love, life or love...
