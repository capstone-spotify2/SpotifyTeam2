Love is a burning thing
And it makes, a firery ring
Bound by the wild desires
I fell into
A ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
Went down down down
And the flames went up higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet 
when hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, and the fire went wild

I fell intoba burning ring of fire
Went down down down
And the flames went up higher
And it burns burns burns 
The ring of fire 
The ring of fire

Oh!
Oh! 

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firery ring
Bound by your wild desires
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
Went down down down
And the flames went higher
I fell into a burning ring of fire
Went down down down
And the flames got higher
And it burns
Oh it burns 
Woah!
