You can have it all, I ain't got the heart to fight, no.
Total exhaustion, complete breakdown. For the asshole I am,
apologies in full, please leave me alone.
Pull over the van, let me out.

And we'll give the money back, to the record label.
Fire the agent, fire the manager.
We ain't got what it takes, to make it.
We got indifference, got no respect for them.
Feels like you already said so much,
feels like you can never say enough.
Let someone else take our place,
let them be your entertainment.

You know they're waiting,
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting,
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting,
(they're just waiting)
To tear us apart

You know they're waiting,
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting,
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting,
(they're just waiting.)
To tear us apart
