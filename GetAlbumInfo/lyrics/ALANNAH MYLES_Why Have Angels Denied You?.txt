In the chilly moments of a lifetime gone astray
There's a look in your eyes that I just can't explain
All my angels surround me as I sleep
Protecting me from falling in too deep

I don't know what to make of you
So I'll make believe that you love me
I don't know what to believe is true
All I wanna do is make love

Part of me is waiting for you
Part of me is free
I would show my world to you
If only you could see
Part of me is living inside you
Why have angels denied you?

I don't know what to make of you
So I'll make believe that you love me
I don't know what to believe is true
All I wanna do is make love

To you, darling to you
Part of me is living inside you
Why have angels denied you?

I don't know what to make of you
So I'll make believe that you love me
I don't know what to believe is true
All I wanna do is make love

I don't know what to make of you
So I'll make believe that you love me
I don't know what to believe is true
All I wanna do is make love, oh

I don't know what to make of you
I don't know what to believe is true, oh
I don't know what to make of you
I don't know what to believe is true
All I wanna do is make love
