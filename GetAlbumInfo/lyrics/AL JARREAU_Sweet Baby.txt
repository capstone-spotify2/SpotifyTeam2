When I think about your lovin'
The Sunday evenings, the fun we used to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over, it's only set aside

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's true, sweet baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side

Lying here alone I'm dreaming
My mind keeps wandering, my thoughts are only you
Wandering through the memories in my mind
How could love so real have turned so empty
I just keep wondering why
Will I ever find the love we shared together, you and I

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
Though we had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't u try belivin wat i say, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side
