Well Iâm just an old chunk of coal
But Iâm gonna be a diamond some day

Iâm gonna grow and glow âtil Iâm so blue, pure perfect
Iâm gonna put a smile on everybodyâs face

But Iâm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way

Iâm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But Iâm gonna be a diamond some day

Iâm gonna learn the right way to talk
Iâm gonna search and find a better way to walk

Iâm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
Until I get rid of every single flaw

Iâm gonna be the worldâs best friend
Iâm gonna go around shakinâ everybodyâs hand

Iâm gonna be the cotton-pickinâ rage of the age
Yes, Iâm gonna be a diamond some day

I said, âIâm just an old chunk of coal, my Lord
But Iâm gonna be a diamond somedayâ
