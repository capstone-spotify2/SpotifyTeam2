Little tornado
Bane of the trailer park
Lifting houses
To leave your mark

Little tornado
Noah can build his ark
But he will never
Disembark

Make it go faster
Baby, go faster
Make it go twice the speed
Of you and me

Little tornado
You and the hurricane
Close your eyes and
Go campaign

Make it go faster
Baby, go faster
Make it go twice the speed
Of you and me

Oh, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know
(We don't know, we don't know)
No, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know
(We don't know, we don't know)
No, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know

Little tornado
Blew out the windowpane
Left the inside
To the rain

Make it go faster
Baby, go faster
Make it go twice the speed
Of you and me

Oh, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know
(We don't know, we don't know)
No, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know
(We don't know, we don't know)
Oh, no, no, we don't, no, we don't know
