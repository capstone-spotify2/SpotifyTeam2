Baby! Why are you doing this to me?
Sweetheart! Are those your eyes staring straight back at me?
Angel! I see your smile everywhere!
Darling! Stop!

Night falls and I'm running in circles (Wohoo Wohoo)
I'm being chased by my imagination (Wohoo Wohoo)

Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine
Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine
No one deserves to live like this!

Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine
Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine
No one deserves to live like this!

I touch your lips and stare in your eyes
You smile and it makes me fly
You are the reason my heart beats
Tonight it's just you and me

Night as dark as my thoughts sets the scene for my return
Lightning nips at my heels as I race home
Wearily I stagger towards the song of her pale voice
Demons jeer my attempt to be free

Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine
Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine
No one deserves to live like this!

Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine
Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine
No one deserves to live like this!

I touch your lips and stare in your eyes
You smile and it makes me fly
You are the reason my heart beats
Tonight it's just you and me

Windows cast her gentle reflection
Her somber silhouette dances for me

Look at you, you miserable fool
Get off your knees, your prayers fall upon deaf ears
God's turned his back on you, Heaven's gates are shut
And now you're knocking on the devil's door

I've been expecting you for some time, sir
Allow me to introduce myself
I'm the one who pulls on all the strings, son
You're lucky I don't kill you where you stand

This can't be real
Tonight I raise my glass
There's nothing left
For I know it's time to move on

All hope has failed
My patience will not last
I've lost my soul
Tomorrow I will be gone
