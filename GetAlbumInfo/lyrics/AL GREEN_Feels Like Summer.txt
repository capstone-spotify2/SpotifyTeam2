It feels like summer
I can hear the music playin'
I hear the drummer
I can the children playin'
Snow will fall
The snow will fall
Snowfall

Sounds like laughter
A happy song in the days
What are we after?
I can hear mister say
Someone will call
Someone will call
Someone will call

Ooh

Feels like winter
Oh happy song today
In time, I can hear mister say
Snow will fall
Snow will fall, yea
Yea, the snow will fall

Snow, snow, snow, snow, will fall
Snow, snow, beautiful snow
Wonderful, cold snow
Snow

You are wonderful
Wonderful snow, snow
Beautiful, wonderful
Oh, marvelous snow, snow, yea
Meanwhile think about it
Beautiful clean wonderful snow
