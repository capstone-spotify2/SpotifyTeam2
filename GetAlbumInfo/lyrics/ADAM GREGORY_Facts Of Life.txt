Long ago my daddy spoke up
He said son I think you're old enough
so pull up a chair and sit down here with me

I thought I knew what was coming next
Mysteries of the opposite sex
boys and girls and birds and bees

A father son conversation
A little heart to heart advice
He said it's time you learned the facts of life

You better shoot straight and have faith
that your prayers are heard
And when you give a handshake,
make no mistake
you're giving your word
Son you'll probably get it wrong way 
before you get it right
without the lows you don't appreciate the highs
These are the facts of life

They're called growing pains because they hurt
If you spit in the wind wear a dirty shirt
Don't try to talk when your mouth is full of food
When it's cold outside give a girl your coat
Be kind to folks that are growing old
'cause in their hearts they feel like fourteen too

And always tip your waitress
'cause she might have a child or two
Brush your teeth and always tell the truth

It don't make you weak to turn your cheek
for a man to cry
And always stand tall if you get it wrong 
boy apologize
And if you find a love that moves you
oh you better hold on tight
You might just have one chance to get it right
These are the facts of life

And I still hold on to each word he said
and I live them now

Shoot straight and have faith
that you're prayers are heard
And when you give a handshake, 
make no mistake
you're giving your word
Son you'll probably get it wrong way 
before you get it right
without the lows you don't appreciate the highs
You might just have one chance to get it right
These are the facts of life
