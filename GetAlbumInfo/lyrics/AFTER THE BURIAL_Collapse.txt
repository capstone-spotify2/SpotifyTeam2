Collapse
We fold in difficult fashion, pinions clipped and forgotten
So we grow fray and suffer the cold
Like a shiver inside our own reason
Your feigned regard a frozen lake
Iâll leave you trapped, I hope your winter never ends

Replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes
Replicated errors, and as summers melt we just
Find ourselves drowning in the flood

We melt away at the summers heat, stuck between
Our own ideas in paralyzed nights we kick and turn in searing waves
Like hollow shells, dread echoes inside
Reverberate in infinity, reverberate in infinity

Replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes
Replicated errors, and as summers melt we just find ourselves
Drowning in the flood

We smash against these glaciers of mistakes
And find ourselves drowning in the flood
Smash against these glaciers of mistakes
And find ourselves drowning in the flood
