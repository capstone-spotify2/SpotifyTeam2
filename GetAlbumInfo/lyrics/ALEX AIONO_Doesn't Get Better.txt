She's every color in the spectrum
She's the sunset in July
She's Picasso's Box of magic
The iris of an angel's eye
Yellow umbrella
A sea of New York City black
I need to tell her
She made the stars tonight burn brighter than a million suns
It doesn't get better
Get better
It doesn't get better than this
It doesn't get better than this
Shines like coral in New Zealand
Flashes like gold of a grand prize
Lit the darkness of my midnight
Blued the gray of my April skies
White hot in winter
Kiss until we're feverish
And I need to tell her
She beams she glows like lava flows
She sets the moon on fire
It doesn't get better
Get better
It doesn't get better than this
It doesn't get better than this
Blinding eyes
I'm struck like lightning
It doesn't get better
Make me feel just like I'm flying
She mades the stars tonight burn brighter than a million suns
It doesn't get better
Get better
It doesn't get better than this
It doesn't get better
It doesn't get better than this
It doesn't get better
