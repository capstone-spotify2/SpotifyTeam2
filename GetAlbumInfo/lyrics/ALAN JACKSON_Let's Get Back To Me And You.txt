I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home

But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday

Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you

It's not like it was
When we fell in love
When all we had was enough

Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Honey, let's get back to me and you

Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you

Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you

Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you

Well honey, let's get on back to me and you
