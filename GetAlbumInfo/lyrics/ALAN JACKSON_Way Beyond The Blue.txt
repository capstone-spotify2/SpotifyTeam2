I don't know, I've been told
Streets of heaven are pave with gold
I suppose its true
If heaven has anything like your love
I believe I'll be up in above a time or two
Way beyond the blue

Way beyond the blue
Way beyond the blue
I will be loving you
Way beyond the blue

If sometimes love is like a falling star
It goes so fast, and only goes so far
before it breaks your heart in two
If our love is born like an airboard jet
The higher we go, the far we're gonna get
Way beyond the blue

Way beyond the blue
Way beyond the blue
I will be loving you
Way beyond the blue

Way beyond the blue
Way beyond the blue
I will be loving you
Way beyond the blue
