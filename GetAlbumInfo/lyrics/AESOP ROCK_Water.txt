The water ain't safe, the land's made of mortar
I hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to corner
I'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer
But I rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster
Can a run-away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter 
To force the brutal truth of daily marketplace wars through the roof?
I mean, I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning
And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling
But I'm sick I've plowed these fields a thousand times over
Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quarters
And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea
I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally
Take a number, the apple seeds raineth upon your slumber
A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
My every whim acted upon has gone loopy
But I play a game called let's prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings
I split the radius of go-getter bellies, reconnaissance
Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze
Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease
Tummy full of sand running man impossible stop
There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust
Surfing the urban Ididaride, certainly flushed
Now one in the hands work to and top the toilet seater
But what lies inside my heart is off the motherfucking meter

<i>[Chorus]</i>
See the Water ain't safe no more
"I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn"
See the water ain't safe no more
"Nah nah the water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across
"The water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane can offer
"I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile"
The Water ain't safe no more..

And I've always been a 40 night chronologic hostage
Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch
Wingless Anime
I don't play in the man race cycle
Hope floater
Gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops a slot 
And potent quotas
I'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways
Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless
Now tip-toe across a lost cause
Because a lost cause found
Don't mean you found a cause
That means you found a lost cause
Ok now I've been here for role playing
Slaying my here and now
To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow
And it's incredible
Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels
But bad apples ain't sweet 
And cretins acts ain't that memorable
I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide
Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine
I wear a tiger striped ego and bilbo act my progression
Where the kindlings formulated through the flesh of the oppressors
Now, God had a flask I can prove it
You really think the 13 loops that used honor 
Spawned me a sober unit? check potion
Addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler
Adhered to the back bone, stone pusher
Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement
That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison
It's beautiful, truly beautiful
I keep a stick inside my hand
And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram

<i>[Chorus]</i>
See the Water ain't safe no more
"I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn"
See the water ain't safe no more
"Nah nah the water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across
"The water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane can offer
"I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile"
The Water ain't safe no more...
