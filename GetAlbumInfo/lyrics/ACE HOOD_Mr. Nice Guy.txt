No more mister nice guy
(You done fucked up now)
From now on, I ain't lettin' shit slide
You ain't with the clique
Wasn't with me from the get
Now these niggas wanna dick-ride
Fuck it
No more mister nice guy
Hate to introduce you all to that guy
Fuck it
No more mister nice guy

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
You lookin' at a lion in a dogfight
Shooters knock the bulb out your nightlight
Nigga, I'm the illest, that's in real life
Boy, you better chill, don't get gassed by the crowd hype
I can send a shot to make 'em act right
I suggest you go and get an ally
Know I got the heat, like I'm Pat Ri'
Beast of the South, wear the hat like a Rabbi
Nigga, I ain't impressed
Nigga, I ain't even flex
I ain't mentioned in your top five?
This the day that they regret it
Fuck 'em
Ballin' like the Rucker
Shout my nigga P <i>[?]</i> they in trouble
They ain't on my level
Big stones in the bezel
I'm a ruler with the flows, niggas can't even measure
Whatcha sayin' nigga?
I don't play games on the playground
I just go to bussin' like a Greyhound
Ain't the type of guy to <i>[?]</i> 'round
Speakin' of the South, I'm the one who hold the weight down
Who the fuck is these niggas?
Who the fuck is these niggas?
I'm kinda sick in the head
Ask H-I-V who the motherfuckin' illest

Hate to introduce you all to that guy
Fuck it
No more mister nice guy

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Fuck niggas around, I expose 'em
I am the one who the chosen
Fuck your devotion
I make 'em stir up commotion
I make 'em lock in and focus
Bitch, I'm a problem
Way too much chains on my collar
Hoes commit sin for a dollar
She just keep suckin'
Head is so good, she a scholar
Rolly on prezi Obama
I am a stoner
Pockets on Rosie O'Donnell
Loyalty's just what I honor
Out for the commas
Rap niggas don't want no drama
Just know I'm <i>[?]</i> Yolanda
Ain't no more chillin'
I got more bars than a prison
I am on point with precision
Aim at your fitted
Dope as the coke in the kitchen
Ego too big for the business
I'm disrespectful, that's just the thing I intended
Testin', I don't recommend it
Stay on my pivot
My name I dare you to mention
Flow is on fuckin' tremendous
Ya'll better warn everybody
I'm a young Vince Lombardi
Fuck you gon' teach to a coach, nigga?
I tried told niggas

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Oh! Now you fucked up!
Now you fucked up!
Now you fucked up!
You have fucked up now!
