I'm a superball
You can bounce me once and I ricochet
Around the room
I'm a superball
If I pick up speed get out of my way
I'm a sonic boom

And I warn you now
The velocity I'm gathering
Will knock you down
Send the chairs and lamps all scattering

'Cause I'm a superball
If you think there'll be no aftershocks
Well I'm a superball
Read the fine print on the back of the box
Stick to slinkies, hot wheels, alphabet blocks

And I warn you now
The velocity I'm gathering
Will knock you down
Send the chairs and lamps all scattering
