What you're gonna do
When you turn on the news
And a dictator smiles at you

What you're gonna do
When you try to escape
But big brother is watching you

What you're gonna do
When your own flesh and blood
Comes around and beats you up

What you're gonna do
When it's too much to swallow
And they still stick it down your throat

Primitive, I wanna be primitive
Primitive, let me be primitive

What you're gonna do
When it's sin after sin
and you know it's not gonna stop

What you're gonna do
When you feel all the shame
and the guilt creeping up on you

What vou're gonna do
When it's time to take a stand
and it's time for some real change

All I wanna do
Is to shed my skin
And leave it all behind

Primitive, I wanna be primitive
Primitive, let me be primitive
