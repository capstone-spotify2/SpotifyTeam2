Never thought you knew me
Never thought of you with me
Always fighting in the dark before

Never got to tell you
I don't know what I mean to you
No need to explain anymore

But I'd cry
I would die if I lost you
And I'd cry

When I think about us
It's only me that comes between us
It's only me that closes the door

But I'd cry
I would die if I lost you
And I'd cry

And you know you held me up
Held me to the sun when I was yours
And I know I let you down
Let you down the day that I was gone

But I'd cry
I would die if I lost you
And I'd cry

I'd cry
I would die if I lost you
And I'd cry
