I got it wrong I made you angry so it seems
Say Iâm a douche bag 
But I donât know what that means
Iâm in the doghouse baby please throw me a bone
You need some space but I canât bear to be alone

And I donât know how to control your temper
Just breathe in breathe out

I donât like it when you sit there quiet
Say itâs nothing but I just donât buy it
Think thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know whatâs coming
Yeah, thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot

I tried to call you like a hundred times today
Youâre so black and white
When Iâm all different shades of grey
I come around to see you but it only makes it worse
This wonât be our last fight 
And it sure hell ainât the first

I wanna hear you shout 
Let go of your temper
Just breathe in breathe out

I donât like it when you sit there quiet
Say itâs nothing but I just donât buy it
Think thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know whatâs coming
Yeah, thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot

I donât like it when you sit there quiet
Say itâs nothing but I just donât buy it
Think thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know whatâs coming
Yeah, thereâs gonna be a riot
A riot

Weâve got to make up wo oh oh
Weâve got to make up wo oh oh
Wo oh oh <i>[x4]</i>

Weâve got to make up wo oh oh
Weâve got to make up wo oh oh
Wo oh oh <i>[x4]</i>

I donât like it when you sit there quiet
Say itâs nothing but I just donât buy it
Think thereâs gonna be a riot

Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know whatâs coming
Yeah, thereâs gonna be a riot
