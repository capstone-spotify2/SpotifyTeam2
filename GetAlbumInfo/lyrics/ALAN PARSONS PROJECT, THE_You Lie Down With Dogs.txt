You're such a cool woman but I love you
Such a cruel woman but I love you
Open up your eyes and realise
You're such a fool woman but I love you
But give me all you've got to give
Cause it sure feels good to me

I'm not your only man I'm just a lover
Not your only man just another
Open up your eyes and realise
I'm gonna take what I can like any other
I'll say any damn thing that you want me to
Cause it don't mean a thing to me

Well
You lie down with dogs, you fall in with thieves
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please
You're scartchin' an itch that nothing can ease
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas

Get out and find yourself another lover
Why don't you find yourself another lover
Open up your eyes and realise
You don't mean nothing to me I'm not your mother
You gave me all that you had to give
But there's a whole lotta fish in the sea

Well
You lie down with dogs, you fall in with thieves
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please
You're scartchin' an itch that nothing can ease
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas
