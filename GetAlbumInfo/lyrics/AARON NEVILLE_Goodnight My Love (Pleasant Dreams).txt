Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
Sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.

Before you go, thereâs just one thing Iâd like to know,
Is your love still warm for me or has it gone cold?

If you should've wake in the still of the night,
Please, have no fear.
Iâll be there, you know I care
Please, give your love to me, dear, only.

Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.

If you should wake in the still of night,
Please, have no fear.
Iâll be there, you know I care
Please, give your love to me, dear, only.

Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.
