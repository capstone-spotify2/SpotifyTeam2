I get a high whenever you're around
Sweeping from my head to my toes
I gotta get my feet back on the ground 

Cuz you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line making me say what I have in mind

You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
Is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush

I got a sweet tooth and a taste for you
It might me too obvious but
I can't help my self from what I do

Cuz you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line
Making me say what I have in mind

You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
Is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush

Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much

Cuz you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line
Making my say what I have in mind

You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
Is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush 
You are my Sugar Rush

Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted

Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You are my Sugar Rush
