Their intentions come through their eyes
Not through fake smiles not through tire lies
A picture they kept safely in memory
They plague you with a jealous disease

I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone, no one to confide
Choose your side

Look around and what do you see
Look around look around now baby
Is this where you want to be

I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone no one on my side
There's no one out there in whom I can confide

Jealous tongues store you with hate
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
They either want to kiss you kill you or be you
If only they knew the struggle I've been through

Confusing what they want with what they need
Another reason to justify greed

Look around and what do you see
Look around look around now baby
Is this where you want to be

I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone no one on my side
There's no one out there in whom I can confide

I hope you burn in hell
I fucking hate you
Don't think I don't see through you
Fuck you
Look around what do you see if this where you want to be
