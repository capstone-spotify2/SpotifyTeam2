Truck stop of the border 
Deep down in Mexico 
Runnin back to California 
With a fresh cut heavy load 

White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again 

Flying in to New York City 
Bringin' the king pin piece of mind 
That allhis pawns west of liberty 
Will be well fed this June, july 

White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again 

From Colombia 
Up through Mexico 
To Atlanta 
All up and down the east coast 
From Juarez over to LA 
Houston, Miami we, got it made 

White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again 

White line fever 
White line fever 
White line straight down my vein 
White line drivin' me insane 
White line fever give it to me straight 
White line fever hit me again 
White line fever I can't get enough 
White line fever I love that stuff
