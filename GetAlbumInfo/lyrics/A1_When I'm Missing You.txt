Sunday morning time to say goodbye
But I'll be home real soon
Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry
I'll be thinkin' of you .... yeah

It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again

How can i sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you

Oh yeah, baby, oh

Now time and healin'
Another week come by
Girl it feels like years, hmmm...
I've been callin' every day and night
How i wish you were here,  ooh yeah..

It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again

How can i say when my words run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you

I never met a girl who is so this sweet
Can't wait to see you again, oh oh
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'til then

Oh, baby...

I said the time is now, baby...

How can I say when my words run dry (how can i say)
How can I smile with the tear in my eye (tear in my eye)
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you

Wooh yeah baby.. (how can i smile)
I said yeah, I said I'm missing you..(ooohh )
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June (ah)
That's how it feels (that's how it feels)
When I'm missing you
