Long hair was not in style
The first time I heard Haggard on the radio
But I could feel the changes comin' on
The Beatles crossed the ocean
An overnight explosion on the T.V.
My brother had to go to Vietnam.

Ford unveiled the Mustang
Things looked good in Detroit for the people there
And I could feel the changes comin' on
From Atlanta, Doctor King told the world he had a dream
People followed him
And Daddy said my hair was getting long.

I could feel the changes comin' on
People started singin' different songs
Searchin' for the place where they belong
I could feel changes comin' on.

Well, I'm still hooked on Haggard
But the Beatles can't come back like we hoped they would
In Memphis, Tennessee, The King is gone
As I put my kids to bed
Oh, I wonder what lies ahead for them to see
'Cause I can feel the changes comin' on.

I can feel the changes comin' on
People still are singin' different songs
They're searchin' for the place where they belong
I can feel changes comin' on.

I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.

I can feel changes comin' on
People still are singin' different songs
They're searchin' for the place where they belong.
I can feel changes comin' on.

I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
And on, and on, and on.

I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
And on, and on, and on.

I can feel, you can feel, we can feel changes comin' on.
And on, and on, and, on.
And on, and on, and on.

I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
And on, and on, and on.
And on, and on, and on.
I can feel changes comin' on.
I can feel changes comin' on...
