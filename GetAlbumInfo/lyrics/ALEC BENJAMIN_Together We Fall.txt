I know its cold
But it's not freezing
I know you're tired
But you're not sleeping
Don't close you're eyes
Cause your hearts still beating
And down, together we'll fall, together we'll fall

I know its dark, but you can see me
The air is thin, but you're still breathing
Not in your lungs, but your mind's believing
And down, together we'll fall, together we'll fall
Together we'll fall

You've been standing on your own for far too long
For too long, for too long, for too long, for too long
And you never found the faith to just move on
To move on, to move on, to move on, to move on and
Deep within your heart I see the light
Shouting to breakthrough and everything I know tells me its right
And I will fall with you

And from the night, there comes a new dawn
And from the fire, bring to life
Rise from the ashes, there's no surrender
And down, together we'll fall, together we'll fall
Together we'll fall

You've been standing on your own for far too long
For too long, for too long, for too long, for too long
And you never found the faith to just move on
To move on, to move on, to move on, to move on and
Deep within your heart I see the light
Shouting to breakthrough and everything I know tells me its right
And I will fall with you
