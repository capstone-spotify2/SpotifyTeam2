I know that I got a boo
But...
But damn I just can't stop thinking 'bout you
Don't get me wrong
'Cause I liked you long
Before he ever was there uh
Boy I was gonna make a move
'Cause I was too late
You already found yourself another date
So I moved on
But my feelings were not completely gone
Completely gone

Why
Does it have to be like this
Why
Does it have to go like this
Why
Am I stuck in this complicated situation (situation)
Why
Am I left with thoughts like this
Why
Do I have to feel this thing
Why
Can't I solve this problem
I'm twisted
I'm twisted

I know it's wrong
To love somebody else
But I just can't help myself
Oooh Oooh
Doctor help me
So what I am suppose to do
Should I just sit
Should I stand up and do something about it
Should I tell him
Or should I just lock it up inside
And try and hide it

Why
Does it have to be like this
Why
Does it have to go like this
Why
Am I stuck in this complicated situation (situation)
Why
Am I left with thoughts like this
Why
Do I have to feel this thing
Why
Can't I solve this problem
I'm twisted
I'm twisted

Why
Does it have to be like this
Why
Does it have to go like this
Why
Am I stuck in this complicated situation (situation)
Why
Am I left with thoughts like this

Can't I solve this problem
