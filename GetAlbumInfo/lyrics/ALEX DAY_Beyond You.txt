Listen, can you hear me?
Listen, now you see me
This adventure's run its course
The story's reached the end
We are both unwinding
Wonder what we'll find when
Time has taken down our walls
A new world 'round the bend

But for now I will try
To live beyond you
I'm gonna take flight
And soar beyond you
This is my time
My time to define
Myself beyond you
And I'll move onto
A day beyond you

Feelings ever-changing
I'm alive and waking
In a place I've never been
Alone and unafraid
One day I might see you
With your love beside you
We might smile or share a glance
We will be okay

But for now I will try
To live beyond you
I'm gonna take flight
And soar beyond you
This is my time
My time to define
Myself beyond you
And I'll move onto
A day beyond you

But for now I will try
To live beyond you
I'm gonna take flight
And soar beyond you
This is my time
My time to define
Myself beyond you
And I'll move onto
A day beyond you
