I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things Iâve loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If I lose myself tonight
Itâll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
Itâll be you and I
Lose myself tonight...

I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things Iâve loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
(Lose myself)
If I lose myself tonight...
