True I wasn't there for you, Told me that I hurt you deeply,
too young to know what to do, 16 and I have no worries
When I saw that picture of you, I had to find the daughter I never knew

My abscess grows, I reap what I sew, these mistakes are my own, they'll tell you're not alone

Locked behind those bars of you, wish there was a way I could help,
too young to know what to do, lessons burn the point you've proven
This love is complicated and bruised, realize what makes me makes you

My abscess grows, I reap what I sew, these mistakes are my own, they'll tell you're not alone
Time to take it slow all this anger letting go, my child I long to hold all this anger
I know I'm not a lord, I was never a saint, gotta take what you got cuz I'm nothing you ain't
If I gave you the world would you throw it away, better keep your chin up
You can abuse it, you can use it, you can go right back down that line, living life with pain
Never erase it, now you know

I'll be here your future's fading, understand what I'm explaining,
I went in anticipating, I'll b here your future's fading

My abscess grows, I reap what I sew, these mistakes are my own, they'll tell you're not alone
Time to take it slow all this anger letting go, my child I long to hold all this anger let it go

Little one can't you see I wanna let you go, don't you be like me
