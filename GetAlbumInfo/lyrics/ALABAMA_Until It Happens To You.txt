I worry all day and I can't go to sleep at night
Thinking about baby and wondering
Who's holding her tight, tonight
People say I've been a fool too long, too long
All my friends still ask me why I keep hanging on and on

And I say
You'll never know until it happens to you
You'll never know all that I'm going through
Love ain't something that flies away
Somebody goes but the feeling stays
And you'll never know until it happens to you

Saturday's rollin' and everybody's rockin' but me
I should go to town but
I don't want no company, no, no, no
Friends say I should be out having fun with someone
I know it's true but if they only knew
It's easier said than done
Oh yeah

And I say
You'll never know until it happens to you
You'll never know all that I'm going through
Love ain't something that flies away
Somebody goes but the feeling stays
And you'll never know until it happens to you

Friends say I've been a fool too long, much too long
They just don't understand
Why I sit at home all alone by the phone

And I say
You'll never know until it happens to you
You'll never know all that I'm going through
You'll never know, oh no
You'll never know, whoa
You'll never know until it happens to you...
