Hey pretty lady
How amazing you are
I just love to hear you talk
I might be crazy
When I play my guitar
Outside your window in the dark

I probably should go
Don't wanna get you in trouble
But you know I'm gonna stay
Because baby I really need to say

That I'm young and foolish
I don't know about much
But I that know this could be love
Yes I'm young and foolish
Foolish enough to know where ever you go
I'll follow you

I know you're not the type
To spend all of your time
In the mirror but look at you through my eyes
And you see the reason
Why I'm jumping inside
I'm just so exited, I'm out of my mind

I know I probably should go
Don't wanna get you in trouble
But I'm young and foolish
I don't know about much
But I know that this could be love
Yes I'm young and foolish
Foolish enough to know where ever you go
I'll follow you yeah
I'll follow you girl
I hope you don't mind
Be chased by a fool
cause girl where ever you go
I'll follow you girl...

Don't go breaking my heart
Go easy on me
I'm laying it all on the line
Yeah said I'm young and foolish
I don't know about much
But I know this could be love
Yes I'm young and foolish
Foolish enough to know where ever you go I'll follow you

I'll, I'll

I'm young and foolish,
I don't know about much
But I know this could be love
Yes I'm young and foolish
Foolish enough to know where ever you go
I'll follow you yeah
I'll follow you
I'll follow you girl
I hope you don't mind
Be chased by a fool
Cause girl where ever you go
I'll follow you girl
