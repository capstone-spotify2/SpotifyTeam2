A paper crown 
And a heart made of glass 
A tattered gown 
And a kingdom of ash 
She walks alone 
She can never look back 
The story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea 
She'll make it out 
But she's never the same 
She's looking down 
At the scars that remain
But you hold your ground 
When your kingdoms in flames
Cause it's the story of a queen 
Whose castle has fallen to the sea
Knowing there's no one who will be 
A king that will come and save his queen 

When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there's no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there's no one to love you 
When you build your walls to 
High 

She's looking out 
From the war that's inside 
She's screaming out 
Cause no one survived
But when you're all alone 
You wait and you hide 
Cause it's the story of a queen
Whose castle has fallen to the sea 
Knowing there's no one who will be 
A king that will come and save his queen 

When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there's no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there's no one to love you 
When you build your walls to 
High 

There's no one 
Who is strong enough 
To save your love 
There's no fairytale 
There's no fairytale 

When all she needs 
When all she wants 
When all she finds 
When all she is 
And ever was 
Is compromised 
Cause there's no one to love you
When you build your walls 
Too high 
And there's no one to love you 
When you trap yourself inside
