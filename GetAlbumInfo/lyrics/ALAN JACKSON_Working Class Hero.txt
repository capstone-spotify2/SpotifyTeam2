A callused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty years spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this workin' class hero
He's always been hard as a rock

But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now

'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statute carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on

That three-bedroom house
He built in the '50s
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away

What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about

'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statute carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old workin' class hero lives on

Yes, that workin' class hero lives on
That workin' class hero lives on
