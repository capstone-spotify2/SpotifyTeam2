<i>[Intro:]</i>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I seen mama make a left on main street
Had to flag her fine ass down off instinct
I'm in the Mitsubishi Mirage in dire need of a car wash indeed
She in the lil' clean Camry
I'm hoping she'll look closer than what she can see
About me, I caught her at a red light
She rolled her window down and greeted me with a smile, Sunny Delight
I'd drink a whole glass of her ass
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
That's what my conscious told me, So I said boldly:
"What's up with you and me?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and the light turned green (green, green, green)

<i>[Hook 1:]</i>
No my car ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I was tryna brush up on a honey at this kickback
Drunk throwing shots back, pretty face, ass fat (ass fat, ass fat, ass fat)
So I got behind that (behind that, behind that)
She didn't mind that
She slow whining, I'm co-signing
I said, "I hope they play Birthday Sex"
She said, "It ain't my birthday yet!"
I said, "I don't give a fuck about that"
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
And then my spoke conscious spoke free
I grabbed my Motorola Razr and said, "Lemme get your math, ma?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and pulled out her 3G
Ahhh

<i>[Hook 2:]</i>
No my phone ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

<i>[Verse 3: Not In Music Video]</i>
We had a performance at the club
I'm hype man, I figure I'd get some love
I'm off the orange juice with the Goose
Spotted a hottie on the dance floor getting loose
Approached her like, "You just my type
I had to holler before I hop on the mic"
She said, "Is that so?"
And I said, "Fo sho
I know I got shades on but I can see your glow"
I felt a connection cause baby got close
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
My conscious talked to me and laughed
So I said, "After the show you tryna come to the spot?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and said:
"You know Jay Rock? Oh..."

<i>[Hook 3:]</i>
No I ain't that dude!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Yeah I know Jay Rock, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we- yeah, yeah I'm his hype man
(Man?) Yeah, I'm his- you know what I'm saying though
Is you know... Uh, uh, yeah, Oh, I...
Have a good night
