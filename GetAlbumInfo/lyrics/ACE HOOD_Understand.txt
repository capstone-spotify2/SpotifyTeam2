No you wouldn't understand no
You wouldn't understand

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Everyday I'm in some shit that you won't understand
Like tryna take ya <i>[?]</i> But you wouldn't understand
They tryna jail my niggas up but wouldn't understand
So many sacrifices though but you wouldn't understand
You wouldn't understand, you wouldn't understand
Ya ain't get no money nigga you wouldn't understand
You wouldn't understand, you wouldn't understand
My bitch so expensive trust me you wouldn't understand
(na na na na)
You wouldn't understand
(na na na na)
You wouldn't understand
Everyday i'm in some shit that you won't understand
Like tryna take ya <i>[?]</i> But you wouldn't understand
(na na na na)

Devil on my shoulder, <i>[?crouches on my chest?]</i>
Smokin' hella kush that's how I deal with all this stress
Lawyer on my line, BM on the text
Pocket watchin tryna go <i>[?]</i>
I'm not happy with my label but they don't understand
I deserve much better is that too much to demand?
I'm so sick of them excuses, feel like i'm bout to lose it
I'm sorry to my fans there's so much shit behind the music
Got my patience runnin too thin, I'm just on some new shit
Had to relocate got inspiration on the west end
I learn from every lesson, thankful for every blessing
Mamma told pray and keep it real since adolescence lord!

Everyday's a hustle, everyday a struggle
Granny in the grave, mama can't recover
Tryna please everybody, that just makes a nigga wonder
Would they every do the same
Keep it a hunnid I ain't neva give a fuck
Nigga i'ma do me, give a damn bout what you say
Flyin' fuck 'bout what you think
I'm gon ball by any means, bought my bitch 'bout everything
Flip my bird at the police, bitch this for beating Rodney King
Go! everyday I'm in some shit that you don't understand
I did it with my niggas I do it for the fans
My bitch so expensive dropped a car note on her bag
Motherfuck all you niggas, ya'll rather me doin bad

Just had to keep it real, shit just gave me chills
Lost so many homies that I knew throughout the years
Count so much paper, that shit come with haters
Brand new black 380 that came with this laser nigga
Try me if you want to, you be my example
Ya they sleepin' on me, you get shot in yo pajamas
So my niggas takin' chances, life is just a gamble
These niggas bitches Caitlyn Jenner
I've been on the same trail, got the 'nolia from the post
<i>[I've been ridin' on the sea?]</i>, I've been goin' crazy lately
I've been fucked by-bye you niggas
Give a fuck bout none you hoes
Shits 'bout me and my niggas hood nation
A motherfuckin' soldier

You won't understand, you won't understand no
