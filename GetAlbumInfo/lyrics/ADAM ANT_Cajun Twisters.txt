Get on your backstep where you belong
Leave your shirt and tie undone
Cajun twister all night long
You fight so hard to get your name
What big eyes you got grandma
On every tongue in every brain
What big eyes you got grandma
How in the hell can you complain
What big eyes you got grandma
Privacy's gone down the drain
Get on your backstep where you belong
Leave your shirt and tie undone
Cajun twister all night long
Pay attention
You fight so hard to get your name
What big ears you got grandma
On every tongue in every brain
What big ears you got grandma
How in the hell can you complain
What big ears you got grandma
Privacy's gone down the drain
You fight so hard to get your name
What a big mouth you got grandma
On every tongue in every brain
What a big mouth you got grandma
How in the hell can you complain
What a big mouth you got grandma
Privacy's gone down the drain
Get on your backstep....
You fight so hard to get your name
Please don't eat my leg grandma
On every tongue in every brain
Please don't eat my leg grandma
How in the hell can you complain
What a bore you popstars are
Privacy's gone down the drain
