I am armed to the teeth
You can't hold me down
I've turned seething 
into a hobby

Why is god out to get us
Can't we just be friends
I feel a twinge of righteousness
Like a corporate hedonist

Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money

The thugs are banging
in S.U.V.'s
My thoughts are changing into theories
The master of our destiny
Out in the graveyard of good ideas
That could have been the downfall of leaders
Yeah

Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money
Giants of industry
Come on come on and try to eat me
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready

What century 
are you living in
An ancient puzzle piece 
that won't fit in

Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money
Giants of industry
Come on come on and try to eat me
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready 
I'm ready
I'm ready
