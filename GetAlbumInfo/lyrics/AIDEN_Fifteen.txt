Fifteen I'm strung out 
once again and kicked out 
I think well I'm on my own, 
I'm on my own now, 
sixteen and I said goodbye 
to those I knew I'll never see 
well I can't see home 
I cant see home now 
when I look at the path 
That I chose and I'll say to you
Live Fast Die Young 
we'll stay out on the run 
so live fast and die young
Live Fast Die Young 
we'll stay out on the run
so live fast and die young
Seventeen I'm sleepin on the 
streets and no hope 
I think well I'm in the cold 
I'm in the cold now, 
I look to a god I said 
in my own life 
I'll never see well 
I can't see home 
I can't see home now 
when I look at the path 
that I chose and I'll say to you.
Live Fast Die Young 
we'll stay out on the run 
so live fast and die young
Live Fast Die Young 
we'll stay out on the run 
so live fast and die young
We'll cherish every moment last forever
We'll cherish every moment now
We'll cherish every moment last forever
We'll cherish every moment now
Go Go Go Go 
Live fast and die young
