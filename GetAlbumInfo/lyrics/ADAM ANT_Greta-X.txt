Party's over, it's time to change
Shoes away I neatly arrange
Next the hairdo
On the block
Put away my lovely frock
T.V. - T.V.

Underwear all tidied away
Thirty eight bust just for a day
Heels so high
My furs so fine
All a woman's things, they are mine
T.V. - T.V.

Oh, I'm a joyous glad T.V.
Why don't you come T.V. with me?
I know a girl who loves to dress me
Up like this and then caress me
To remind me of the way
I used to go both night and day
In femininity there's pride
We'll marry soon
I'll be the bride

Chi Chi Pamela or Barbara
What a good girl you really are
Poetry is awful, so is your prose
What's your gender?
No one knows
T.V. - T.V.

Oh, I'm a joyous glad T.V.
Why don't you come T.V. with me?
I know a girl who loves to dress me
Up like this and then caress me
To remind me of the way
I used to go both night and day
In femininity there's pride
We'll marry soon
I'll be the bride

T.V. - T.V.

I'm a joyous glad T.V.
Why don't you come T.V. with me?
I know a girl who loves to dress me
Up like this and then caress me
To remind me of the way
I used to go both night and day
In femininity there's pride
We'll marry soon
I'll be the bride

Oh, I'm a joyous glad T.V.
Why don't you come T.V. with me?
I know a girl who loves to dress me
Up like this and then caress me
