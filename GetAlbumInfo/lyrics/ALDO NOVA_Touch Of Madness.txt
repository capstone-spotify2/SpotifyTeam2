Here she comes
Looking like a red corvette
Moving like she owns the street
She's going to be the death of me yet

And she's so tough
But she know that I'm a rebel too
No Romeo and Juliet
Got anything on me and you

Cause a love that's true
Got to wear it so proud
Like a new tattoo

We'll set the night on fire
Just me and you
I can't dance
I can't love the night away
But it feels like a touch of madness
What can I say
But it feels like a touch of madness
Every time you're near

Now all the other bad boys
They try to take her breath away
But no matter what they do
She just smiles and walks away

Yeah, I feel alright
I'm just as bad as Brando
Cause I know that come tonight
I'm going to be the one that drives her home

Disconnects the phone
Gonna shut out the world
We'll be on our won

We'll set the night on fire
Just me and you
I can't dance
I can't love the night away
But it feels like a touch of madness
What can I say
But it feels like a touch of madness
Every time you're near

And she walks
And she talks
Here she comes
And I know she's the one
She's young
She's wild
Like a little child

We'll set the night on fire
Just me and you
Dance the night away
But it feels like a touch of madness
What can I say
But it feels like a touch of madness
