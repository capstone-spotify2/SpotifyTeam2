The planes and old airport
A long life
Short of great events
It seems like all the planes that come in on the quiet
Along the coast catch a glimpse of the world
Live and grow older

The planes are going south
A good mind
Strong and little used
It seems like all the planes that come in on the quiet
Along the coast catch a glimpse of the world
Live and grow older

Don't move the tears into my life
Somebody's out here, it's hard to describe
Do you know why?

The planes and old airport
A long life
Short of great events
It seems like all the planes that come in on the quiet
Along the coast catch a glimpse of the world
Live and grow older

Don't move the tears into my life
I find it hard, so hard to believe
Beauty of life

Oh, the planes that come in on the quiet
