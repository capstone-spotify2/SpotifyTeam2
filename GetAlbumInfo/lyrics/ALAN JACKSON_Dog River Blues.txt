Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well, we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you're long gone
You left me and the river here all alone

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the hall
And washed your picture right off the wall

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

Well, my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
If you change your mind honey I'll be here 
Waiting on the banks of that ole Dog River

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

For I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues...
