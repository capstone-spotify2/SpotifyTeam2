I talk to my mirror now
Why does it have to be me?
Oh, I listen to the rumours now
Pick up the pieces and see.
Oh, but I'd never hurt you, I wouldn't want to,
Why does everybody look for trouble when there isn't any?
No one listens to me, so I'm talking to you.

Go walk in your sunshine now
I'm standing here in the rain.
And it's a misunderstanding now
Nothing can cover my pain.
I'm here in the darkness, down in the shadows,
Why does everybody disappear when you need somebody?
No one listens to me, so I'm begging you to.

Why don't ya save me, save me, save me, save me, save me?
Tell me you love me, it'll be alright,
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.
Tell me you need me, it'll be alright,
I don't wanna lose you, I don't wanna love without you.
Tell me you want me, say that you need me
Don't wanna live without you, so why don't you save me?
Why don't you save me?
Save me, why don't you save me?

Love and devotion now
That's all I had in my mind.
Oh, but sorrow and heartache
That's all I seem to find.
I'm in the middle and I'm losing my grip
No one there to catch me when my world begins to slip,
No one's looking for me, so I'm talking to you.

Something to treasure now
Don't often happen these days.
Why don't you pick up the pieces now?
Don't watch them slipping away.
I need someone to hold me when my feelings are low
Somebody to tell me when I need to know,
Won't you listen to me, when I'm begging you to?

Why don't ya save me, save me, save me, save me, save me?
Tell me you love me, it'll be alright,
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.
Tell me you need me, it'll be alright,
I don't wanna lose you, I don't wanna love without you.
Tell me you want me, say that you need me
Don't wanna live without you, so why don't you save me?
Why don't you save me?
Save me, why don't you save me?
Save me!
