They say all the good things fade, looking at my past they right
But I swear you came my way, like an angel fell from the sky, no lie
Loving you the way you are, made a place in my heart for love
And I can never see us falling apart
We got that kind of fix it up kind of love
And girl, I don't mind giving you nothing
Cause in the lowest points of my life
You made a nigga feel like he's something

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Girl you've changed my life
Loving you is easy, it just feel so right
It's just us against the world
You and me, girl
My life, my life, my life
Girl you just that special
And it's us against the world
You and me girl

No one understands the way,
You really make me feel inside
If they had you like I have you babe
They would know that you're the one that gets me high
In this crazy world we're in,
You find a way to make me smile
And I know you had it rough before
That's why I takes my time to lay it down
And girl, I don't mind giving you nothing
Cause in the lowest points of my life
You made a nigga feel like he's something

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Girl you've changed my life
Loving you is easy, it just feel so right
It's just us against the world
You and me, girl
My life, my life, my life
Girl you just that special
And it's us against the world
You and me girl

Girl you've made me something different
I know the way you living
Whatever you need, guaranteed I'ma give it to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You are something never, long as we're together
Baby we're gonn win, no matter the weather
Me and you, nobody but you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Girl you've changed my life
Loving you is easy, it just feel so right
It's just us against the world
You and me, girl
My life, my life, my life
Girl you just that special
And it's us against the world
You and me girl.
