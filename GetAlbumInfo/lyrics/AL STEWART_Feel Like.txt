I feel as volatile as the weather
Over fields of Scottish heather
The night before Hallowe'en
You know I feel like
A catamaran in summer
The beat of a reggae drummer
The flag of a brigantine
This is the day when
All of my dreams came true
This is the day when
All of my life till now
Seemed oh so blue
You know I feel like
A plate of the earth in motion
A storm on the Indian Ocean
A shake of a tambourine
This is the day when
All of my feelings changed
This is the day when
All of my life till now
Seemed oh so strange
You know I feel like
A bird of a different feather
A trail that runs forever
Though a forest of evergreen
