Runnin runnin runnin 
Running with no where to go

You can't keep runnin forever babe
Don't know why your runnin run away
Cant keep runnin forever babe

Doing everything I'm tryna understand 
Why you runnin in and out of my life 
Wanna waste my time I'm tryna make it right

<i>[Rap:]</i>
There you go again with the games
Different day the shits still the same
You said you wanna leave
That's how you deal with pain
You say you wanna love
But the fear remain
N I gave u all that u asked
Fast cars and them bags
Took you out forever 21
Now you shopping at sacs
But all I get is yo ass 
From that bullshit and your past
All them other niggas you fucked with
Known for doing that fuck shit
But all I do is function 
And I ain't playing no games
Imma let you just keep runnin
And imma stay in my lane
