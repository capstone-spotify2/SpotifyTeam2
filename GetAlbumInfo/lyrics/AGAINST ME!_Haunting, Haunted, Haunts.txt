Tonight I can't sleep because I'm haunted
So I'm breaking spells of intention
All I can see is a space in between
The space where you're missing

I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
Now I'm not sure you ever were
I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
So guided, bound and willed
When the bar dried up, you were already gone

Rooms that I was left in and rooms that I since left
It was another life that I might have had
I know the feeling well, longing for something that's lost
I feel you like a phantom limb

I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
Now I'm not sure you ever were
I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
So guided, bound and willed
When I sobered up, you were already gone

Oh shit, oh no
What happens now?

This wine hasn't turned to vinegar, there's enough to pour a drink
But just one drink won't be enough to put myself to sleep

I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
Now I'm not sure you ever were
I once was drunk on you
So very stoned, fully compelled
So guided, bound and willed
When the bar dried up
When I sobered up
You were already gone
I'm shit out of luck
