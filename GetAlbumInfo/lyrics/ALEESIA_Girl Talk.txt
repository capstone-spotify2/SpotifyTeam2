Girls
Are you ready?

Every time I go out I, I, I
Seeing you cannot hide, hide, hide
Whispering all around, round, round
I can never escape that sound, sound, sound

You have me on your mind
All of the time
Get in trouble now
Say our thoughts out loud
There are no boys allowed

Cuz you know girls, yeah
They be talking
Oh, girls
They be talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girls
They be talking
Oh, girls
They be talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We're decked out in glitter
And my sparks short and fitted
And my heals out of control
Queen of fist bump and foam

My lips bright and pink
Yeah, they're stabbing at me
And they think we don't see
So I step back and wink
Girls

Now you keep blowing up my phone, phone, phone
Trying to get in my zone, zone, zone
Spreading rumors and speaking lies, lies, lies
Not gonna like what I'll reply, reply, reply

You have me on your mind
All of the time
Get in trouble now
Say our thoughts out loud
There are no boys allowed

Cuz you know girls, yeah
They be talking
Oh, girls
They be talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girls
They be talking
Oh, girls
They be talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We're decked out in glitter
And my sparks short and fitted
And my heals out of control
Queen of fist bump and foam

My lips bright and pink
Yeah, they're stabbing at me
And they think we don't see
So I step back and wink
Girls

Say ou, ah, na-na-na
Keep saying that blah blah blah
Little giggling ha-ha-ha
Keep giving that la-de-da

Say ou, ah, na-na-na
Keep saying that blah blah blah
Little giggling ha-ha-ha
Keep giving that la-de-da
