My dear there is no danger
Can't you see they turn blind eyes
To we swift and spotlight strangers?
Oh before the rush is over
We will be revered again
While the victims still recover

Oh!
If we run this light
Take a little life
No one will care at all
Oh!
We can burn it and leave
For we are the beautiful Thieves
No one suspects at all
No one suspects

Ah

Oh,
Are we running toward death?
I have met him times before
He adores us like the rest
Oh even if we're discovered
Just be sure to wear your best
We will surely make the covers

Oh!
If we run this light
Take a little life
No one will care at all
Oh!
We can burn it and leave
For we are the beautiful thieves
No one suspects at all
No one suspects

Who would run for cover?
Who would run from us?
Who would run for cover?
Who would run from us?

Oh!
If we run this light
Take a little life
No one will care at all
Oh!
We can burn it and leave
For we are the beautiful thieves
No one suspects at all
No one suspects at all
If we run this light
Take a little life
No one will care at all
Oh!
We can burn it and leave
For we are the beautiful thieves
No one suspects at all
No one suspects
