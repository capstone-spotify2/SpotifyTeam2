She's on her way to work, her heart is wearing thin
The tattoos leave a mark from everywhere she's been
Cause she's never in one place, she takes it on the chin
Now tears are welling up and they are rushing down her skin
While she's pushing trough the door, she hides behind a grin
But no one really knows how sad she feels within
Life goes on, put a sad song on

She's tryna go the distance, but she's running out of love
It doesn't make a difference, no it's never quite enough
Buys chocolate bars and magazines, the things that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
She goes home at 11 with her coat all buttoned up
Buys cigarettes and DVDs, the thing that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way to nowhere

Driving in the rain to her house right up the road
Her name is on the mailbox but it never feels like home
When she's climbing into bed, you know, she's climbing all alone
When she's climbing into bed, she's climbing on her own
Life goes on, put a sad song on

She's tryna go the distance, but she's running out of love
It doesn't make a difference, no it's never quite enough
Buys chocolate bars and magazines, the things that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
She goes home at 11 with her coat all buttoned up
Buys cigarettes and DVDs, the thing that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way to nowhere

He's working at the bar and takes a later shift
A little drunk and far too young to end up just like this
When he takes her by the hand, she does not resist
They're on their way to nowhere because nowhere sure beats this

She's tryna go the distance, now she's got a little love
A little makes a difference, even if it's not enough
The chocolate bars and magazines, just leave 'em on the shelf
And put 'em down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
The drive home at 11 to smoke cigarettes and stuff
The DVDs and memories, you keep them to yourself
From the way down, down, down
They're on their way to nowhere
