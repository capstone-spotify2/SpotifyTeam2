<i>[Action Bronson:]</i>
Uh
Waxy
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don't give a shit

<i>[Verse 1: Action Bronson]</i>
You only came around 'cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That's for the kids
And If there's anything left I'll cop a crib
And If there's anything left after that I'll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn't feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can't talk about that though...
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker <i>[laughs]</i>
Fuck
Fuck man
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Uh

<i>[Verse 2: Action Bronson]</i>
Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Hit him with stacks
Showed him the gat like 'you gonna miss the finger roll right'
Fuck
I Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like 'you gonna miss the finger roll right'

Then I cartwheeled into a aqua car

<i>[Action Bronson:]</i>
<i>[Trails into laughter]</i>
Shit!
It's too crazy right?
Yo

<i>[Verse 3: Action Bronson]</i>
I told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like âyou're gonna miss the finger roll right?â
Yes, Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into and aqua car
Now Iâm, sliding
Ma, your boy has made it, no more
Crying
The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around Iâll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldnât spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash
Ew...
