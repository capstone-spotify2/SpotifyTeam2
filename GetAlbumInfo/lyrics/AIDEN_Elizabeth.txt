She bathed in blood how apropos.
Became a witness to the suffering.
Skinned alive, she even took their soul.
Close my eyes.
By the moonlit darkness legend grows.
Torture only child`s play.
Sworn to pledge and gather peasant slaves.
Close my eyes.

Hey!, I want to live forever.
I`m in love with the dark horizon,
In the moonlight, I will bathe.

She placed her hand on heart and swore.
Every last one of them.
Will bring me youth, beauty, bliss galore.
Close my eyes.
And the basin was filled every night she dined.
In the den of iniquity.
And my sorrow filled reverie.
I Close my eyes.

Hey!, I want to live forever.
I`m in love with the dark horizon,
I`m in love with madness.
Hey!, I want to live forever.
I`m in love with the dark horizon,
In the moonlight, I will bathe.

Death comes for us all.
I won`t wait.

She bathed in blood that much you know.
Of the demon countess bathory.
Through these cemetery gates we go.
With my eyes closed.

Elizabeth!
She will not bathe alone.
Elizabeth!
She will not bathe, will not bathe alone.
Elizabeth!
Cannot save your soul.
Elizabeth!
She will not bathe, will not bathe alone.
ELIZABETH!
