<i>[Dead Girl:]</i>
I can see your pain
I can feel your loss
I can hear your words
I can but you are out of reach and so am I

<i>[Man:]</i>
You and me live in a dream
This could not have been foreseen
The pain won't go away

No one understands my grief
All I've got is my belief
Still mis you every day

<i>[Dead Girl:]</i>
I can't heal your pain
I cannot return, I cannot reply
I can't since you are out of reach and so am I

<i>[Man:]</i>
There is nothing left to be
You were all the world to me
The pain won't go away

No more reasons to survive
Why am I the one alive
I miss you every day

<i>[Dead Girl:]</i>
You know I am beyond reach forever

<i>[Man:]</i>
All these emotions create deeper oceans to drown in
My aspirations became unimportant once you were gone
Now the repression of all my aggression is hounding me
And all our devotion to love and each other
Buried with you, Dead!

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I feel the same tormenting pain
Don't stay behind so bitter

<i>[Dead Girl:]</i>
I have paid enough
I would have dried your tears if I could
I would be at your side
I would be there, forever more, that never came

<i>[Man:]</i>
I pay in pain
You have left me alone
My tears can't dry, I still need you
Forever more, that never came

<i>[Dead Girl:]</i>
I'll love you always
Love me forever!
