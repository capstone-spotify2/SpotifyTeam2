I hear the sky is falling, here we are, I'm empty.
I feel my heart is turning black tonight, Save me.
If all we are is dust and shades of grey,
How I wanted to say are we all alone 'cause I'm empty.

I'm terrified and blinded who we are in silence?
Take a picture let it breathe alright, we're mindless.
Armed with words and the fiction in your eyes.
I'm taking off my disguise.

Are you all alone, 'Cause I'm empty. Are you empty? I..
Are you empty tonight?

Now kiss me one last time,
And bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
Now kiss me one last time,
And bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.

I know the sky is falling, here we are, I'm empty.
I feel the world keep spinning am I high? Save me.
If we all we are is dust and shades of grey,
Then how I wanted to say,
Are you all alone? 'Cause I'm empty.
Are you empty? I..
Are you empty tonight?
All I fear tonight.

Will fiction get us through the night?
The sky is falling!
Conviction will get us through the night.
The sky is falling!
Will fiction get us through the night?
The sky is falling!
Conviction will get us through the night.
The sky is falling!
Will fiction get us through the night?
The sky is falling!
Conviction will get us through the night.
The sky is falling!

Conviction.
