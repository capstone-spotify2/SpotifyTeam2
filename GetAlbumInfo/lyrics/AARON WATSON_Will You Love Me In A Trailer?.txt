Will you love me in a trailer
Til I can get up on my feet
If it's August in Arizona
Could your heart stand the heat

I could never be an actor
Trying to be what I can't be
If I'm just a farm boy on a tractor
Could you love me just for me

And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
My everything's all I've got to give

Well old man Pete lives down the street
With his wife of sixty years
He said the hard times were bittersweet
And all they owned was a catalog from Sears

Mrs. Dorothy is his darlin'
She'd stand by him win or lose
She says now that they have money
Her only weakness is spending it on shoes

And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
My everything's all I've got to give
