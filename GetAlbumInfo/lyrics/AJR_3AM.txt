The coldest train car
Three o'clock at dark
Remember alcohol and dancing
Our friends are gone now
She chose me to take her home
I guess that's all I ever wanted

I just can't believe
That you chose a guy like me

Oh, no matter where you go
I will go down that road
The one that takes you home
After the party's done
And all is well, but I'm scared as hell
That you won't like me in the morning
Oh, that you won't like me
The way I like you

The coldest train car
Chilly Friday night
Hope she holds on to what I told her
The boys around her take a second look
She made the choice--the night is over

I just can't believe
That you chose a guy like me

Oh, no matter where you go
I will go down that road
The one that takes you home
After the party's done
And all is well, but I'm scared as hell
That you won't like me in the morning
Oh, that you won't like me
The way I like you

All is well, but I'm scared as hell
That you won't like me in the morning
I know you'll like me
The way that I like you
