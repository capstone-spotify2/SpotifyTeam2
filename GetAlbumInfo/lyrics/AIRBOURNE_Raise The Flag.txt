The battle ain't over 
The fight goes on 
We'll never surrender 
We're still standing strong 
As long as you're alive and we're alive 
Rock'n'Roll will never die 
From the southern stars to northern lights 
Rock'n'Roll will survive 
We're stocking the flame with high octane 
We'll never weaken of all 
Now is the time for you and I to answer the call 

Raise the Flag

Raise the Flag for rock'n'roll

Every night and day 
We got the pedal down 
Yeah we're going all the way 

As long as you're alive and we're alive 
Rock'n'Roll will never die 
From the southern stars to northern lights 
Rock'n'Roll will survive 
We're stocking the flame with high octane 
We'll never weaken of all 
Now is the time for you and I to answer the call 

Raise the Flag

C'mon raise the flag 
Raise the Flag for rock'n'roll
