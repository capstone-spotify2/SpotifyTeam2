He's a 
A hired gun
A man with no name
And when you meet him
You will never be the same

Feet in the gutter
Got his head in the stars
And his middle name's fun
The hired gun

Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge
Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge

A hired gun 
If you know what I mean
Never leaped away 
And he keeps himself clean

You got no money baby
He got the time
And his middle name's fun
The hired gun

Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge
Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge

He's a
A hired gun 
And he's not on the file
No name, red card number
Just a service with a smile

Money walks, money talks honey
Is his point of view
And you've got yourself some trouble 
'Cos he got it up for you

He's a 
A hired gun
And just so you know
The places he has been 
You don't wanna go

You got yourself a missile 
Way out of the blue
He's got a rocket in his pocket 
And it's homing in on you

Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge
Hired gun now (wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh-oh-oh)
Time to get the hell outta Dodge
