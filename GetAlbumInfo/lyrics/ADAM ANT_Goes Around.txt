Well, you walk the walk 
And you smile the smile
You don't care who you hurt
As long as it's me

Well you play the part
And you tear my heart
You don't care who you hurt,
As long as it's me 

Is that any way to behave?
Is that any way to behave?
Is that any way to behave, I ask you? 

And I believe
What goes around comes around
Goes around
And I believe 
What goes around comes around 

Well, you talk the talk
And smile the smile
You don't care who you hurt
As long as it's me

And you play the part
And you take my heart
You don't care what you take,
As long as it's free! 

Is that any way to behave?
Is that any way to behave?
Is that any way to behave, I ask you? 

And I believe
What goes around comes around
Goes around
And I believe 
What goes around comes around

And if you think you turned me over 
You'd better look over your shoulder!
And if you think it's all right
The guys are watching you, you, you! 

And I believe
What goes around comes around
Goes around
And I believe
What goes around comes around
Goes around
And I believe 
What goes around comes around
