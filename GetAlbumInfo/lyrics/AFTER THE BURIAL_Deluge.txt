And I was over taken, over whelmed and out of control
Visitors on parallel trails, unknowingly bound
Blue solitaries deluge, though I felt that I could swim  
Sight kept on the skyline so we become builders of ships
Aiming to be forgotten, waiting for the rain to regress
Iâll never look back, nothing really mattered âtil now
Decades waiting to be caught in your wind
And when your voice gave notes it pushed my sails

We found safety glowing within ourselves  
Just two children waiting at the window for the rain to stop
We found safety glowing within ourselves  
Just two children waiting at the window for the rain to stop

Decades became wading but we were never meant for a watery grave
Trapped in trivial downpour, decades became wading
But we were never meant for a watery grave

In solace, finding our footing, stepping out onto dry land  
Dawning a life of worth discovering a glow within
Blue solitaires deluge broke down walls and I gave in

Everything and anything I ever wanted really never meant
Thereâs so much greater gifts two give, we finally found a way  
Everything and anything I ever wanted really never meant
Thereâs so much greater gifts to give
Never meant for a watery grave

We found safety glowing within ourselves  
Just two children waiting at the window for the rain to stop
We found safety glowing within ourselves  
Just two children waiting at the window for the rain to stop
We were never meant for a watery grave
