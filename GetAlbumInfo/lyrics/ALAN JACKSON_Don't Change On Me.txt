Girl you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop

Just like the river
Keep love flowin'
Don't let our world stop
Keep it goin'

I like it just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me

Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on me

I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
Livin' in the darkness
Then you came
Bringin' sunlight
Easin' my pain

I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Girl don't change on me
Don't you change on me

Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me

If there's a heaven
This is my prayer
Lord knows I wanna know you
We should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothin' but sunshine
No more stormy weather

I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me

Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Oh now
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
