Never, no never, never
I'm beginning to think
I should say never
Never, no no never
Take my advice
No never
I'm beginning to see what's missing

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
Burnin' desire, house on fire

Never, no never, never
I'm beginning to see what you talking 'bout
I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to think I was wrong

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
A forgone conclusion
Too used to losin'

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But not that your lips are burning mine
Been seein' polka dots and moonbeams

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
Burnin' desire
House on fire

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But not that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light
Walk too slow and never been bright
I'm beginning to see the light
