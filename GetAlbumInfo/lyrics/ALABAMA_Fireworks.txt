Once I was cold
But now I know
How a fire works
'Cause I felt the flame
It drove me insane
Fireworks

There was this lady
Soft as as a gentle glow
She told me everything
That she knows
About fireworks
She's got fireworks

Now on the fourth of July
By the riverside
There was fireworks
And by her dark green eyes
I was hypnotized
By her fireworks

She lit a fuse in the
Dark of the night
Then I got off
Like dynamite
On her fireworks
She's got fireworks

A million colors shooting
Across the sky
Moment any man
Could fantasize
Ahw.. Fireworks
Got fireworks .. Ahw..

Now I'm meeting her here
But she's disappeared
And took her fireworks
She burning up someone
With her fever and fun
And her fireworks

Some lucky man is gonna
Need her so
And when he does
I know he's gonna know
Her fireworks
She's got fireworks
Fireworks

A candle burning at both ends
Fireworks

Hotbed of coal... Ahhh..
Fireworks
Fireworks

Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fireworks

Fireworks
Hot as coal... Ahhh..

Fireworks
Fireworks

Fire, fire
Oh, Oh,,,
Fireworks

Fireworks
Hot bed of coal...
