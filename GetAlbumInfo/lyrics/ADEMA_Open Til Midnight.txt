She needed shelter from the rain
She saw it on the sign
It said we're open till midnight
I'm sorry by the way
I came here just the other day
And you look so familiar
And maybe you and I can have a drink and start the night
With a friendly conversation, oh

Can you and I be truthful now?
What you run away from
And then you know the pain to make it through somehow
What you run away from
What you run away from

She woke before AM
To smoke a cigarette again
And she stood in the doorway (Stood in the doorway)
She said I love to watch you sleep
And hear the secrets that you keep
And remember what my father told me (Told me)

He said stay strong and don't forget to call
But don't ever come back at all

Can you and I be truthful now?
What you run away from
And then you know the pain to make it through somehow
What you run away from
What you run away from

It feel wrong
I think sometimes I'll cry the way I planned to
And even try
When you know something steered you wrong again
When did you decide
You don't belong here
You don't belong

Can you and I be truthful now?
What you run away from
And then you know the pain to make it through somehow
What you run away from
What you run away from
Can you and I be truthful now?
What you run away from
And then you know the pain to make it through somehow
What you run away from
What you run away from

I still walk away
I still clearly follow
I can not think today
What you run away from 
I'm just a run away
I still can not follow
I can not think today
I'm just an empty shell
