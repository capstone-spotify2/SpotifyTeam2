She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (she's coming out of thin air) 

She blew in like the wind 
Became more than just a friend 
And now I just can't wait to see her face again 
That girl so beautiful, got a body I can't forget 
She got style, she got class 
And her smile's like the sunset 

I can see the lighting , I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away.... 

She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 

Came out of nowhere 
I was not prepared 
Almost time to evacuate, I feel it getting near 
The sky is getting dark, and now I'm getting scared 
She got style, she got class 
The girl is a perfect storm... 

I can see the lighting, I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away...
