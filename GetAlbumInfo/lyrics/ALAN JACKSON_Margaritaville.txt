Nibblin' on sponge cake 
Watchin' the sun bake 
All of those tourists covered in oil 
Strummin' my six-string 
On my front porch swing 
Smell those shrimp hey they're beginnin' to boil 

Wasted away again in Margaritaville 
Searching for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
But I know it's nobody's fault 

I don't know the reason 
I stayed here all season 
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo 
But it's a real beauty 
A Mexican cutie 
How it got here I haven't a clue 

Wasted away again in Margaritaville 
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
Now I think 
Must be Buffet's fault

I blew out my flip-flop 
Stepped on a pop-top 
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home 
But there's booze in the blender 
And soon it will render 
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on 
Hang on

Wasted away again in Margaritaville 
Searching for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
But I know this is all Alan's fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
And I know it's our own damn fault
