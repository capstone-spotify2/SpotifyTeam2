I went down to the water
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Didn't know
What was waiting for me there
Nobody warned me
Nobody told me
My excuse is I wasn't prepared

I drank deep from the river
And sealed up my fate
I should have seen the trap, baby
Before it was too late

We go down 
We go down 
Go down is the only way out

Who is this fool
Who believed all the stories
I wish I could say
It's not me
You polluted my head
With all the things you said
I became what you wanted to see

All of these years 
I've built up this hate
I had my chance coming
But now it's too late

We go down
We go down
Go down -is the only way out
