hey hey hey hey hey <i>[X2]</i>

party time, gimme the beat, 
wave your hands from side to side, 
here we go

Some people live for the weekends
seems like such a waste
Counting down 'till the fun begins
what about the other days?

(there's monday night)
and Tuesday night 
(and tuesday night)
Wenesday, Thursday
Why wait?
365 days!

Life is a party
