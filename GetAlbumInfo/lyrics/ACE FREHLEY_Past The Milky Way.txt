This one's for Rachael

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Now I'm past the point of no return
And my computer is tellin' me I'm lost
And I hope and pray that I'll see you
'Cause I'm no quitter, not at any cost

Now I'm runnln' out of oxygen
But I still got my guitar
Celestial bodies they surround me
I don't think I'll make Venus
'Cause I've traveled very far
Could we rendezvous on Mars?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'd sail Past the Milky Way
Just to hold you in my arms

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Since I met you everybody tells me
When we're together I'm a better man
And you helped me feel so strong again
When I'm with you I always do the best I can

Now I'm runnln' out of oxygen
But I still got my guitar
Celestial bodies they surround me
I don't think I'll make Venus
'Cause I've traveled very far
Could we rendezvous on Mars?

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Now over and over again
All that matters is to see you smile, oh yeah!
I hope it's sooner than later
'Cause I'll be kissin' you in style, alright!

Now I'm runnln' out of oxygen
But I still got my guitar
Celestial bodies they surround me
I don't think I'll make Venus
'Cause I've traveled very far
Could we rendezvous on Mars?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
