I know we've seen some better days
But I never thought it got that bad
You told me love dies, people change
But I never thought you'd light the match
I need you every time that I'm alone
I feel you, please don't go

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
And let's do it again

And now we go our separate ways

In a story that seems so sad
Am I a distant memory
Like a stranger you never even met
I need you every time that I'm alone
I feel you, please don't go

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
Let's do it again

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again

I know you lie to hurt me
I know you lie to hurt me
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again
