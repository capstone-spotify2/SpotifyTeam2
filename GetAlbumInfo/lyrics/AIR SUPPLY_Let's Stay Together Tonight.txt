I Feel Your Hand In Mine
I Touch Your Skin
Your Heart Is Calling Out
You Want to Let Me In
Let Me In

Your Lips Are Silent Now
We're Not Alone
I Had To Tell You How Much
I'd Like To Take You Home
So I Can Make Love To You

I Believe In You So
And That There's Only One Moment To Live
When You're Here Next To Me
There's So Much More I Have To Give

When the Wind Blows, There's Nowhere Else You Can To Run
Lets Stay Together Tonight
I'm Waiting For You
All The Words That I Told You, Will Always Be True
Lets Stay Together Tonight
Whatever We Do

Why Must I Keep Pretending
I'm In Control
When I Can Feel Your Senses
Burning Through My Soul
Through My Soul

I Believe In You So
And There's Only One Moment To Live
When You're Here Next To Me
There's So Much More I Have To Give
When the Wind Blows, There's Nowhere Else You Can To Run To
Lets Stay Together Tonight
I'm Waiting For You
All The Words That I Told You, Will Always Be True
Lets Stay Together Tonight
Whatever We Do

Hold Me Close, Don't Let Me Go
I Just Want You To Say That
I Need You
I Want You To Know, Know, Know, Know

When the Wind Blows, There's Nowhere Else You Can To Run
Lets Stay Together Tonight
I'm Waiting For You
All The Words That I Told You, Will Always Be True
Lets Stay Together Tonight
Whatever We Do

Hold Me Close, Don't Let Me Go
I Just Want You To Say That
I Need You
I Want You To Know, Know, Know, Know

When the Wind Blows, There's Nowhere Else You Can To Run
Lets Stay Together Tonight
I'm Waiting For You
All The Words That I Told You, Will Always Be True
Lets Stay Together Tonight
Whatever We Do

When the Wind Blows, There's Nowhere Else You Can To Run
Lets Stay Together Tonight
I'm Waiting For You
