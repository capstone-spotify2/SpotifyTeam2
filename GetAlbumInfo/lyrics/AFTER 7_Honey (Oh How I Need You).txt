Oh how I need you honey
Oh how you bring me joy
Fulfill my life
Oh how much I need you
Oh how I need you honey
Oh how you bring my joy
Fulfill my life
Oh I need you yes I do

You came to me, like words to a melody
For love, just for you and me
Now you're in my life, I feel no more strife
Cause with you I'm happy

Your sweet and tender touch
How it means so much
When it's coming from your heart
From your heart, from your heart
Oh ordinary won't do, I'm glad
I found someone like you, cause with
You I'm happy

Oh how I need you honey
Oh how you bring me joy
Fulfill my life
Oh how much I need you
Oh how I need you honey
Like the flowers that need the sun
Like the grass that needs the rain
Oh I need you yes I do
I do!!!!
