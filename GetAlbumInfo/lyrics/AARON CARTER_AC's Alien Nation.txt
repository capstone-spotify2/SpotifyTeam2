AC, AC

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Shoulda known something was up 
When I got up 
Something felt funny to me 
From the get up
Jumped up out of the bed
With my head up

Guess who was staring at me? 
An ET or an alien 
But he said his name was Steve 
And he didn't look like what I thought he would be 
He said "Aaron, will you help me please 
Get your space suit and come with me"

So we hoped up, in the space truck 
It was all combed out with the system up
And I thought we were going to Mars 
We made a left 
At the dipper
Never figured that we'd be here with a space majiggy

We got there and I read a sign 
It said "Welcome AC, it's about time 
Can you show us, 
Can you help us, 
To dance tonight? 
'Cause we have no rhythm 
And weâre running outta time"

Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation

Listen up 
Hereâs what you got to do 
You take one step up 
Don't try to take two 
Make sure that you bump your fists like this
Nod like this, and rock like this

Cuz everybody gotta learn this way
To a be together, stay together
Know we gonna inovate
Moonwalk, star drop
A universal big top

Circus notice, and you gotta know this 
It really doesn't matter
If you're short or tall
Green or blue 
Fat or bald 
'Cause I came with a groove 
And I'm proving it all 
Around these parts we don't take no show 

With the unity soon to be in the streets
You can see with your own eyes
How far we've come
'Cause we didn't have rhythm, now we've got some
It's just another day in the AC Nation

Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation

You say you wanna dance 
Well, hereâs your chance 
(Uh, uh) 4-3-2-1 
Break it down, we gonna break it on down 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
Up and down and side to side
Câmon, what, we're gonna bounce like this 
What, what. We gonna pump them fists, what 
AC baby, AC baby, that's where we at Câmon, drop it down 
4-3-2-1
Drop it down

Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation

Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation

Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat don't stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation
