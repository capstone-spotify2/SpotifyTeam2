You need to get out of my sight
A lonely heart can beat
You're too dangerous
A lonely heart can bleed
I cannot stand it to be enclosed but isolated
A lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated
You're too much
A lonely heart is weak
Too dependant
A broken heart will seek
You take the life out of me, no heart is broken forever
Its broken promises, but my faith is broken forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze, but why?

A lonely heart will break
Pressure will make me forsake you
A lonely heart won't forsake me
As if we're both the same, wounded and beaten but still not defeated
A lonely heart can be wounded and beaten but still not defeated
'Cause I won't let you in!
So if it's all for real
Your weakness will be my strength
Your heart should be melting
You might be lonely but I am not beloved and bounded forever
Because we're all the same, beloved and bounded forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze, but why?
Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe
The power between us?

Oh discord, see them fail, oh!

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe the power between us?
Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze, but why?
