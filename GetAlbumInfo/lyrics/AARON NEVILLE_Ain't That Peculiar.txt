You do me wrong
But I'm still crazy about you
Stay away too long
And I can't do without you

Every chance you get
You seem to just hurt me more and more

But each hurt just makes my love go stronger
Stronger than before

I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love grow from pain

Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be

You tell me lies
It should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you, baby
That I don't want to see

That the things you do and say
Are designed to make me blue
But it's a doggone shame my love for you
Makes all your lies seem true

But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger?

Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be

I cried so much just as like a child
That's lost it's toy
Baby, baby, you think these tears I cry
Are tears of joy

A child can cry so much
And then you do everything they say
No, no, no, like a child my tears don't help me
To get my way

I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears?

Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be

I don't understand
Why you made me cry so much?
I don't understand
Why you lie so much?

And made me cry tears of pain
You made me cry for all that rain
I don't understand
Don't understand sometimes

Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be

Ain't that peculiar?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
