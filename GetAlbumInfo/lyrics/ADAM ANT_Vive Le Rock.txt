Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

I try to tell you but you just don't understand
You've got my entire life in your hands
Vive le rock, vive le rock
Oh well, you don't know what you're missing
'Cos you don't know what you got

And if the enemy don't see it your way
Be smart, play dead, live to fight a new day
And vive le rock, vive le rock
Oh well you don't know what you're missing
'Cos you don't know what you got

Vive le rock, vive le rock
Vive le rock

If this is it then I'm afraid it's not enough
Here's Johnny and he's calling your bluff
Vive le rock, vive le rock
Oh well you don't know what you're doing
'Cos you don't know what is what

Vive le rock, vive le rock
(Look out! rockers going Starwars!)

Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

You're scratching records but you won't be scratching mine
Don't give me chish-chash in rinky-dink time
Just vive le rock, vive le rock
Well I've been where I was going
And it's not Tom of Finland

Vive le rock, vive le rock
Vive le rock

Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

Look Ma, I'm on top of the world
