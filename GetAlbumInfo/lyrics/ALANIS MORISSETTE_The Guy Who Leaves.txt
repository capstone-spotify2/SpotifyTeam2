Get up, don't get up 
I beg you to sit tight 
Sweet girl, I'll be a ghost, girl 
Forget it, I am fine 

If anything, a witnessing 
Is all I needed that night 

Until I get what I'm to get 
He'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out his false story 
He'll keep playing the guy who leaves 

Brother, oh, brother 
Solo you did bust out 
All I knew was you didn't invite me 
So begin seeds of self-doubt 

There is nothing as harrowing 
As how I translate facts 

Until I get what I'm to get 
He'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out his false story 
He'll keep playing the guy who leaves 

Baby, oh, partner 
How well you've played this part 
Similar, oh, how familiar 
Reluctant truth you impart 

And how you served necessity 
Repeat 'til she sees light 

Until I get what I'm to get 
He'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out his false story 
I'll keep blaming the guy who leaves
