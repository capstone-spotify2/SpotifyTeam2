There's a town by a river
And a dirt road that runs through the town 
Winding around 
As a child I would daydream
Where that road might take me 
When my time for leavin' came down 
And each night I'd awaken
From a dream I was takin' 
That 'ol dirt road out of this town 
Sweet memories keep haunting me 
Callin' me like an old friend
And I pray that someday
I'll ride this highway
'Till it turns to that dirt road again 
Now I live in the city 
Where man made mountains of steel
To block out the sky
And that river of traffic 
That runs by my window 
Never seems to run dry 
And tonight before sleeping I pray God is keeping
That old place that I left behind 
Sweet memories keep haunting me 
Callin' me like an old friend
And I pray that someday I'll ride this highway
'Till it turns to that dirt road again 
In the city tonight
When I turn out the lights 
I'll be ridin' that 'ol dirt road again
