Take what you need, and leave the rest,
No I don't mind, no I don't mind,
I'll get this off my chest,
There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

Come flying in, and then again,
I'm not here long enough to pretend that I seem so well,
There's nowhere else you'd rather be.

Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering 'round me,
And I move near, you fly away.
Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering near me,
As I move near, you fly away.

Don't fly away <i>[x3]</i>

What can I say, you have to wait,
You find it hard to say and to articulate,
I know there's nowhere else you'd rather be.

It seems so clear, I know we're through,
Yet all I wanna do is make love to you,
I know there's nowhere else you'd rather be.

Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering near me,
As I move near, you fly away.
Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering near me,
As I move near, you fly away.

Don't fly away <i>[x5]</i>

Buzzing around my head, things you have done,
The words you have said.
Remember me, after you've left,
I'll try but I can't forget.

Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering 'round me,
As I move near, you fly away.
Like a hummingbird in flight you are,
Hovering, hovering 'round me,
As I move near, you fly away.

Don't fly away <i>[x5]</i>
