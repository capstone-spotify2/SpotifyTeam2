I would die for you baby
I cry for you baby
I'm on my knees for you baby
I won't ya please give me some of your love

I've got eyes for you baby (Oh yeah)
I'd go blind for you baby (Oh yeah)
I will steal for you baby (Oh yeah)
If you just gimme some of your love

Some of your love
Will keep my soul intact
Some of your love
Will keep the storm clouds back
I don't think I could ever come back
If you don't give me some of your love

She showed me things (Oh Yeah)
That I never knew (Oh Yeah)
They been there forever (Oh Yeah)
But it's the first time that I flew

Some of your love
Will keep my soul intact
Some of your love
Will keep the storm clouds back
I don't think I could ever come back
If you don't give me some of your love

You're the stars in the sky
And there's no wondering why
Now the moon's coming out
Our heart start to race
There was never a doubt
Just the sudden embrace
Your beautiful soul
Your beautiful face
One sweet kiss
And I just gotta say

(Oh Yeah)

I would die for you baby (Oh yeah)
I would cry for you baby (Oh yeah)
I'm on my knees for you baby (Oh yeah)
I won't ya please give me some of your love
