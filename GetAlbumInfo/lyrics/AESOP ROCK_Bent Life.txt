<i>[Aesop Rock]</i>
Yo
I take 10 steps with a bedlamped vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and shake hands with my grimace that remain up in
my face like top to bottom train car feelings
Lets question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affect
I'm blow this hex over the mission
Just to administer the indoor sucker punch to <i>[?]</i> its pitiful condition

<i>[C-Rayz Walz]</i>
With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
"Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do

<i>[Aesop Rock - Chorus]</i>
It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, act of development first of madness

Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion

<i>[C-Rayz Walz]</i>
A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient
In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing
Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)
The traincar used to be my apartment
Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out
Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout
"The Biz is Coming, The Biz is Coming!"?
Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)
We just getting flurries now?

<i>[Aesop Rock]</i>
Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn,
You're movin much to fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like 1970 something 20 clicks outside your name (tear obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
but they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
just aint working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping <i>[?]</i> solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
to intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
together specimens from the promise land
This for the thinkers
This for the erchants allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
but cant remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all that's said and done
are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one

<i>[Chorus]</i>
