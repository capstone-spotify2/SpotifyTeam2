I watched you go out the door
With poise I'd not seen before
I saw you shine, you shine
I collapsed to the floor
It promised it'd miss me more and said,
"True love is mine.
I missed you.
Did you miss me?"

Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply

I haven't left here for days
My panic keeps me awake as he unwinds inside
He told me I should have known
That he hated the way I'd grown to love soft lies
She lied
"Do you miss her?
Like I miss you?"

Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply

Slowly, I'll swallow your fears
For all of those years
How could you let them consume me?
Teach me, teach me how you sleep
So sweetly

Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me how you sleep
So sweetly
