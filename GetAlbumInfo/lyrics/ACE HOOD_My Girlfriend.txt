Why the fuck this bitch texting my phone
You're not my girlfriend

I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I be kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business she be lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

Young nigga too beast mode and I'm 'bout it 'bout it like P
Put my chains on and my doors off and I'm hanging out of that Jeep
I been hated on I been talked about and they tellin' lies on me
It gon' be televised when I re-arrive in them peoples eyes with that key
Who are you betting your chips on, we celebrate in the end zone
This is the shit that the pen doing, I'm in the coupe it depends on
I'm on the way to the top, I do not fuck with the opps
We bending off of the lot, I think I figured it out
Niggas ain't willing to grind, boy is you out of your mind
I am the one who divine, I am just one of a kind
Preach, preach, preach on 'em, they sleep keep on
Keep, keep, keep on, same beats new form

Get out my lane, that kidney pain
Took out the brain, I met the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame
Look were I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she wanna rain
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby ion even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it babe sorry I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe, you got another guy
She said can I come again, maybe girl another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty like Amber Rose
