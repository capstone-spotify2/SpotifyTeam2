Step right up come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of the lonely house that once was
Home sweet home

I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you
To the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
Sit down on my knee and whisper
Oh, I love you

But now she's gone forever
And this old house it will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we'd lie in love together
And Lord knows we had
A good thing going here

See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say
Good mornin' dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Where she left them when
She tore my world apart

As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Takin' nothin' but our baby
And my heart

Step right up come on in
Come on in
