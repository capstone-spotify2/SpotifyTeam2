Ever since the stone-age
Man's been on the hunt
We were born to kill

Fighting for survival
All in self-defence
It was do or die

Now we're living in jungles
The concrete age
A maximum overdose of pleasure and pain

Self-inflicted - life corrupting
Antisocial - controversial - living in sin

Sodom and Gomorra
Let me tell you what I see
Sodom and Gomorra

Got not law and order
Ruled by anarchy
It's here to stay

Chaos in the classroom
Kids are killing kids
Getting outta hand

Mothers and fathers - the sickening ones
Raping the children
At the end of a gun

Self-inflicted - life corrupting
Antisocial - controversial - living in sin

Sodom and Gomorra
Let me tell you what I see
Sodom and Gomorra
We're in a burning hell for all eternity

Sodom and Gomorra
You mustn't look back
To Sodom and Gomorra
Don't you look back -
to the essence of evil

This universe of hatred
Aggression is the force
Heading for oblivion
We're on collision-course

Evolution's over
The devil has prevailed
Heaven screams for vengeance
This is judgement day

Self-inflicted - life corrupting
Antisocial - controversial - living in sin

Sodom and Gomorra
Let me tell you what I see
Sodom and Gomorra
Forever ruled by anarchy

Sodom and Gomorra
Forever damned to purgatory
Sodom and Gomorra
