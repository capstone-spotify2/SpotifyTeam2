These eyes they have seen the world
These feet they have walked a thousand miles
My lungs have screamed countless melodies
How do I find the words, the motivation?

I know I could have it all but there's a price so high
A drop of blood is all it takes

Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?
Will they be there when you start to fall?
I will never let go, let go of the night
The night we decided we could have it all

Chasing a meaningless ending
Without a good reason I'm just second guessing
Because I'm honestly fine beneath the wool
Take the road less traveled
Wait to see where it will lead
Maybe I'm just afraid
Maybe I am okay
Tell me are you second guessing?
Because you honestly seem to have it all
Are you under control or questioning how this all ends?

I could have it all but there's a price too high
A drop of blood is all it takes

Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?
Will they be there when you start to fall?
I will never let go, let go of the night
The night we decided we could have it all

Stand and fight, swine!
Are you man enough to confess your lies?
Shaking the devil's hand, never missing a beat
You are a snake amidst the jewels of thieves
You crawl slithering cowardly fueled by empty respect
Your soul reeks of addiction
What's the price? Where's the line?
Sacrificing my honor just to be what you are?
I would rather be put to death

Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?
Will they be there when you start to fall?
I will never let go, let go of the night
The night we decided we could have it all

I'll never be you
