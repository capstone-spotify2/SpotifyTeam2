Sometimes she'll laugh
And sometimes she will cry
Sometimes she'll get mad at you
And leave you wonderin why
A woman's mind is a mystery
That no man can uncover
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her

What she wants
And what she needs
May be two different things
And the words you hear so clear
Aren't always what they mean
She may say that she's cold at night
Just to have you hold her
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her

The ocean doesn't ask why
The moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out show her you love her
If she smiles and says she loves you as the tears roll from her eyes
Then you've found a treasure
That only true love can find
A woman's heart has parts that will never be discovered
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her

The ocean doesn't ask why the moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her

If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Just show her you love her
