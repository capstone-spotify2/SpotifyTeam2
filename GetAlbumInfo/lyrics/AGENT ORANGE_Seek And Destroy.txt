We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths

Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy

There's no escape and that is for sure
This is the end we won't take anymore
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking but now you're giving

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths

Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There's only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away cause you're the one that we'll find

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths

Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
Searching,
Seek and destroy
