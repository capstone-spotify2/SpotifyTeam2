I don't wanna stay here but I can't leave
I'm in the spell of the magic you weave
Somebody wake me up
I wish I could break it up
But I can't shake loose
Can't shake loose
I can't shake loose
Can't shake loose
Any move I'll make in the end I will loose
I can't shake loose
I try and I try but it ain't no use
I could go like I did before
But these old shoes keep walking to your door

I wanna hide but when I hear you call
If i turn around I know I will fall
One step people shake
No matter what move I make

Cos' I can't shake loose
Can't shake loose
I can't shake loose
Can't shake loose
Any move I'll make in the end I will loose......
I don't wanna stay here
But you know I can't leave
Please let me go dear
Please let me leave

I can't shake loose
I can't shake loose
I can't shake loose
Can't shake loose
Any move I'll make in the end I will loose
I can't shake loose
I try and I try but it ain't no use
I could go like I did before
But these old shoes keep walking to your door
I can't shake loose......
