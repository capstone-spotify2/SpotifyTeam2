Once again, 
Here am I wrapped up in a dream, I'm about to lose my mind 
Over you, I've done it again 

Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 

I've been in love before 
I've been hurt before 
I thought I was through with being a fool 
But I ended in the same shoes once more 

Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 

I've done it again 
You know, I know I've done it again 
Over you, I've done it again
