You can find me on the other side of the border 
Where the 100 grand in my pocket 
For the first trip jus pack a lil somthin 
Cause ima bring the work back by the air 
Or even by water 
What ever it take to get to the crib 
Gotta play it safe cause they out there 
See i got so much client ? waiting 
I cant just make one trip 
But i gotta get enough to supply the sibling 
But i gotta be careful smugglin in 
Vaseline rapped around so it hide the sent 
While i wait Jose 
He 'll bring it to me
