You can go, go, go
'cause I know, know, know
I have found another love to take your place

Down down down came the tears
Since you went away and left me here
But up, up, up went my love, love, love
I have found another love to take your place

Fast, fast, fast went the train
That took you to the arms of another man
But you can go, go, go
'cause I know, know, know

I have found another love to take your place
I thought that I could live without you
I thought that I would never love again
Someone came along with a love so strong
I forgot about you and once again I feel like a man

Whoa, I have found a love that's true
I hope that you have done the same thing too
If you're not happy, don't come back to me
I have found another love to take your place
I have found another love to take your place
