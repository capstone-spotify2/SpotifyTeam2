Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind.
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you...
Yes your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you...

When we are together the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you
