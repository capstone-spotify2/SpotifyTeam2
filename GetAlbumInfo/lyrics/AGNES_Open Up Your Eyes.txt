Your heart feels like it's been run over
You call and ask if you can come over
I say yes even though I know better
But I guess I'm hoping that you've finally left her
You run back here to my door
Every time that you need a friend
Don't you know that I want to be more
So I keep wondering when

Through every tear every fear I was always here
Open up your eyes
And I could be everything that you really need
Open up your, open up your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, open up your eyes

You say you don't know what you'd do without me
That I'm the only one who cares about cha
It's hard to love someone and try to hide it
If I said it doesn't hurt well I'd be lying
There's so much that I have to give
I want to show you what I'm feeling inside
I hate to see it when you're hurting like this
When I could treat you so right

Through every tear every fear I was always here
Open up your eyes
And I could be everything that you really need
Open up your, open up your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I would never step across the line
And tell you what to do
But there's only so much more that I can take
Look at me in a different light
Don't let me walk out of your life

Through every tear every fear I was always here
Open up your eyes
And I could be everything that you really need
Open up your, open up your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes
I could be everything that you really need
Open up, open up your eyes, your eyes
