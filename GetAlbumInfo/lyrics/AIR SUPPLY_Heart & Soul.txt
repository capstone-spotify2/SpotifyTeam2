Just loving you has left the world behind
I wish I knew how love could be so blind
Now all these thing I never can let go
Can't let go

I'd give you my heart and soul( I'd give you my heart and soul)
If that's what it takes to prove myself to you

I under stand my life has lost control
What would I do without your love to hold
Nobody knows how much I've come alive
All that I have to give I give to you from deep inside

I'd give you my heart and soul (I'd give you my heart and soul)
If that's what it take to prove myself to you
I'd give you my heart and soul (I'd give you my heart and soul)
To hold you now and let your love come thru

And all these nights I sat alone waiting for someone
And here you are my very own, waiting for so long
I want to give you more than you have ever known before
