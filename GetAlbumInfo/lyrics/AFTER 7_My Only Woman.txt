You're the kinda woman
That every guy wishes that he could meet
You're a cut above the rest girl
And it's a fact, you are a beauty queen

The way you love me
Makes my life worth living
You got a special way that touches my heart
You know you're the only
Woman that's ever given
Giving me so much
You are my shining star

You are my only woman
You are my only girl
You are my only woman
I'm gonna keep on
Gi-Giving
Good love to you

My only woman
You're my only girl
My only woman

I will be your lover
Everyday for life. If ya want me to
Cause girl there is no other
That can do the things that I want to do

Sometimes I wonder
Could it be that I'm dreaming
I never thought my dreams would ever
come true
Now that I got you
Girl you got me believing
That happiness is mine
Long as I'm loving you
Ya-know

My only woman
You're my only girl
My only woman

Only one
My only one
You're the one
Girl you're number one
Only one

Number one girl
Oh Baby rock my world

You are my only woman
You are my only girl
You are my only woman
I'm gonna keep on
Gi-Giving
Good love to you

Oh the finest woman I've ever seen
On a movie star and beauty queen
No I can't stop thinking about the way I feel
There's no doubt about it baby my love
is real
You are the one

You are my only woman
You are my only girl
You are my only woman
I'm gonna keep on
Gi-Giving
Good love to you
