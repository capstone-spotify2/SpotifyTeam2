Better off alone
Better off alone
It's real natural, supernatural if you may
Nobody to hold
Better off alone

Time is of the essence, that's how the saying goes
Can't stop for nothing, I gotta go
Gotta kick that shit and reach my goal
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
I don't know who I trust, I don't know who I know
I don't know who to hug, I don't know who to choke
Cause niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
I don't fuck around like sex on a merry-go
No, I bet my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas
Cause see

They can't hate what they don't know
And they can't take what you don't show
I be better off alone
Say I be better off alone
Cause when I'm by myself I surprise myself
I could get where I'm goin', I could drive myself
With nobody to hold
Say I be better off alone

I'm movin' in slo-mo with little to no dough
It feels like everything I do is a no-go
And I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo
I ride solo
Cause I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo

My lady got me stressin', but I canât blame her no
She need more time, but I'm always in the studio
Random niggas beggin' for me to feature on they songs
I wanna tell them no, I'm workin' on my own
Success'll make ya true nigga true colors show
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
Yeah niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
Like Cedric or any comedian you know
No, I bear my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas
Cause see

I like this right here, Punch
Feels right, know what I mean?
It's like one of them type of joints where you just
Spill your soul, know what I mean?
Just put your soul on a platter, know what I mean?
Or platter, excuse me
Supernatural, real things, real feelings, real emotions
Know what I mean?
