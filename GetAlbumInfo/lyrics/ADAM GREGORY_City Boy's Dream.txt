I dreamt last night I was far away
Where coyotes howl and cotton woods sway
Casting shadows in firelight
A cowboy moon burns so bright

And I don't care if it's rain or shine
And all my troubles will be miles behind
Untie the reins and change my course
And close my eyes and saddle my horse
Out in the open where the Buffalo roam

That's where I'll make my home
Don't need no highway, don't need no roof
Cactus Cowboys know the truth

I've been living in a Roy Roger's song
Something 'bout where my heart belongs
My horse and I will never give in
We'll ride away in a western wind

I dreamt last night I was far away
Where coyotes howl and cotton woods sway
