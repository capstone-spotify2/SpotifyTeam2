Watching waiting rising falling
Listening calling drifting
Touching feeling seeing believing
Hoping sending leaving

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
If I tried to write a million words a day
I see your shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting away

<i>[VERSE]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
We're travelling a million worlds away
I see your shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting away
