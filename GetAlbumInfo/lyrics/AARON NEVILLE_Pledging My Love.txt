Forever my darling, our love will be true
Always and forever, I'll love only you
Just promise me darling, your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear forever burn

My hearts at your command dear, to keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire dear, keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you for the rest of my days
I'll never part from you and your loving ways

My hearts at your command dear, to keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire dear, keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you for the rest of my days
I'll never part from you and your loving ways
