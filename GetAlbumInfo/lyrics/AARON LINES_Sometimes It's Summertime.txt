Skimpy bikinis and bear skin
It's always good to see them out again
Cabin fever, grey skies
Six months of winter finally waved goodbye
Sometimes this world seems cold as ice

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime

Grab a cooler, a 12 pack
I'll rub some lotion up and down your back
Flip flop living, stress free
Nothing to do we got no where to be
Come on baby drift away with me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
All your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Nothing but peace of mind
Leave all your cares behind
Sometimes it's summertime

Sometimes it's summertime
