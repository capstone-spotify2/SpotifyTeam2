You might think I`m going out of my mind
But I`m chasing out my dream
`Cause I would go to the moon and back
Just to tell you how I feel

You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul
I will never let you go
You are my world, my favorite girl
You make me lose control

I wanna hold your hand by the sea
Wanna feel you next to me
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes
Wanna keep you by my side

You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul
I will never let you go
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes
Wanna keep you by my side

(I love you â¦ my baby
You drive me â¦ so crazy â¦ <i>[x2]</i>)

You might think I`m wasting all of my time
But I`m not changing my mind
`Cause I will hold you girl by my side
I will hold you then in mind

You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul
I will never let you go
You are my world, my favorite girl
You make me lose control

I wanna hold your hand by the sea
Wanna feel you next to me
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes
Wanna keep you by my side

You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul
I will never let you go
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes
Wanna keep you by my side

(I love you â¦ my baby
You drive me â¦ so crazy â¦ <i>[x3]</i>)
I love you, I love you, I love you â¦
