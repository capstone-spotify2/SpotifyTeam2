The shore would never reach as far
As once before, I wonder where you are
The rainbow came before the rain
And I'm still here but not the same

We saw and reached for everything
So very sure what this new love would bring
Both caught upon a rushing tide
And not one thought would be denied

Until there is a reason my heart can understand
Until I know how love fell
So easy to my hands

Until I know the season that tells a heart to break
Until we learn to give back
As easy as we take

Until there is a reason, my heart can understand
Until, I know how fell
So easy to my hands

Until I know the season, that tells a heart to break
Until we learn to give back
I'll be here beside you
Until, until
