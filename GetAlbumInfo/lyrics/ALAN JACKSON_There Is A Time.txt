There is a time for love and laughter
the days will pass like summer storms
the winter wind will follow after
but there is love and love is warm

There is a time for us to wander
when time is young and so are we
the woods are greener over yonder
the path is new the world is free

There is a time when leaves are falling
the woods are gray the paths are old
the snow will come when geese are callin'
you need a fire against the cold

There is a time for us to wander
when time is young and so are we
the woods are greener over yonder
the path is new the world is free

So do your roaming in the springtime
you'll find your love and summer sun
frost will come and bring a harvest
and you can sleep when the day is done

There is a time for us to wander
when time is young and so are we
the woods are greener over yonder
the path is new the world is free
the path is new the world is free

There is a time for us to wander
when time is young and so are we
the woods are greener over yonder
the path is new the world is free
