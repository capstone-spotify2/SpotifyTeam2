You're coming off kinda contrived and pretentious.
You're not saying anything we haven't heard before.
You're caught up in an argument.
Oh, oh you're so lost in modern art.

You will lose it all.
And you will find again.
Don't lose touch.
Don't lose touch.

S.O.S. texted from a cell phone?
Please tell me I'm not the only one,
that thinks we're taking ourselves too seriously,
Just a little too enamored with inflated self-purpose.

Talk is cheap.
And it doesn't mean much.
Don't lose touch.
Don't lose touch.
I'm losing touch.
I'm losing touch.

Constant entertainment for our restless minds.
Constant stimulation for epic appetites.
Is there something wrong with these songs?
Maybe there's something wrong with the audience.
Manipulation in rock music, fucking nausea.

I'm losing touch.
I'm losing touch, and it's obvious.
