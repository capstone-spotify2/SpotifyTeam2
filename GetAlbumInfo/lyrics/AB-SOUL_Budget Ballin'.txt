You could find me in the hood poppin'
Or in the club stuntin'
There is no
Other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin'
So
I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Defy the odds when I step out the house
Pull a chick lookin' like a nigga fresh off the couch
Then I pull up in that white thing
But I don't mean it as if its something to brag about
Shit, my car's just white man
Sharp as a tack, in track to get at the club
Bottle service reserved
Go on and po' you a cup
I sip until I throw up
My hands dance in the cut
By myself I ain't lying
Attracting all of the sluts
I got a chip on my shoulder
Like there was chips in my pocket
There ain't a cent in my jeans
But you might smell the ganja
I must be living a dream man
You say I'm her dream man
So why take advantage of her
Fuck her to dreamland
<i>[?]</i>
Absolutely, but I love it ya'll
Still drink that cheap shit
That smells like rubbing alcohol
Still going half on a sack
Hitting pretty broads
Taking off pretty Vickys
With the matching pretty
Bras

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Give em' the chills
Rollin' on hot wheels
It ain't mine, it's the homie's
I'm just keeping it real
Say I'm phoney baloney
Even words tryna bone me
I got the hood on my back
Ain't gotta tattoo it on me
But as a matter of fact
I'mma tattoo it on me
I know you thinking I'm immaculate
That's accurate, homie
(Word Up)
Like the magazine with all of them posters
I keep a Halle Berry in the ashtray full of roaches
(To smoke up)
Pass the light
I'm finna have me a night
If your wifey's hitting the club
Before she leaves, hold her tight
Look her dead in the eye
Tell her you love her to death
And hope she don't come home with black and mild on her breath
It's Ab-Soul, the best dressed nigga in debt
Got chicks fresh outta high school, adult swimwear
(Yes)
I know I make it look simple
Like it ain't really nothing
Cause it ain't really nothing, no

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Keep it cool, they know I'm hot
(And I)
Do what it do, running the spot
(And I)
Don't want no problems
I'm just really tryna party
Ain't a dollar in my wallet
And nobody tryna rob me
(So I)
Keep it cool, they know I'm hot
(They know I'm hot)
Do what it do, running the spot
(Running the spot)
Don't want no problems
I'm just really tryna party
Ain't a dollar in my wallet
And nobody tryna rob me
(So I)
Tell myself its too good to be true
These niggas like, "Ab, I bet it feel good to be you"
But I'm just living my life, like T.I. and Rihanna
Making grown women melt, like ice in a sauna
And you know I got my shades on
Mackin' a model that keeps pronouncing my name wrong
I don't cuff her, but she respects my authority
So when you lookin' for a G

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
