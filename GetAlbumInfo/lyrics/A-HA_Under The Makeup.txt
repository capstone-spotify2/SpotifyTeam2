This is how it ends
Each on our own
Unless we pretend
Meanwhile our hearts turn to stone
Shaped by wind
Boulders slowly molded over time
Here within

I, I want to see you
Under the makeup
Let all the worry
Vanish away
I want to hold you
Like itâs the first time
Like you were still mine

If you wanted out
Didnât I let you go
If you wanted in
Didnât I make it so
It could be
Tenderness escapes so easily

I, I want to see you
Under the makeup
Let all the worry
Vanish away
I want to hold you
Like itâs the first time
Like you were still mine

I, I want to see you
Under the makeup
Let all the worry
Vanish away
I want to touch you
Like itâs the first time
Like you were still mine

I, I want to see you
Under the makeup...
