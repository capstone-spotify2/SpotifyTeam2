I'm mad, still mad about you
It's too bad, I'm bad without you

Don't touch
you've already said too much
Pick and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 

You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground

Lovesick, but I'm still sick of you
I quit, was too quick to love you

Don't touch
you've already said too much
Come back and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 

You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground

There's no way back this time
So we gotta leave it all behind

Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh

You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground

You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground

You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground
