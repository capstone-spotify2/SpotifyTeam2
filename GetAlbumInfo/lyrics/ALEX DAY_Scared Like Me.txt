When I was young
I wanted a coffin
Cos I was told
That it was tradition
Making my mark in the Earth
Duty was told to come first
But now I know
To live and be nervous
If you're not scared
You're not living with purpose
So now they can burn me away
I'll make my mark other ways

So take a chance
And run with me tonight!
And we can dance
Until we're terrified
Cos when it's dark
That's when we'll come alive
Let yourself be scared like me
Let yourself be scared like me

I always thought,
If I had superpowers
And if I could choose
How to live out my hours
I'd choose immortality;
I'd be here permanently
But if life's long
It won't guarantee meaning
I might just spend
Twice as long a life sleeping
So now I think I'd choose to fly;
It's hard to sleep in the sky

So take a chance
And run with me tonight!
Where we can dance
Until we're terrified
Cos when it's dark
That's when we'll come alive
Let yourself be scared like me
Let yourself be scared like me

I don't expect your heart
I only want your honesty
If I push you too far
Just tell me like you promised me

So take a chance, and
Run with me tonight!
Where we can dance
Until we're terrified
Cos when it's dark
That's when we'll come alive
Let yourself be scared like me
Let yourself be scared like me...
