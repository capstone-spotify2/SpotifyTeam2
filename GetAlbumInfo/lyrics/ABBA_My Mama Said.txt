Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"

Yeah, I did what she had told me
Dying for my friend to hold me
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"
How I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

In the morning she said "Listen"
Ooh, I felt like in a prison
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"
(My mama said)
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"
(My mama said)
Oh I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

I said, "I can live without him.
How I wish you wouldn't doubt him."
Oh oh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"
(My mama said)
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"
(My mama said)
Oh I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
