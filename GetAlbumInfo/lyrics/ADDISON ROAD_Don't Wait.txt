Today I lost a friend of mine
I never even got to say goodbye
I thought we had time to burn
But life is short you only get one turn
Oh gone before you know
Oh so make the most

Weâre not indestructible
Our lives, unpredictable
It can turn on a dime so now is the time
Donât wait, donât wait, donât wait
Gotta live today

So here I am wide awake
Blinded by a brand new day
Every breath given to me is a gift I want to redeem
Oh the minutes they unwind
Oh so I gotta make the time

'Cause Weâre not indestructible
Our lives, unpredictable
It can turn on a dime so now is the time
Donât wait, donât wait, donât wait
Gotta live today

In the blink of an eye
You snap and time goes by, time goes by
Weâll wonder where it went
If we forget, so donât forget

Weâre not indestructible
Our lives, unpredictable
It can turn on a dime so now is the time
Donât wait, donât wait, donât wait
Gotta live today
