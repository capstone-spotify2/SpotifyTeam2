Realize that I've lost control, impulses keep flashing through my head
I'm on the outside

Take up all my life inside, why would I let them make up my mind
And be mislead
Go ahead make up your mind
I have had enough of who they want
Leave me alone

This pain inside I can't understand
This hate in life that will not go away (Go away)

Go ahead make up your mind
I have had enough of who they want
Leave me alone
Realize that I've lost control, impulses keep flashing through my head
I'm on the outside

This pain inside I can't understand
This hate in life that will not go away (Go away)
This pain inside I can not live with it
It feels like no one really understands

It's always killing me (Killing me)
The problems I face daily
It's always things that I have always take in vain
I'm sick of you judging me
I'm sick of you judging me
I'm sick of you judging me

This pain inside I can't understand
This hate in life that will not go away (Go away)
This pain inside I can not live with it
It feels like no one really understands

It's always killing me
The problems I face daily
