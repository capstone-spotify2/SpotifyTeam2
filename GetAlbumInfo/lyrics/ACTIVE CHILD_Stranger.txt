don't wanna be afraid
This is crazy
We're gonna have to make some changes

And all I want
Is to see inside your mind
It's like I wrote it down
Before we even tried to be

Still I think we will survive
If I can wait until

You enslave me
From all the times I've betrayed you
And in this way, baby
You're always gonna remain a stranger

And all I want
To get inside your mind
It's like we wrote it down
Before we even tried to be closer

Can you save me?
Can you save me?
