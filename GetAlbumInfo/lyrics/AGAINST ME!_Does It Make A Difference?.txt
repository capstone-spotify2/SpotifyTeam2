What if I don't recognize their holidays, or pay respect to those who died in wars? 
What if I refuse to resort to violence to solve my conflicts, and if I don't leave it up to their democracy to decide what's best for me? What if I won't beat their cross anymore? 

What if I don't want anything to do with their fucking system? And if I refuse to give myself to the beast that's brought death to millions, killed of countless cultures and raped my earth. If I denounce the system does it make a difference? 

When I turn off the T.V. does it really change the agenda? When I open my mind does it make me any better? What if I refuse to take one drink to sooth the stress, and recognize it for the crutch that it is? Because I won't subscribe to their death does it help to stop the slaughter?
