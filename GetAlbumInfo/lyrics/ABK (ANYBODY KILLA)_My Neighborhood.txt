<i>[ABK]</i>
My neighborhoods full of drama, killas and thugs
Everybodyâs representing by throwing em up
With a quick hi, hello, or beat down baby
Even the cops know the blocks that itâs all time crazy
Itâs alright cause itâs home sweet hood
Even though half of us is up to no good
You gotta love it when you born and raised
In place full of problems that you gotta face
Iâm a native in the city of these Detroit streets
With a warrior mentality that wonât at ease
Tomahawk in one hand, blunt in the other
So I can just get high and swing at motherfuckers
Thatâs how it is, I protect my shit
On my front porch serving up free fat lips
So come and see me if you down to hang
But when you visit in the mix you canât be acting strange

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
My neighborhood ainât what itâs all crack up to be
So much drama

<i>[Boondox]</i>
H-double o-d-c-o-v in the double 7-0 is where you finding me
With that front porch living got that lawn chair high
But donât mistake this lifestyle for a reason to try
Cause itâs a reason to die, we straight country folk bangin
Them dirt road junkies know them country folk slangin
Got that hard, that soft, that prescription for your mentals
My neighborhood homies got them backwoods credentials
Two 4 door chevies, oneâs on blocks, the other pumped out
Bad ass kids leaving grown folkâs punked out
Trailer park cooking serving up that ass
City folkâs cars swerving when them hoes walk past
Because them cornbread booties got em hypnotized
Spending college tuitions just to grip them thighs
My neighborhood to some might seem worlds away
But this is where I stay, Red clay, G-A

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
