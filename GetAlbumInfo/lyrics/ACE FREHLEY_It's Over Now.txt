You were life and love upon this island
And it was hard but you made it all worthwhile
So afraid that I'm gonna run away
Well if I was, I wouldn't be here today, ay
And you took me by the heart
And showed me where I was
Deep inside your love

(You will) Never here me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say
It's over now

I look at you, and I see theres a fear
Something's wrong but your holdin' back your tears
Well here is where I am and where I'll stay
So loose the bad thoughts, push'em far away, ay
Hope and dreams will take the shape
I'm shooting for the stars
And diamonds for your eyes

(You will) Never here me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say
It's over now

(You will) Never here me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say
It's over now
