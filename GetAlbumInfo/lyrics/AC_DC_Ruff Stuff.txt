I like 'em big
And I like 'em small
An' if I had to take the oath
I would take them all
Gimme that ruff stuff
That's what I want

She's a saint, she's a sinner
She's a rave rave rave
She's the one
She's the winner
Every way way way
She don't want love
No cabaret that's out
She like to play it wild
That suits me fine
I like it better when she read my mind
Don't want no woman with a ball and chain
Don't wanna play that game
Just gimme that ruff stuff
I wanna ruff stuff
Baby gimme ruff stuff
If ya don't want ruff stuff
Don't wantcha face round here

Make ya shake, make ya shiver
Make ya pray pray pray
Gonna make you quake, and make you quiver
Turn ya grey grey grey
I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out a touch
They lock me in
I like it better when I pull the pin
And I, don't want no woman with a ball and chain
Don't wanna play that game
Just gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby gimme ruff stuff
If ya don't want ruff stuff
Don't wantcha face round here

I like 'em big
And I like 'em small
And if you ask me to take an oath
I would take them all

Gimme that ruff stuff

Gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby gimme ruff stuff
Baby wanna ruff stuff
Ruff stuff baby
Baby gimme ruff stuff
Takin on the ruff stuff
I want it there
Don't wantcha face round here, I said
Don't wantcha face round here
I don't wantcha face round here
