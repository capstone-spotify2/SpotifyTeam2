You've got that look in your eyes
And I've got plans for 2
Though you're the kinda girl
Who likes to take her time with love
I'd gladly wait forever for you

But in the middle of the night
I know something ain't right
We've got something special girl
Let's give it a try

1 night of touchin
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
Makes 1 night of love

1 night of touchin
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
Makes 1 night of love

You've got that love in your heart
And I've got love for you
But I'm the kinda guy
Who likes to get right to the point
I wanna give my lovin to you

So in the middle of the night
When I'm holdin you tight
I'll show you how precious lovers
Love thru the night

1 night of touchin
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
Makes 1 night of love

1 night of touchin
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
Makes 1 night of love

But in the middle of the night
I know something ain't right
We've got something special girl
Let's give it a try

1 night
Of love
You know you owe it to me
Just 1
Tender touch of loving
And holding
Gimmie your loving

1 night
Of love
You know you owe it to me
Just 1
Tender touch of loving
And holding
Gimmie your loving

1 night of touchin
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
Makes 1 night of love
