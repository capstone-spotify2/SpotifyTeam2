Well, I'm a bird without a sky
I'm a mountain trying to fly
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you

Well, I'm a ship in a desert sea
Well, I'm the only one there for me
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you

Oh, where'd you go?
Oh, you need to know

Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories
That will never die

If I could only turn back time
I would find you and make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you

Well take these eyes and learn to see
That we were always meant to be
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you

Oh, where'd you go?
Oh, you need to know

Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories
That will never die

If I could only turn back time
I would find you and make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

Oh, where'd you go?
Oh, you need to know

Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories
That will never die

If I could only turn back time
Well, I would find you and I'd make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do, yeah
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you, without you, without you
