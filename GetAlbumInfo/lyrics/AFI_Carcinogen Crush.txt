Speechless
Read the words between your lines
In isolation
Silence separates of what design?
I heard you speak
Words I know you didn't write
But I believe you, believe them
'Cause you spoke them again in my dreams last night

I swear to you I'm not the one
I swear so I'll become
Your only desire

Take a bow
You've performed exquisitely
Though the millions scream
I know you'll see
Each subtlety's understood by me

I
I would be as devout
As the high school sweetheart
That I never had, I s-s-s-s-s-s-swear!

I swear to you I'm not the one
I swear so I'll become
Your only
So if you are confined to me
I swear that you will be
So lonely (dreaming)

Your airs of grace, your airs of grace will fill me
Your airs of grace, your airs of grace will fill me
Your airs of grace, your airs of grace will fill me
Your airs of grace, your airs of grace just killed me

Oh!

I swear to you, I'm not the one
I swear so I'll become
Your only
So if you are confined to me
I swear you will be
So lonely (dream-like)

Dream-like
Dream-like
