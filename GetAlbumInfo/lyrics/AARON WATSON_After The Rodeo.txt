Just a worn out truck, a coffee cup
And another night out on the interstate
It's not exactly where he thought he'd be
When he reached this age

There is an old man staring back at him in the rear view
With a million miles of life in his eyes
And makes him ask those questions he don't want to
Oh, but it might be time

Does a shooting star miss the sky
When it hits the ground?
And how long can a woman go on loving you
If you're not around?

The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
After the rodeo

There's a house and eighty acres he calls home
When he's not on the road
And a woman who's been true to him so long
But lonely, sure gets old

Lately he's been thinking 'bout her all the time
And on nights like this he'll miss her most of all
His body and his mind knows that he needs to find
A softer place to fall

Does a shooting star miss the sky
When it hits the ground?
And how long can a woman go on loving you
If you're not around?

The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
After the rodeo
Lord, I wonder where old cowboys go
