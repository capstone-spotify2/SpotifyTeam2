<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh! oh!
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

<i>[Derek:]</i>
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
<i>[?]</i> Travie, I could handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to- used to- used to- used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

<i>[Derek &amp; Alex G:]</i>
If I could only used a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
<i>[Derek:]</i>
Keep it stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh! oh!
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! To my stereo
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! So sing along to my stereo
Let's go

<i>[Alex G:]</i>
If I wasn't old school, fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hands
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh! oh!
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo
