Another lousy night
Out on the tiles again
Tired of the routine
I never ever get it right

I've been lookin' for some action
To divert my attention
Got no rhyme or a reason
Feel the sign, feel the time, the time of the season

Tonight I'm gonna make the grade
Out of the cold nothing can stop
Nothing gonna stop me now - no!

I know I need chain reactions
I know I need heavy action
I know I need chain reactions
All I'm lookin' for is the life's attractions - yeah!

Another boring day
I couldn't take no more
Turnin' down the blue mood
As long as I'm runnin' with the pack I know I'm free

Tonight I'm gonna make the grade
Out of the cold nothing can stop
Nothing can stop me now - no!

Chain reactions

I know I need chain reactions
I know I need heavy action
I know I need chain reactions
I know I need heavy action

Chain reactions - Life atraction
