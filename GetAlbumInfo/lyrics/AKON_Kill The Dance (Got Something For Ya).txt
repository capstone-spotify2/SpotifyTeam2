<i>[Verse 2: Akon]</i>
Represent convict music, Akon (Who dat?) A.K
Recognize bwoy we don't play
Do it like this each and every day (Uh huh!)
So please stay in your place
Hate to find you with no face
Better yet gone with no trace
Other words please don't start no beef
Now sip on your Chardonnay
If the girls tipsy then fade away
I can tell that you wanna play
Cause it's written all over your face
From here it's back to the block
(Uh huh!) Hopefully not back to the glock
(Uh huh!) Got it made up but what if them cop
If I don't get popped by them crooked a** cops, no!

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
Always around when u call
Always around leave the fun
Turn around sh**'s enough
Believe me 'dey wont get funk
C'mon i got something for ya (GUNSHOT)
C'mon i got something for ya (GUNSHOT)
C'mon i got something for ya (GUNSHOT)
C'mon i got something for ya
