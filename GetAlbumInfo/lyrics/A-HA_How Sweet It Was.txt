Uh...yeah, that's alright
Lend us a voice in this howling night

Just about a month ago
You made a promise, babe
Not to go
Yes, you did now
You were the heart and soul

One to the nightfall
One to the stars
One to the haunted fools we are
One to remember
One to recall
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was, yeah

Just about a month ago
You make a promise
Ain't that so
Yes, you did now
Into this howling night

You got
You got 
You got
You got me so
You got me so low

I wouldn't lie, babe - not again
It's such a crime 
To while away my time
Little babe

One to remember
One to recall
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was
We were so happy 
We were okay
We let our good thing, honey
Just slip away

Lend us a voice in this howling 
night
