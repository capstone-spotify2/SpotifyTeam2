Bodies left to rot
But we are only looking in each other's eyes
Love has made us blind
I'm your focus now and baby, you are mine
The world could end right here tonight
Bodies left to rot
But we are only looking in each other's eyes

When the sun goes down, we shine like gold
Yeah, we light up, light up
Summer's running out, so don't let go
Hold me tighter, tighter
We should love like it's the last time
Like we're the only ones beneath this starry sky
Right here in this crowd, let's lose control
Baby, like we're alone

Come on, say my name
Like these velvet days ain't ever gonna fade
Hold me to the flame
Cause tomorrow, we won't get a chance again
Want you to lie right to my face
Come on, say my name
Like these velvet days ain't ever gonna fade

When the sun goes down, we shine like gold
Yeah, we light up, light up
Summer's running out, so don't let go
Hold me tighter, tighter
We should love like it's the last time
Like we're the only ones beneath this starry sky
Right here in this crowd, let's lose control
Baby, like we're alone
