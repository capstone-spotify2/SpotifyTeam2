What's the matter, baby
Why you being so cold-hearted lately?
Oh, what, can't you see I'm aching when you turn your back on me?
Why you acting shady?
How come you never appreciate me?
Don't lie, this is so frustrating when you play the game on me
See, I've been doing everything I can just to make you feel all right
And everytime you went down, I became your guiding light
Tell me, who had your back during all lonely nights that you cried?
I was there to provide when you went through the struggle and strife

Hey, Mr. Replay, I like your inner vision
But there's too much competition for me
Hey, Mr. Replay, ease up and try to listen
You're not on television
This bird has flown away

Na na na...You're lost in your illusion

What's the matter baby?
Let me know if your love is fading
Oh, my God, you drive me crazy when you turn your back on me
I've been contemplating, trying to see why our love is shaky
I cry, if you will betray me
Can't you see (how hard I try?)
See, I've been doing everything I can just to make you feel all right
Everytime you went down, I became your guiding light
Tell me, who had your back during all lonely nights that you cried?
I was there to provide when you went through the struggle and strife

Hey, Mr. Replay, I like your inner vision
But there's too much competition for me
Hey, Mr. Replay, ease up and try to listen
You're not on television
This bird has flown away

Na na na...You're lost in your illusion
Na na na...In your (inner great) confusion, this bird has flown away

(It's my way, such a wonderful play)
Nothing's gonna last forever
We will never stay together
(It's my fate that you will follow one day)
Nothing's gonna last forever, forever

Hey, Mr. Replay, I like your inner vision
But there's too much competition for me
Hey, Mr. Replay, ease up and try to listen
You're not on television
But there's too much competition

Na na na...you're lost in your illusion
Na na na...in your (inner great) confusion, this bird has flown away
