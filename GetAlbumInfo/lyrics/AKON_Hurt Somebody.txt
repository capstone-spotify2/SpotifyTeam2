<i>[Chorus:]</i>
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit

I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody

My momma need a crib
Son needs some Jordans
This some bullshit, cause I can't afford them
Feds listening
And the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen
Hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot
Man I'm talking scorching
Watching bodies drop
Trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top
Trying to stick my fork and
Wanna own the block
Then you gotta put your work in

Cause

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit

I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody

<i>[French Montana:]</i>
<i>[?]</i> instead of calling
Dreaming out the sale, tell me wake up in the morning
Magic warp, always disappears
Smoked and my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Hot head, but this concrete cold
Titanium bitch I never follow
Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain't got to help me
Nigga help yourself
They got me up in here
I don't know what they're talking
Well tell them I'm the mob
I don't own them
I'll take the sugar sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I'll tear your ass apart and put you out of order

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
