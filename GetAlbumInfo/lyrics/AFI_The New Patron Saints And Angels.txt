I've seen the light that emanates from you,
and it makes me feel proud, a voice of reason above the muffling crowds.
Such will to live and you've got so much to give, long lost sincerity. 
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black.
Lost in myself until I finally find. 
A guide in you, and gratitude is mine, I admire the way you shine.
Stare down the day from which others shield their eyes, 
with complete clarity, and no trace of apathy. 
So positive, and your heart you freely give, long lost vivacity. 
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black.
Lost in myself until I finally find. 
A guide in you, and gratitude is mine, I admire the way you shine.
