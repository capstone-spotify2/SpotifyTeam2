I've got cruel intentions
I'm not gonna lie to you (you oh)
You don't make it easy
But I'm gonna get to you (you oh)

I've waited long enough to know (oh oh oh oh)
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I don't know what you see in me (oh oh oh oh)
But I don't even care at all

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
Cause I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time
I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time (time)

I'm not thinking clearly
No matter what I do (do oh)
You never make it easy
I'm good at the game but you're playing it too

I've waited long enough to know (oh oh oh oh)
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I don't know what you see in me (oh oh oh oh)
But I don't even care at all

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
Cause I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time
I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time (time)

I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time (time)
I have no clue
How I'm with you
And I started to realize
I've been brain dead all this time (time)

I have no clue (I don't know what you see in me)
How I'm with you (I'm ready to go, ready to go)
And I started to realize (I've waited long enough to know)
I've been brain dead all this time (time)
