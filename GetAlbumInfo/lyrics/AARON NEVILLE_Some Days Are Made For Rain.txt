We held each other 'til the moon was high
We waved that sleepy little town good bye
And driving off together we crossed our hearts
Living for the promise that love would keep us honest
I said I'd be yours if you'd be mine
We were crazy baby
And every day the sun was sure to shine
But it tried and tried
Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain

We fixed a tire and we drove like hell
We kissed like fire in a cheap motel
I never felt the hunger so bad before
Holding you beside me
Walls came down inside me
And I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
I was sure the sun would always shine
But it tried and tried

Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain

You want to talk about love
I'll tell you all about love
Nothing but trouble
On top of falling
One day you're walking on air
Next day you look and there's no one there
She never cared
She never cared

Now I've been sleeping with the tv on
I get so tired of wondering where you've gone
You tore across my heart across like a hurricane
I'm counting up the damage
Trying hard to manage
I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
And I was sure the sun would always shine
But take a look outside
Sometimes a wind makes a sudden change
Here comes those clouds and they're full of pain
Some days are made for rain
Some days are made for rain

Let it pour outside
Some days are made for rain

Some days are made for rain
