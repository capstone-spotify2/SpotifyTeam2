You make my dreams come true
And I love all the small things that you do,
Like blink 182
You make my days go better and the way
That the sun is shining through girl it's all because of you

And I know it's tough right now but you'll get it together
And just know that I am here through all kinds of weather
I won't ever leave your side day or night or whenever
But right now I just gotta say
I just gotta say

But you're a
Showstopper you are so hot and I can't get you off my mind
Showstopper you're a jaw dropper
When I see you in the lights
You make everything alright
And I know that Id be fine if I had you

You make me wanna dance
Cause I'm happy but just know that I can't dance
So I'm sorry in advance
And

You make the stars shine brighter and the way
That the moonlight hits your eyes makes me wanna be your guy
And I know it's tough right now now but we'll get it together
And just know that I am here through all kinds of weather
And I will ever leave your side day or night or whenever
But at this moment I just wanna say, I just gotta say

That you're a
Showstopper you are so hot and I can't get you off my mind
Showstopper you're a jaw dropper
When I see you in the lights
You make everything alright
And I know that Id be fine if I had you

And you make me feel like I'm flying
And no one can stop me from feelin
The way I do now there's no denying
That you got me goin and now I'm falling

Showstopper you are so hot and I can't get you off my mind
Showstopper you're a jaw dropper
When I see you in the lights
You make everything alright
And I know that Id be fine if I had you

Showstopper you are so hot and I can't get you off my mind
