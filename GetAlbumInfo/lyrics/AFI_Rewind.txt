Lie awake, keep your cold eyes closed
Feel it crawl upon your chest
Bear it's teeth and steal your breath
Stay awake as its creeping close
If you're brave enough you'll see
As it stares it looks a lot like me
It looks like me

Though there's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way to apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now. We rewind

Draw a line that cannot be crossed
Make a circle out of salt
Knowing it was all your fault
Hide inside, call your doting dogs
As their weak servility
Feeds your emptiness, remember me
In solitude you will sense me

Though there's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way to apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now. We rewind

Forever feel it as it's gnawing
Forever crawling, ever crawling
Never caring always smiling
Here to feed when you are falling

There's no way I will materialize
Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you
There's no way, you can't apologize
Your selfish words must float denied like your crime
I float now. We rewind
We rewind
I float now, forever
You did this. We rewind
