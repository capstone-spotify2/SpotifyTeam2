Have you ever actually seen yourself without a mirror?

To slip through the cracks of the universe, my love so true, is my gift to you

Trapped in a world that was dreamt by a madman, hallelujah! hallelujah!
Little did he know his dreams would come true
Iâm on to you! Iâm on to you!

Think, if only he could see the gorgeous rage
Then maybe he would never have bled ink on page
An artist, he was so consumed by a world he saw in his mind
a world sadistic with lies and panicking cries

Our world is so callous and cold, empty and lost
Iâll bleed for you, to change it all, Iâll die for you to save us all
This could be our only chance
This could be our only hope

Lost in your passion, endless attraction, forever yours
You make me feel like Iâm invincible
Love sings such a sweet ending
Ballad of lust, anticipate the irresistible

Changing the end means going back to where it all began
If we survive we take control and start again
Youâve lost your mind, tear the fabric of time itself?!
Stay close to me, I will rewrite history for you

Our world is so callous and cold, empty and lost
Iâll bleed for you, to change it all, Iâll die for you to save us all
This could be our only chance
This could be our only hope

Lost in your passion, endless attraction, forever yours
You make me feel like Iâm invincible
Love sings such a sweet ending
Ballad of lust, anticipate the irresistible

As your hand drifts from mine
Two hearts still intertwined
Across both space and time
Remember I am yours
I am yours
Remember I am yours

Time seizes my hand
Only a fool is never afraid

Lost in your passion, endless attraction, forever yours
You make me feel like Iâm invincible
Love sings such a sweet ending
Ballad of lust, anticipate the irresistible
Forever yours, irresistible
Forever yours, you make me feel like Iâm invincible

Annabel please donât go
Iâll be fine, weâll be fine
