I'll hold you close tonight
I won't let go until you're sure
You're not alone
Now don't you hold your tears inside
I'll never judge you
Or make you feel less of a man

Let me be the one to come running
Cradle you from harm
When you're running away

Darling just hold me
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me tonight
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me
My darling just hold me
Hold me tonight

Don't you hide your face tonight
You're beautiful
And I can see it clearly now
And I'll be late I know
But time can wait
How I need you baby
Feel your sorrow

Let me be the one to come running
Cradle you from harm
When you're running away

Darling just hold me
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me tonight
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me
My darling just hold me
Hold me tonight

Don't be scared honey
To open up
My baby
And be honest with me
When you need some help
Need some help
Cause when times get rough
You know I'll be there waiting
Cause when times get rough
You know the going get tough

Darling just hold me
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me tonight
Darling just hold me
Why won't you hold me
My darling just hold me
Hold me tonight
