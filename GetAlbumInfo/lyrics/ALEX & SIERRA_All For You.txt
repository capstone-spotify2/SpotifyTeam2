Here I go
Another night I find myself losing all control
You won't believe what I've been thinking

Wanna rob a bank
Get you everything you could ever need
Steal a plane and fly you wherever you want

(You never know when to stop)
It's the way you keep me twisted
It's just how I like it to be
(You never know when to stop)
So if you wake up and see me on the news
I did it all for you
I did it all for you

There you go
Love to cause trouble, I don't think you know
Just how close I've been to doing the same

Wanna steal your favorite car
Drive every mile 'til we pop the tires
No jail bars are ever keeping us apart

(You never know when to stop)
It's the way you keep me twisted
It's just how I like it to be
(You never know when to stop)
So if you wake up and see me on the news
I did it all for you
I did it all for you

They're coming to get us so we better run
Are we gonna pay for the things that we've done?
They're coming to get us so we better run

They're coming to get us so we better run
Are we gonna pay for the things that we've done?
They're coming to get us so we better run

I did it all for you
I did it all for you
I did it all for you
I did it all for you
For you, for you, for you

I did it all for you
I did it all for you
