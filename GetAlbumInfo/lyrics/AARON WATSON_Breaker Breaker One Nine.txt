Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
That my heart is breaking and this big ol' rig is shaking
I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her

Well she packed her bags and rented a U-Haul
Unhitched my heart hit the road around nightfall
Now I'm throwin hubs and speeding out of control
She never said where she was going but she said where I could go

Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
That my heart is breaking but I don't smell no bacon
So I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her

Well we took that big trip on down the aisle
Everything was hunky dory for a while
Now this Detroit is winding, my mind is grinding gears
I can hardly see the road with this truck load of tears

Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
I've got Smokey on my tail and unless I go to jail
I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her
