Alone in the dark, hole in my heart, turn on the radio
And the words fall out, but they got no place to go
Wasted on you, high on the fumes
Know I should let you go
But the world won't stop
And all I got is your ghost, oh, oh oh

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life

No time to sleep, all that I see, are old memories of you
Yeah I try my best, but there's no one left for me to lose
Tear in my eye, I drive through the night, as far as I can from you
And I don't give a fuck if the sun comes up, yeah
It's just another

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life

No I don't give a fuck if the sun comes up, yeah
It's just another

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life
