Give me a second I,
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover sheâs waiting for me just across the bar
My seatâs been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know youâre trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
Iâm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
Iâll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that Iâm not
All that you've got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
âCause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So letâs set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
Iâll carry you home tonight
