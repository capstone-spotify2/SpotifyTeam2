And then I make wish
I make it on eagle's wings
And when I say a prayer
I pray for peace, pray for peace 

Nothing happens if you don't try
When nothing happens, that's the reason why

Hey, when I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
Hey, when I woke up today (up today)

And when I look into the faces of children
I see perfect love
And when I pray to my God in heaven
I pray for peace, pray for peace 

Nothing happens if you don't try
When nothing happens, that's the reason why 

Hey, when I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
Hey oh, when I woke up today

La-La, la-di-di-di-da, I think it's time for a change
When I was young I played, I had lots of fun
But now I can see it's time for a change
The time is right
We gotta put up a fight
And bring about some changes 

When I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
When I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
When I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
When I woke up today
I thought I could change the world 

When I woke up today
