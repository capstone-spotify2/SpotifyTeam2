People are watchin'!
But we don't care
The way I am touchin' your body
Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
See I met her at club on a Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seen her comin' my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her (oh-ooh)
I didn't see a ring on her finger
Asked her did you ever been with a singer before
She said no (oh-ohh)
So let me introduce you to my world
These diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
(I got that type of)
That you ain't never seen before
It's all around the world
I got 'em coming back for more
That's when I noticed

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
People are watchin'!
But we don't care
The way I am touchin' your body
Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hemmed up trapped in the corner
Grindin' slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh)
Baby more iller than ammonia
Feelin' tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-noo)
I think she 'bout to let go (oh-ooh)
She said she wants to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get a taste
I'll be comin' right back for more
And that's when I noticed

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
People are watching!
But we don't care
The way I'm touchin' your body
Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
Like we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me goin'... Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
We dancin' together like we belong in my bedroom
(In and out the sheets what we doin' it on the dance floor)
If we shared mattresses you'd leave me no head room
(Loose as one can be and she's flaunting it, damn it's hardcore)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
People are watching!
We don't care
The way I'm touching your body
Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me going... Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
