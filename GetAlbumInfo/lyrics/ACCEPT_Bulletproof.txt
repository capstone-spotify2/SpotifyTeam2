He called it this - he called it that
But never what it was
We called it shit - we called it grass
That's the way it was
He took it once - just for the thrill
He'd bought a ticket to ride

We laughed about - the jokes he told
He was one of the boys
Hey, what a guy - he used to be
When he was sober and dry

Smokey nights - Gloomy lights
He was high as a kite
When he turned into a demon
No way to calm him down
Just like a Jekyl and Hyde

He wasn't bulletproof
Shot himself the final round
No man is bulletproof
It's destination underground
Too many jouneys - on acid trains
Too many trips - on the astral plane

Danced with Lucy in the sky
On a cloud of ecstasy
Too late to stop him now
Even sacrifice his mother
Turn against his only friend
To reach the ultimate high

He wasn't bulletproof
He shot himself the final round
No man is bulletproof
It's destination underground
Bulletproof
The chief is your medicine-man
No man is bulletproof
He's gonna drug you down

He thought that he could fly
That he could reach the sky
But he went up too high - oh, so high
He kissed the ground - goodbye

He wasn't bulletproof
He shot himself the final round
No man is bulletproof
Destination underground
Bulletproof
The chief is your medicine-man
No man is bulletproof
He's gonna drug you down
