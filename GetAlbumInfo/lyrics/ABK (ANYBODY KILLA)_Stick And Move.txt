<i>[Violent J]</i>
Mop up the floor with that bullshit 
Cause I'mma stick and move 
I'mma stick and move anybody 
Do anything 
to get what I need 
To take care of me and mine 

<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
Stick and move, outta the way 
Duck ya head, time to pray 
I'm lookin' for anyone who ever doubted 
See me in the streets if ya wanna talk about it 
These days I got nothing but time 
So I'm gonna use it all to chase down what's mine 
Actin' crazy when you know you're soft 
And the only thing hard is that shit you talk 
You ever seen a redskin get tipsy 
Then take it to the old school 1850 
Arrow stuck in the back of ya neck 
Just because ya mama raised you to disrespect 
New game means whole new rules 
And I guarantee ya'll that I will not lose 
I guess I'm gonna take ya back to my roots 
Warriors stand up and let's get these fools 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya 

Ha ha! That's what I'm talkin' about 
Stick and move like a heavyweight knockin' you out 
What you thinkin' about 
when you runnin' your mouth 
Tellin' people that you know me like you live in my house 
Things like that, I won't take 
I'mma grown ass man ya best get that straight 
All I do is roll state to state 
So I can look into the eyes of those who relate 
So if you comin' with me then let's go 
We gonna make it more hype than the night before 
Just a bit more out of control 
So learn to live a little and watch your life grow 
Don't mean to steer you wrong 
But when you're livin' in the ghetto, life don't seem long 
Stick and move, move and stick 
Cause second chances don't come that quick 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya 

Come stick and move with me 
right through the industry 
come stick and move with me 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 

Let's say this was a game of tag 
Will ya hide and go get whatever made ya mad? 
I see you, can you see me? 
Even though I stick and move through the industry 
Skip back, play it again 
We should all represent our race 
Open your eyes, cause what you want 
Is staring you right in your face 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya
