I don't know the reason
Let's just make a choice
Let's throw out the caution
Just want hear voice

So walk me through
Back through the fields
When I walked down
That road I find
I already know
On with the show
If there's a God
Then God only knows
Walk me back through
Fields I knew

So when
Like when we believed
A moment in time
When we shined
So walk me through
Back through the fields
Oh take me home
Back to the fields
Erase the dream
Rewrite the scene
If there's a God,
Then God only knows
What we should know
On with the show

Ohh, ooaahh,
Ooaahh, oaah,
Oaaaooahh, oaaooaahhoahh,
Ooaahah, oooahh,
Oaaah, oaaah,
Oaahahhaa, oaaahhhh,
Oaaaaahh, oaaahh,
Oaaahhahhahh
