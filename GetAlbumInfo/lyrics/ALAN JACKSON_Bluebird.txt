I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
And desolation wanes
Like a fog
The fires rolling in
In the wind

I'm out in the rain
The moon is gone behind the clouds again
And I can't stand to live
Another day
Cause my bluebird went away

And I'm locked in this room
With my song
No escape
No way to get away

And my only connection
with tomorrow
Is hopin' that you might decide not to stay away

Well I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way is too much to bear
Can't find my bluebird anywhere

I'm out in the rain
The moon is gone behind the clouds again
And I can't stand to live another day
Bluebird why'd you go away?
Bluebird why'd you go away?
