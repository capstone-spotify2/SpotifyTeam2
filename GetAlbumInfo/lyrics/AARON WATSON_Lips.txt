Girl you donât have to get dolled up, old T-shirt on you, will do just fine.
Besides, you know nothing stays on you too long, once youâre in these arms of mine.
And Iâve seen you pretty in pink, Iâve seen you beautiful in blue.
I have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 

So lay back baby and close your eyes. Let me run my fingers through your hair,
Soft kisses down the side of your neck, and we both know where it goes from there.
Girl even after all these years, lovin you still feels brand new, I just have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 

That cotton dress that you wore tonight looked amazing on you, and thatâs for sure.
And not as good as it does right now, lyin there on our bedroom floor.
And I like the way I make you blush, I wanna take you where weâve never been, I wanna whisper in your ear, I wanna taste your sweet skin

So lay back baby and close your eyes. Let me run my fingers through your hair,
Soft kisses down the side of your neck, and we both know where it goes from there.
