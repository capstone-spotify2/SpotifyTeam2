I met this girl from the other side
All kind of pale, dressed in black and white.
She's not the same,
Quite different from any other girlfriend
I've had.

It's like, her touch, it's invisible
Can't get enough, she's insatiable
When she slips in my room,
Then I know I'm on a good thing, not bad.

When I'm alone she appears from no-where
It's so surreal, makes me feel I don't wanna care.

I love it when she walks right though me
I wanna feel her cold touch on my skin
She doesn't mind if I can't see her tonight
Yeah, I know I'm alright.

Her complexion, it's so timeless
She's like a gothic lady princess.
I never thought I'd be with a supernatural kind of girl
Like her.

When I'm alone she appears from no-where
It's so surreal, makes me feel I don't wanna care.

I love it when she walks right though me
I wanna feel her cold touch on my skin
She doesn't mind if I can't see her tonight

Yeah, I know I'm alright.

I ain't getting no sleep
Situation's unique
This girl, she's so incredible
When she takes off her clothes
Then I know that it's only me that knows.

I love it when she walks right though me
I wanna feel her cold touch on my skin
She doesn't mind if I can't see her tonight

I love it when she walks right through me.
