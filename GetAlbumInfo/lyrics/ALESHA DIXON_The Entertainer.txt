Let the lights light up 
Let the cold get Warm (Warm up) 
You think you've had it all 
But you ain't had anything before 
had anything before 
Eye line is like a soldier 
I'm military every move is Solar 
Put it on a guarantee 
That you ain't never seen nothing like me 
seen nothing like me 

Make you laugh along, I'll sing your song we can go go 
You wanna piece of the pie, Mr Diamond Eye 
What you wanna know 
Come In a little bit closer, I'm not a poster through your window 
I'm the Real thing 
Ladies and Gentleman introducing 

I'm the Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Each time I begin I perform 'till the end 
I'm the Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Entertainer (Entertainer) 
When I win you round I'll take my Bow 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha, 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha 

Keep the peace, a leap of faith 
Take a count to 10, from alpha to omega 
Close your eyes baby don't blink blink blink 
Baby don't you think think think 
I'm the queen of hearts but only yours 
When I take it down and bring you up, ah 
Follow me like a puppet on a string 
Anything I do you'll be doing it again and again and again 

Make you laugh along, I'll sing your song we can go go 
You wanna piece of the pie, Mr Diamond Eye 
What you wanna know 
Come In a little bit closer, I'm not a poster through your window 
I'm the Real thing 
Ladies and Gentleman introducing 

I'm the Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Each time I begin I perform 'till the end 
I'm the Entertainer (Entertainer) 
Entertainer (Entertainer) 
When I win you round I'll take my Bow 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha 
I'm the Entertainer ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha 

I'm the enter....

Gonna Make you want more, gonna make
