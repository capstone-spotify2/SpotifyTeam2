All was right
We were one
You were my everything
So in love
Now I've learned
That You weren't there
How could I be so blind for you

Well I seen it in your face
That you were on a date
Girl I should've known, you started comin in so late
Someone else had said
That I had been misled
Till the day our kid found you in someone else's bed

Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more
Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more

All I know
Is you were wrong
But still I could forgive
I stayed strong
Till one day
He came by
And said our family
Was all a lie

Well I couldn't believe my ears
What he was tellin me
So I went to call the doctors
Cause I just had to see
Well He really rocked my world
You know good and well he did
Cause you knew all the time
That you had someone's kid

Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more
Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more
<i>[x4]</i>

Oh! Oh! Oh! Girl
Girl I've had it
You could have had the decency
To tell the child if not just me
Oh! Oh! Oh! Girl
Girl Forget it
Girl I'm walking out that door
You can't come this way no more

No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No

Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more
Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see yo face no more
