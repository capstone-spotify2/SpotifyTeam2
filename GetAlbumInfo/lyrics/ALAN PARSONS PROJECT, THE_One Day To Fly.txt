Where does a dream belong
Locked in the mind on the edge of time
Like a ship lost in a storm
How do we find the key
Longing to see, through the artist's eye
Maybe only birds can fly

The man must be insane who knows
A mind alive with images so strange
So close but never rode the sky

Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why
Picturing wings held together with string
One day to fly

Someone said and I believe
Try if you dare, you can walk on air
A dream is all you need
A circle that takes you high
Lighter than air as the Earth goes by
Through a spiral in the sky

The man must be insane who knows
A mind alive with images so strange
So close but never rode the sky

Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why
Picturing wings held together with string

Just a charcoal sketch on canvas
Made them laugh but now they see
That the artist had a vision
That the wind could set us free
It's a bridge until tomorrow
Taking us beyond the sun
As the artist paints his picture
The story's just begun

Analyzing, criticizing
Fear of the unknown
Theorizing, visualizing
The road to take us home
If it takes forever
Someone's gonna fly
We may never get to heaven
But still we're gonna try

Watching the birds
As they sail on the wind
One day to fly
