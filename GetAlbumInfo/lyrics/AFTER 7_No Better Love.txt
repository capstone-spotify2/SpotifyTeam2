time and time again, 
I tell you there's no better love, 
than I give you. No
matter where you go, or who you love, 
you'll never find a love like mine

Lately I've been so, into you 
I cant begin to let you know
Sweet heart, I want to show you 
that I can be more than you've ever had before

Make you my everything, and you'll have one hell of a man
I'll prove to you that I am down with you girl
Put diamond rings on your hands
Just let me know where we stand 
and I'll be there to care girl I promise baby

There is just no better love
You'll never find a love, 
who'll give you all the joy
and all the things I do.
There is just no better love, 
you can not get enough of my lovin' kissin' and huggin' 

Girl you know I can not live without you for a day in my life
no, I want you to be my wife
Girl if we were ever apart 
I'd be a lonely man, with no one else to hold on

It was deep in my heart
to tell you the real 
if you would only feel what I'm feelin' baby
just bear with me now, 
I'm here for your love and I'll be there to care girl
I promise baby

There is just no better love
You'll never find a love, 
who'll give you all the joy
and all the things I do.
There is just no better love, 
you can not get enough of my lovin' kissin' and huggin' 

There is no love no love baby, 
better than my lovin' sugar
right on time when you need it
blow your mind little sweetie
no love baby no love

There is just no better love
You'll never find a love, 
who'll give you all the joy
and all the things I do.
There is just no better love, 
you can not get enough of my lovin' kissin' and huggin'
