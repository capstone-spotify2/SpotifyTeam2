Poverty loses its grip
Race can no longer divide
Wherever your spirit is
Every darkness dies
Freedom is here with us
Burdens will fall like chains
Beauty will rise from the dust
All that's lost will be regained

You redeem, You redeem
You restore what's been stolen from me
You reclaim, You release
You rebuild with the words that You breathe
You redeem

Mercy will pour down like rain
Justice will come for the weak
Lies that were meant to defame
Will be crushed by the the truth that you speak

You redeem, You redeem
You restore what's been stolen from me
You reclaim, You release
You rebuild with the words that You breathe
You redeem

Miracles will happen
Healing will come
The plans of our enemy ruined undone
Miracles will happen
Healing will come
Here in your presence lost in Your Love
Miracles will happen
Healing will come
The plans of our enemy ruined undone
Miracles will happen
Healing will come
Wrecked by Your presence I'm lost in Your Love

You redeem, You redeem
You restore what's been stolen from me
You reclaim, You release
You rebuild with the words that You breathe
You redeem, You redeem
Let Your revival awaken me
You reclaim, You release
You rebuild what's been broken in me
You redeem
You redeem
