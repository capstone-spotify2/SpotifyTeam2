Got too many chains on me
These niggas changed on me
They up and changed on me (swear)

<i>[Hook:]</i>
These niggas changed on me
I swear they up and changed on me
Shit ain't been the same homie
Ever since I seen the fame homie
And they ain't did a thang homie
I just put a couple chains on me
Now they hate to put the blame on me
You had to spit in niggas chain homie (hey)

This what you niggas expect of me
They tryin' to drain all my energy
Countin' me out of this industry
Now they know I got the recipe
Count up the money then blow a check
How bout my mamma write all the checks
Niggas, they act like they want some
Fuck 'em I won't even send a text (wooh)
You see the look on they faces, these niggas' jealous
My mamma called me and told me "Oh baby be careful"
But they better not play with me
Next thing you know you'll be put on a shirt that say "In love and memory"
Guess who that back on that gutta shit
Might hit the block in them other shit
Watch all them niggas you kick it with
They may not be who you think they is
I thought it'd never be; used to be homies, now enemies
I know it is what it is but I gotta live, so fuck if you mad at me

I got way too many chains on me
I got way too many chains on me
I got way too many chains on me
Oh, I got way too many chains on

Hate is a weak emotion
Killin' 'em, my condolence
My president Rollie is drippin' all on me
And no I have never voted
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Cause they want a hand out
They wanna finish me, do me like Kennedy
Hit with a headshot
Told me I'd never be shit
But now that the story begins
Gettin' some head in the Benz
And I make her call up her friend
She do whatever for daddy
I do what I gotta to win
One hitters wonderin' how the fuck that nigga did it again
Again and again, count up the money to count it again
I cannot pretend, I see them fake through my Cartier lens
Better be, most of these niggas afraid of me
Fuck you my only apology
Cause I am the one you will never be
