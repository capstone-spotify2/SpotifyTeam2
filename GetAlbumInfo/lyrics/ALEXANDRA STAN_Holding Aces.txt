I'll built a house of cards, if that's your game
Think I'm innocent but I'm down to play you
Picture my eyes rolling like dice until the morning comes
Fall in between, King and a Queen, laid on your 21

I don't even know who you are
Who the hell do you think that you are?!
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Just 'cause I don't give a smile
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces

Show me what you've got, I'll let you in
You could turn it up, or go all in, yeah
Turn off the lights, boy flame your ride until the morning comes
Fall in between, King and a Queen, laid on your 21

I don't even know who you are
Who the hell do you think that you are?!
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Just 'cause I don't give a smile
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces

Just fall on me into the dark
Cause all we have is here right now
No, we don't need to settle down tonight

I don't even know who you are
Who the hell do you think that you are?!
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces

I don't even know who you are
Who the hell do you think that you are?!
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Just 'cause I don't give a smile
Don't mistake these pretty faces
I'm holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces
Eeey eey eey
Holding aces
Holding aces
