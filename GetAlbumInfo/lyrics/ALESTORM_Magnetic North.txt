The snow fell hard on a frozen sea
As the night swarmed all around
With no moon to guide our passage north
This corpse of mine may never be found
Thirty days, into this dead mans quest
In search of riches in a time-lost treasure chest
Through oceans never seen, through fog as thick as night
To the northern wastelands, onwards we must fight
Far beyond the ice and snow
Our voyage carries on
For blood and gold, we sold our souls
Redemption lies at Magnetic North
Set the course for Magnetic North
Beyond the snow to Magnetic North
On the quest for Magnetic North
We will die at Magnetic North
Sold a lie, condemned to die
Empty promise encased in ice
One by one, our time has come
Death awaits before the sun
The snow fell hard on a frozen sea
As the sun rose to the sky
Trapped forever in the sea of ice
This is the place where we will die
Far beyond the ice and snow
Our voyage carries on
For blood and gold, we sold our souls
Redemption lies at Magnetic North
Set the course for Magnetic North
Beyond the snow to Magnetic North
On the quest for Magnetic North
We will die at Magnetic North
