If you can't stand upon the water I will see you on the ocean floor.
When you blink do you only find the misery between the lines?
Then take my hand and walk with me.
Come to me, your sanctuary,
I'll gladly accept the gift that I've been granted.
If you feel fine, then give it just a little time.
I'm sure you'll contract my disease.

Look what you've done to me now,
You've made me perfect.
Look what you've done to me now.

If you can't stand upon the earth then I see you on the other side.
When you blink do you only find the misery weighs down your eyes?
Then take my hand and sleep with me.

Look what you've done to me now,
You've made me perfect.
Look what you've done to me now.

Take my hand, I'll be everything to you.
Take my hand, I'll take everything from you.
I will seep under your skin.
I will.
I will hold onto your heart.
I will. 

Look what you've done to me now,
You've made me perfect.
Look what you've done to me now.
Look what you've done to me now,
You've made me perfect.
Look what you've done to me now.

What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
Done
