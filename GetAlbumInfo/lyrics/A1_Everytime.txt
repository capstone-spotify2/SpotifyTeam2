<i>[MARK:]</i> LATELY I'M NOT WHO I USED TO BE
SOMEONE'S COME AND TAKEN ME
WHERE I DON'T WANNA GO
IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO
IN ORDER TO BE THERE FOR YOU
WHEN YOU WERE FEELING LOW

<i>[BEN:]</i> AND ALL THE THINGS WE EVER WANTED
WERE ONCE YOURS AND MINE
NOW, I KNOW WE CAN REVIVE IT
ALL THE LOVE WE LEFT

<i>[PAUL:]</i> EVERYTIME I KISS I FEEL YOUR LIPS AND
EVERYTIME I CRY I SEE YOUR SMILE AND
EVERYTIME I CLOSE MY EYES I REALISE THAT
EVERYTIME I HOLD YOUR HAND IN MINE
THE SWEETEST THING MY HEART COULD EVER FIND
AND I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
SINCE THE DAY I GAVE YOUR LOVE AWAY

<i>[CHRISTIAN:]</i> SAVE ME, I'VE FALLEN FROM MY DESTINY
YOU AND I WERE MEANT TO BE
I'VE THROWN IT ALL AWAY
NOW YOU'RE GONE
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO CARRY ON
BUT BABY I JUST CAN'T GO ON
WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE

<i>[BEN:]</i> AND ALL THE THINGS WE EVER WANTED
WERE ONCE YOURS AND MINE
NOW, I KNOW WE CAN REVIVE IT
ALL THE LOVE WE LEFT

<i>[PAUL:]</i> EVERYTIME I KISS I FEEL YOUR LIPS AND
EVERYTIME I CRY I SEE YOUR SMILE AND
EVERYTIME I CLOSE MY EYES I REALISE THAT
EVERYTIME I HOLD YOUR HAND IN MINE
THE SWEETEST THING MY HEART COULD EVER FIND
AND I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
SINCE THE DAY I GAVE YOUR LOVE AWAY

<i>[BEN:]</i> WE CAN SURVIVE IT
ALL THE PAIN WE FEEL INSIDE
YOU RELIED ON ME AND NOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN
NOW, I PROMISE YOU FOREVER
I WILL BE THE BEST I CAN
NOW, I KNOW WE CAN REVIVE IT
ALL THE LOVE WE LEFT

<i>[PAUL:]</i> EVERYTIME I KISS I FEEL YOUR LIPS AND
EVERYTIME I CRY I SEE YOUR SMILE AND
EVERYTIME I CLOSE MY EYES I REALISE THAT
EVERYTIME I HOLD YOUR HAND IN MINE
THE SWEETEST THING MY HEART COULD EVER FIND
AND I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
SINCE I GAVE YOUR LOVE AWAY

EVERYTIME I KISS I FEEL YOUR LIPS AND
