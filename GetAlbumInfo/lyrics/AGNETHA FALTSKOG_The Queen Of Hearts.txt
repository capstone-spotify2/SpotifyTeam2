So you're losing tonight
Nothing seems to go right
You keep playing the wrong cards, don't you?
Someone's throwing the dice
And you need some advice
So you listen to me now, won't you?
You don't know what's at stake
That your heart's gonna break
If you don't watch yourself tonight

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The Queen of Hearts is back in town
The Queen of Hearts still wears the crown
She does not intend to abdicate
She'll be playing it cool
She'll make you feel like a fool
And you will never know if she will play it straight
The Queen of Hearts is back again
And it's you she wants my friend
You will see how well she knows her game
You're a loser from the very start
Because she deals for your heart

For as long as you know
You've been running the show
Always played at the winning table
Now you know you should leave
There's no ace up your sleeve
But you feel that you are unable
And you know what's at stake
That your heart's gonna break
If you don't watch yourself tonight

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
