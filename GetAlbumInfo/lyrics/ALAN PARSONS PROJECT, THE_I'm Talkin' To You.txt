Somehow you fell out of time
Boy you lost your place in line
But don't even try
To drag me down too
I'm talkin' to you, I'm talkin' to you

One star rises, one falls from the sky
You're still hiding the way you feel inside
One word closer to things we need to say
One cut deeper to tear the past away

You think I don't know your mind
But I know fools don't change with time
Until the warning signs
Come out to the blue
I'm talkin' to you, I'm talkin' to you

One light's burning - another fades away
Don't stand watching your dream go down in flames
One step closer, the door is open wide
Come tomorrow we'll see the other side

On and on until we change
Everything remains the same
On and on until we learn
On and on the wheel will turn ...

Wounded words and eyes that lie
You won't let your demons die
Take a look inside
Or you're gonna lose
I'm talkin' to you, I'm talkin' to you

I'm talkin' to you
Whatever you do, the last laugh's on you

On and on until we change
Everything remains the same
On and on until we learn
On and on the wheel will turn ...

Somehow you fell out of time
Boy you lost your place in line ...
One star rises one star falls
Do you even care at all? ... this time

I'm talkin' to you
I'm talkin' to you
