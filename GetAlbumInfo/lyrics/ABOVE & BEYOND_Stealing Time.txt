I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red eye
And winding down the windows

I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
My future is a Valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime

And as the hours go flashing by
I'm winding down the windows
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die
