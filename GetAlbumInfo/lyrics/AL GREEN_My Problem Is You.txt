Well, I fell beyond the blue
It's just you and me, baby
I, I don't know
Why I can't get over you

Every night it's true
My problem is you, yeah

Early this morning
You were on my mind
Trouble everywhere
But I'm, I'm fine, doin' just fine

That's true
My, my, my, my problem is you
A biggest problem, baby
(My problem is you)

Let me just say that
Every night it's true
My problem is you, yeah
(My problem is you)

Early this morning
You were on my mind
There's trouble everywhere
But I'm doin' just fine

Sure  it's true, babe
I can't seem to get on with you
And my problem is you

Every night is through
My, my biggest problem seemed to be you

And this morning
You were on my mind
There maybe trouble everywhere
But I'm doin' just fine

I know it's true
I, I, I can't seem to get over you
Oh baby, my problem is you

Every night is through
I can't seem to get over you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
My problem is you

I know it's true
I know it's through
Every night it's through
I can't seem to get over you, girl

So long, baby
So long
