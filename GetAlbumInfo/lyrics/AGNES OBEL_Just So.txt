Black turns beamy bright
Turning on the light
Today is gonna be the day
You hear somebody say,
We need you wide awake

Tiptoe over the floor
What are you waiting for?
So so and no more
That's all to be sorry for

Today is gonna be the day
You hear somebody say
We need you wide awake

You hear the minutes kick and play
The order of the day
Is hollering your way

The window shade
The nursing aid
To let it all just work the way
From head to toe
A shadow grows
Since forever and a day

Quiet moments hum
But some do you wrong
Today is gonna be the day
You hear somebody say
We need you wide awake

No time for tea or lemonade
Someone has set the date 
We're only half the way

Drink a toast to the sun
To the things that never come
To the break of the day
That is all I say
