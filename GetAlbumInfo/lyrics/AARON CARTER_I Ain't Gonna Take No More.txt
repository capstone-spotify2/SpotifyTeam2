Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my way
My lady fortune's
Coming to stay
Don't need no bullshit
No mister Big
Don't need no contract
No papers to rig

I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again

I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more

Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my face
You're just a loser
Get off of my case
Can't stand the thunder
Can't keep me down
You're going nowhere
Stop messing around

I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again

I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more

Bad luck and trouble
Are passing me by
Your days are numbered
It's your turn to cry
No time for losers
With nothing to say
Sunshine and blue skies
Are heading my way

I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
