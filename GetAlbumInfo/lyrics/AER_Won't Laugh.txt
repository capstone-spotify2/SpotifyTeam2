<i>[Hook - Dave:]</i>
I wonât laugh if you smile
Fabricated tales tend to take a while
I wonât laugh if you smile
To each his own thats my way, yeah

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
I got tattoos, so people think Iâm cool
College? Iâm better than school
I smoke pot, sâonly thing I do
Now you wonder why I wouldnât trade my life with you
Why?!
Cuz you hang the same keys from the same hook every afternoon
My angels lookin down upon me from a great view, they got my back but they hate you
This all seems so crazy, I swear I never imagined this, remember hittinâ dank in the â94
Protege, didnât think it happen as fast as this, but that was then and this is now
Itâs a different time and a different sound
Saying new things from the same mouth, still a Coch kid in my hometown
From a thought to a hobby to a full time career, 74th floor in Shanghai when it all came clear
In the hills or the valley, and were far from the finale, I want this so badly, no I wonât let go

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Lets meet!, I want you to know me
I grew up in the east, on a quiet street, but Im boutta move out and sign a new lease
Can't feel stuck, Expectations, bills and rent, sâall almost a bit too much
But itâs money well spent, one hundred percent, Iâm someone to trust
I wanna apologize to my old friend for hookinâ up w his girlfriend
I donât wanna get denied from a club for the color of my boysâ skin
But now itâs tours, wake me up, interviews, wake me up
I hate when you expect me to pay for ya
Got friends that seem to hate me now, I guess thatâs just the truth of the matter
Shouldnât be hard to look down as youâre climbing the ladder
I know that we are a difference in the pattern, all your fake talk got me far from flattered

So, run along, run along, I donât wanna see your face here, yeah, donât call it your home
Run along, run along, you gonâ suck em all dry
Run along, run along, cuz we donât no more

<i>[Hook - Dave]</i>

<i>[Outro x4:]</i>
Would you be so kind
Would you be so kind just say it?
