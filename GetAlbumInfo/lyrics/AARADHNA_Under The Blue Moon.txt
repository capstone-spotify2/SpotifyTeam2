As the wind blows
And the sun goes
Down into the dark skies
Iâve been missing my darling
Iâve been missing my darling
Under the blue moon

Leaves in the wind is swept away and scattered
<i>[?]</i>
Iâm hoping 
And Iâm praying 
And Iâm wishing
That itâs true for me and you

Because Iâm patiently waiting
Just sitting you waiting
Under the blue moon <i>[x7]</i>

Feel like Iâm close to you
When I kiss the sky
Iâm dreaming of the love that was in my life, Iâm
Iâm hurting baby
Thereâs a pain in my heart

Because Iâm patiently waiting
Just sitting you waiting
Under the blue moon <i>[x7]</i>

As the wind blows
And the sun goes
Down into the dark skies
Iâve been missing my darling
Iâve been missing my darling
Under the blue moon <i>[x7]</i>

Iâve been patiently waiting
Iâve been missing my darling
