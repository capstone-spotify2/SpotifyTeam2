That's on errrythang

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I see the money come, seen the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sho'
Set the standards high, sit the chewy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no ho from chasing dough
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
See no paper come 'n go just like the weather change
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
Gotta watch these bitches cause they out here playin head games

<i>[Verse 1 - Ace Hood:]</i>
I got a pocket full of that green shit
Get getting head by some bitch who made the dean's list
Head great, talking Tony the Tiger
Ridin in that white Mercedes I call it Delilah
Twenty-fo's
Pigeon toes
Plus the coupe came with a bitch that's from the Poconos
I watch my money come, never see it go
Hit the club and watch me blow it like a saxophone
That's on errrythang, I'm talking errrythang
Told my jeweler I got fifty for my pinky ring
Straight cash, hoppin out that spider thang
Never was no local joker
Don't say AH "I told ya"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I see the money come, seen the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sho'
Set the standards high, sit the chewy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no ho from chasing dough
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
See no paper come 'n go just like the weather change
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
Gotta watch these bitches cause they out here playin head games

<i>[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti:]</i>
I say my family good (family good), my niggas too
I just bought my bitch a Benz and I call her Boo (Boo)
I'm chasin money (I am)
You niggas chasin hoes (hoes)
We call 'em plays, we call it pink 'n rose
Me in the Chevy sit up high, the Lambo sittin low
I'm doin a hunned burnin heads damn near lost control
I'm ridin swervin, I'm ridin servin
My paper confident, I guess these niggas money nervous
That's on errrythang, he a real nigga (I am)
Bitch I'm talkin bout myself cuz I don't feel niggas (Gotti)
I feel realer, that's on errythang
I'm hittin the club tonight and bitch I'm rockin errythang

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I see the money come, seen the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sho'
Set the standards high, sit the chewy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no ho from chasing dough
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
See no paper come 'n go just like the weather change
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
Gotta watch these bitches cause they out here playin head games

<i>[Verse 3 - Ace Hood:]</i>
Went to the dealership, hunned thou in cash
Brand new sale fifty, dropped that on the dash
Better get you one, read that off the tag
That's on errythang, boy got that MacGyver swagg
Stuntin on 'em, Evel Knievel
Swagg so illegal houses as big as cathedrals
That's some other shit, probably with my other bitch
Hoppin out that mothership, my pistol got that rubber grip
Real nigga, circle of G's
Better watch these niggas cuz they snitchin just to get a plea
That's real talk (real talk)
Money my order, that's on errrythang
Don't say AH "I told ya"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I see the money come, seen the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sho'
Set the standards high, sit the chewy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no ho from chasing dough
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
See no paper come 'n go just like the weather change
That's on errythang, that's on errythang
Gotta watch these bitches cause they out here playin head games
