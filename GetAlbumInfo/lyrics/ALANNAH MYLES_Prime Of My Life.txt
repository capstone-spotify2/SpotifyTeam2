<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm in the prime of my life, I feel like a kid
One of these days it'll all catch up
But I'd rather fight than quit
In the , Prime of my life, something's gotta give
Even if it kills, I won't give up
Kill the kill joy... Live!

There's a big hole in my heart, where all the money used to be
If love's a crime, I've done my time as far as I can see
I'd trade in all the bullshit, even if I lose...
For all the rock and roll I've lived I've drunk a case of blues

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm in the prime of my life, feel like a kid
One of these days it'll all catch up
But I'd rather fight than quit
In the prime of my life, something's gotta give
Even if it kills, I won't give up
Kill the kill joy... Live!
(dehn'l alannah'l ana deh deh deh deh)

Life gives us a choice, we can laugh or we can cry
I've been bending over backwards trying to walk a straight damn line
I was borne a child of light, but the devil's been my friend
Ain't nothin' gonna stop this woman from busting this dead end!

<i>[Chorus]</i>

What the hell's so wrong with coming undone
It's too late to stop what's already begun
So what the hell's so wrong with coming undone, Undone!

(dehn'l alannah'l ana deh deh deh deh)

I'm in the prime of my life, feel like a kid
One of these days It'll all catch up, But I'd rather fight than quit
I'm in the prime of my life, something's gotta give
One of these days it'll all catch up but I only got one life to live
I'm in the prime of my life, prime of my life, Prime of my life,
Feel like a kid, one of these days it'll all catch up but I'd rather fight than quit
Prime of my life, something's gotta give, even if it kills, I won't give up,
Kill the kill joy, kill the kill joy,
Live <i>[x9]</i>
