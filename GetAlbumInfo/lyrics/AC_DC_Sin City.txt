Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangrila
I got a burnin' feeling
Deep inside of me
It's a yearnin'
But I'm gonna set it free
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Let me roll ya baby

Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man poor man
Beggar man thief
You ain't got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're getting ready
Look out I'm coming in
So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll them loaded dice
Bring on the dancin' girls and put the Champagne on ice
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm goin' in
To sin city
