Must I intervene make a way by any means
Share the struggles with my brothers can't come in between
I'm living proof and the results of when you chase a dream
Getting cream I was off the porch at sixteen
Hard-Headed but hustle is mindset-ed
Dealers all around me and killers with nine's ready
Mama worry bout me every night, troubled by them siren lights
Praying she don't get the call somebody took her baby's life
Shit's fucked up, black man tough luck
We ain't gotta do shit for the white man to cuff us
Four words: "You live and you learn." I'm hoping for change, niggas hope for a bird
Never sell you my soul to get the shit that I earned
I sit quiet in court, untill that bitch is adjourned
That's true story, livin' in a world full of faith
Brother called the other day and told me "Please be safe"
Niggas murder every day and make the First 48
Find out it's your homeboy, set him up for the cake
Two words: "Fuck That" trust nobody
Every time I think to move I keep the.45 by me
Yeah I do believe in God but homie please don't try me
Two kids that I'm living for I'll catch me a body
Quarter mil' for the whip, yeah you don't know nothin' bout it
Trying to lessen my trouble still double the profit
It's Ace Hood, Yeah you know what the name
Blood shed for the chains, many tears in the game
Sweat given for fame, look at the ways I pave
All the shit I done done all the hope I done gave
Broward County nigga, yeah the city on me
I ain't sign nobody yet but know my city goin' eat
Mama house was on the 9th but Tony store up the street
Sick and tired of niggas talking I'm the one you should see
I'm the nigga to be, fly as whips in the streets
Call it exercise and watch ya boy flex on the beat
I'm too cold, you sweet, <i>[?]</i> yeah you know
Every beat I got a new flow, Ferrari two door
I'm the illest alive, what up Nicki Minaj
