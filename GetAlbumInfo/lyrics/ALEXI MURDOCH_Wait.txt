Feel I'm on the verge of some greath truth
Where I'm finally in my place 
But I'm fumbling still for proof 
And it's cluttering my space 
Casting shadows on my face 
I know I have the strength to move a hill 
But I can hardly leave my room 
So I'll sit here perfectly still 
And I'll listen for a tune 
When the mind is on the moon 

And if I stumble 
And if I stall 
And if I slip now 
And if I should fall 
And if I cant be all that I could be 
Will you, will you wait for me 

Cause everywhere I seem to be 
I am only passing through 
I dream these days about the sea 
Always wake up feeling blue 
Wishing I could dream of you 

So if I stumble 
And if I fall 
And if I slip now 
And loose it all 
And if I can't be all that I could be 
Will you, will you wait for me 

And wait for me 
And wait for me 
And wait for me 
Won't you wait for me 
And wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Won't you wait for me 
And wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Won't you wait for me 
And wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Won't you wait for me 
And wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Won't you wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Please wait for me 
Won't you wait for me
