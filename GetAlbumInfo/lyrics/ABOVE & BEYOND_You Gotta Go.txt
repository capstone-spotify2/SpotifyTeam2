Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins

Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all your signs

You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
And you know you got to go

Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins

Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all your signs

You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
And you know you got to go

You got to go, you got to go

You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
And you know you got to go

You got to go, you got to go
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all of your own signs
You got to go
