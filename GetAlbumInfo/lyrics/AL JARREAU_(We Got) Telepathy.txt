There's a message 
Coming through to me
In my mind's eye I can see
Telepathy
Feel it, I know you're there
Somewhere, everywhere
Like static in the atmosphere
It's all around
Before the moment 
That I saw you
I knew I'd lose control
Don't have to tell me 
That you want to

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Show me the passion
Give me the fire
Can't you see, oh yeah
You got my attention
I got the desire
We got telepathy
Oh

No point trying to hide it
It's invisible...can't fight it
Like static in the atmosphere
I'm lost and found
Before the moment 
That I saw you
I knew I'd lose control
Don't have to tell me 
That you want to

<i>[Chorus]</i>

The closer you get 
The stronger I feel it

Before the moment 
That I saw you
I knew I'd lose control
Don't have to tell me 
That you want to

<i>[Chorus]</i>

We got telepathy
We got telepathy
We got telepathy
The closer you get
The stronger I feel it
