You ought to know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show 
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away 
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape 

So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down? 
Down, down
Baby, are you down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away 
I turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape

So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down? 
Down, down
Baby, are you down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only 
No need to worry
Baby, are you down
Down, down 
Baby, are you down 
Down, down 
Even if the sky is falling down
