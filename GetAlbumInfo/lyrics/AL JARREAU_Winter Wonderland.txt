Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? We'll say, no man
But you can do the job while you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll be walking in a winter wonderland

(In a winter)
Walking in a winter wonderland, wonderland
Walking
(In a winter)
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other children knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though your nose be, be so chilling
Frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland, wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll be walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland, wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll be walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll be walking
