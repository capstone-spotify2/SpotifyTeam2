<i>[Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid (and Ab-Soul)]</i>
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Me) Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling me

<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Alright, I know what you like, I know what you want
I know what you need, I know how to put you out your misery
A-B (dash) S-o-u-l
Infinity when it comes to the possibilities
Anytime you're in my vicinity
And I'll beat it, yeah I'll beat it up, yeah I'll beat it up
Just like it's my enemy, all night
I can't resist, I need it like my pancreas
If you dismiss and no give me kiss kiss, it'll be hard digesting it
Gimme some of that, gimme some of that
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Back it up til a nigga say that's enough
Mirror on the ceiling, everything looking up
Sweetie, I'm trying to get it in like a suite key
Your skin like sweet tea, I need thee
Look sweet thing, you remind me of my jeep, your body's calling
She got work but I think she finna call in, cause I'm all in that thang
And she probably think I'm in love the way I'm falling in that thang
Soulo

<i>[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]</i>
This strange thing got me leaning
This reefer keep on steaming
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
And girl you got me fiending
I don't care about your religion
Cause I just can't resist you
God damn lust demons

<i>[Verse 2: Jay Rock]</i>
Rock, Rock
Leaning like a motherfucker, I be pouring
(Black Hippy Shit) higher than a motherfucker, I be blowing
I'm off that Amber Kush with a bad little bitch call it Amber Rose
She be loving the crew and I be loving her too
She got a thang for them rap niggas I suppose
She feeling my energy
I feel on her thighs, she fill up the Henessey
Now we on the sofa, in a minute I'm a be bending her over
She know my motives, tryna get behind me like a locomotive
She trained, she on the right track
Yeah she got that boomerang then I'm coming right back
She ratchet nasty
She got a ring on her tongue and a ring on her clit
Got my hands on my YKK, sip it down, now she all on my tip
She told me, look at me when I work my magic daddy
She pulled a rabbit out a hat
Made my dick disappear, in thin air
Then she brought it right back
