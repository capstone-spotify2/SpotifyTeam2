The ordeal has begun
To oblige the unknown, within me

As I drown
Cannot remember, cannot think
As I sink, deep... 

Near the monolith of doubt 
Creeps the fear
The fear to lose yourself
In the severe reflection

I don't know
A flashing moment that has frozen me
My whole existence passed by
Through the trusted eyes of a mirror
But it wasn't me I could see

This monolith of everything that I have been
Is vacillated and aghast
The inexorable time has taught me once again
That my features will change and macerate me

See, it's me, my monolith of doubt
