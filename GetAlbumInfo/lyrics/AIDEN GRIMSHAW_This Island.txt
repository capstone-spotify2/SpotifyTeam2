Isolated mind, a teardrop fallen softly calling someone wait for me
Imitated lines, youâre staring at the rainbow but your eyes are colorblind

This island is suicidal ideas supply the fears inside us
I open up my thoughts at night only walls will hold me in

Iâll give you everything
Iâll give you everything

Let it hurt again let it hurt again
Behind my eyes I'm terrified now youâre gone, now youâre gone
Let it hurt again let it hurt again
Behind my eyes I'm terrified now youâre gone, now youâre gone

Fascinating shine, a frozen star thatâs chosen just to lighten up the sky
Animated highs, youâre searching for the answers but the question is why

This island is suicidal ideas supply the fears inside us 
I open up my thoughts at night only walls will hold me in 

Let it hurt again let it hurt again
Behind my eyes I'm terrified now youâre gone, now youâre gone
Let it hurt again let it hurt again
Behind my eyes I'm terrified now youâre gone, now youâre gone

You used to love me 
Do you still love me? 
You used to hold me 
Do you still hold me? 
Now youâre gone, now youâre gone, now youâre gone

You used to love me 
Do you still love me? 
You used to hold me 
Do you still hold me? 
Now youâre gone, now youâre gone, now youâre gone

Let it hurt again let it hurt again 
Behind my eyes I'm terrified now youâre gone, now youâre gone
