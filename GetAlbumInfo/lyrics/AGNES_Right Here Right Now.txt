Take my hand and walk with me 
Let me show you what I'm feeling 
What's going on inside of me 

Don't you know you have changed me? 
Don't you know my wishes all came true? 
You're my angel, now I want to do it all for you 

Right here, right now 
Nothing is impossible 
Right here, right now 
I'm running on a miracle 
I've seen you're face, I feel your love 
And there's nothing I can do 
Right here, right now 
My heart, my heart belongs to you 

Feels like yesterday to me, yeah 
When you pass outside my window 
How you're vision caught my eye, yeah 

Like in only forever 
Something made you turn and look at me 
In a heartbeat, I knew my destiny 

Right here, right now 
Nothing is impossible 
Right here, right now 
I'm running on a miracle 
I've seen you're face, I feel your love
And there's nothing I can do 
Right here, right now 
My heart, my heart belongs to you 

For now and for always 
You'll be the one I love
You'll be the one I turn to

Ohhh 
Right here
(Right here, right now)
(Nothing is impossible)
Right here, right now 
I'm running on a miracle 
I've seen you're face and I feel your love 
And there's nothing I can do 
(Right here)
Right now 
My heart belongs to you 

My heart belongs 
My heart belongs 
My heart belongs to you, ohhh 

I've seen you're face and I feel your love 
And there's nothing I can do 
Right here, right now 
My heart, my heart belongs to you 
My heart belongs to you
