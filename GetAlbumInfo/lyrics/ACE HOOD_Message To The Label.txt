You knew better you'd do better
All these motherfuckers stealing my flow
On they songs lord knows imma trend setter
I'm a neighborhood dope dealer
Mo' whips than the car dealer
You ain't nothing but a seat filler
Bars after bars I'm a well known beat killer
20 grams for the chinchilla
Diamonds cooler than the windchiller
My nigga P got the plug on the villas
He just call up and talk up <i>[?]</i>
100K for the weekend, nigga living like a kingpin
I'm a shark to you rap niggas
Cos y'all scared of the deep end
So fuck them niggas not no apologetic
I'm copacetic my genetics is the real nigga
You too pathetic where the medic I'm an ill nigga
Ahead of time, paralyzed don't feel niggas
God flow this the god flow
Million dollar convos in the condo
Say my name turn a lame into John Doe
When them shots rain better have your poncho
Big dog talking big shit
I wish a nigga would on my wishlist
They don't wanna see me pissed
If I ever hear a diss that's a walk in the park
That's a picnic
A nigga sick of being patient
Ain't doing them another favor
You looking at the beast of the south
And the words out my mouth this a message to the label

Greatness, nigga this greatness
Whole lot of hustling, whole lot of grinding
Whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness
So shut the fuck up and let make it
A whole lot of hustling, a whole lot of grinding
A whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness
A whole lot of grinding, a whole lot of hustling
A whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness

Tell Stunna have the yacht ready
Tell Diddy I'm ciroc ready
Pockets fatter than a pot belly
Young nigga with the gameplan
Been the realest since I came in
They don't want no problems with the boy
I remain at a poise like Floyd at the weigh-in
I got a model with the ring side
I'ma fuck her on the king side
And every nigga that was hating back then
Back when know they still selling bean pies
I'm the nigga that they wanna be
I got the motherfucking recipe
I be chilling with the zoes
I be cooking up the flows
Then I gave it to the industry
I'm the illest no debating
Hottest in the making I should tell that shit to Satan
Pull up in the latest like a real nigga made it
Bought a crib and then skated
Who the fuck is underrated ha
I want a mil for my new deal
Whole box full of benadryl
Cos these lame niggas sick on me
And when I die have this playing at my ceremony

Greatness, nigga this greatness
A whole lot of hustling, a whole lot of grinding
A whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness
So shut the fuck up and lets make it
A whole lot of hustling, a whole lot of grinding
A whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness
A whole lot of grinding, a whole lot of hustling
A whole lot of patience
Greatness, nigga this greatness
