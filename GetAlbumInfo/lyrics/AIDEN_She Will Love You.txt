You say you're in love
Well cursive wrote this sonnet to the end
You say you're in love
But this heart still can't pretend
Everything dressed in picturesque
So perfectly aligned
Will you come to me?
Will you come to me?

Kiss me quick I'm losing
Well can we live forever?

You say you're in love
Well beauty slides this silhouette to screen
Will you come to me?
Will you come to me?

Kiss me quick I'm losing
Well can we live forever?
Kiss me quick I'm losing
But I'm miserable still

She will love you through all the lies
She will love you through your disguise
She will love you through your demise
And sing our lives forever, 
Sing our lives together, won't you?

Can you take me back so far away?
Can you take me back so far away?
There's something left...
There's something left to say
There's something left...
You got something left to say

She will love you through all the lies
She will love you through your disguise
She will love you through your demise
And sing our lives forever, 
Sing our lives together, won't you?

She will love you through all the lies
She will love you through your disguise
She will love you through your demise, yeah yeah
And sing our lives forever, 
Sing our lives together, won't you?
