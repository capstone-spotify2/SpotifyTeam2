Wild Horses &amp; honky Tonkin' bars
Drives a man to chase gold buckles and guitars
I don't do it for the money I can't blame the fame
It's been a long hard ride, still I saddle up just the same
I'm rolling right along, sky above is blue
I got the window rolled down and I'm listening to Chris Ledoux
Half a can of caffeine running through my veins
Running rain or shine and I'm never pulling back the reins
No you may not see me on your TV, I'm seldom heard on your radio
But if your looking, you might just find me somewhere between 
The road and the rodeo
