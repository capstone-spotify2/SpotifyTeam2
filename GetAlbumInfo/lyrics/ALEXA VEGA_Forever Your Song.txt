I feel my head spinning 'round
But I ain't looking for no one to save me, no
I keep my feet on the ground
By hanging onto the love that you gave me
Here in my heart, where our world's not apart
Where your voice helps me find my way home

Cause I know, oh, oh, oh,
That I won't never really be alone
Oh, oh, oh,
Cause I got your song right here inside of me
(Forever your song)
(Forever your song)

I see your face in my dreams
Telling me that I got to hold my head up high
But nothing's bad as it seems
There's a place where these dreams can never die
In my heart, where our world's not apart
Where your voice helps me find my way home

Cause I know, oh, oh, oh,
That I won't never really be alone
Oh, oh, oh,
Cause I got your song right here inside of me
(Forever your song)
(Forever your song)

One day, I know I'll find a place of my own
Sweet peace of mind and a world 
That feels safe all of the time
No more mistakes, no more goodbyes
But oh, I'll never let go, I'll never let go
I'll always hold onto your song

Cause I know, oh, oh, oh,
That I won't never really be alone
Oh, oh, oh,
Cause I got your song right here inside of me

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, that I won't never really be alone
Oh, oh, oh,
Cause I got your song right here inside of me

Oh, oh, oh
That I won't never really be alone
Oh, oh, oh,
Cause I got your song right here inside of me
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
