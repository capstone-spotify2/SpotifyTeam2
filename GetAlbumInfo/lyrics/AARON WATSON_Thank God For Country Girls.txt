Hold on my buddies
On the block good bye
As we drove away I wiped a tear from my eye
I thought my life had come to an early end

But this is where the story begins
My daddy promised me I'd make new friends
But still I wondered how in a town of only 10
There at the dairy queen my first night
Have mercy, it was love at first sight

Thank god for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls

She was all by herself sittin' at a corner booth
Wearin' a summer dress and a pair of cowgirl boots
I heard her hummin' a Meral Hagard song
I looked down, my heart was gone
I walked up to her, she saw my hesitation
I asked if she had a dinner reservation
She said I'd love to have your company
I said hello love, goodbye mister lonely

Thank God for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls

No, my friends back home were missin' out
So they came to see what the fuss was all about
Before the first night had come and gone
They were all singing my song

They said,
Thank god for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls
Thank god for country girls
