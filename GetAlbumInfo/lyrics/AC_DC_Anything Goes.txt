Got a taste of a rocking band
Standing there holding out your hand
Better lock up all your doors
She's like a spinning dynamo
You're handing out the token prize
Giving you a brand new ride

Ooh there she goes she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes

Banging drums working out 'all fast'
Heavy tune I can play it loud
You know she's blowing away all the others
You're never man enough, take it on all night
You better razzle dazzle on that stage
Keep on rocking on all through the night

Ooh there she goes she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes

A heavy rocking tune is playing
Playing as the night rolls on
Sneaking off with the Romeo
Where she goes nobody knows

A heavy rocking tune is playing
On a flat screen colour tv
Sneaking over, creepy crawly
Never give it up to take it out through the night

There she goes she goes
And nobody knows
There she goes she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
