I can't stop, sleep, and walking in, underneath the moonlight
I can hear you calling reaching for me every night
I'm yours, you're mine
Oh your kiss me brings me back to life
Oh no no no
Don't dash my love
Oh no no no
Don't dash my love
If you're still thinking about me

Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh
Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh

Look out when we're touching underneath the sky light
Electric can't control it
Cause your body feels so right
I'm yours, you're mine
Oh your kiss me brings me back to life
Oh no no no
Don't dash my love
Oh no no no
Don't dash my love
If you're still thinking about me

Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh
Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh

I'm doing limbo
Your body is my temple
I'm doing limbo
Baby where your body tonight
I'm doing limbo
Baby where your body tonight
Oh oh oh
I'm doing limbo
Your body is my temple
I'm doing limbo
Baby where your body tonight
I'm doing limbo
Baby where your body tonight

Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh
Don't you be so hard on me
If you love me, come and give me your everything
Yeah, yeah, oh
