I'm awake
No longer sleeping
I made my mistakes
It's what I was needing

And now I'm breaking away
From the crowd
I wanna just scream out loud
Hey, no one can stand in my way

I believe I'm holding onto a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see I'm holding on?
Holding on, holding onto a dream

I've made up my mind
This fire is burning
I'll follow the signs
These pages are now turning

Now I'm dancing alone
In the moonlight
Closing my eyes, it just feels right
Letting my heart lead the way

I believe I'm holding onto a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see I'm holding on?
Holding on, holding onto a dream

You know I can't do this alone
A house never could make a home
Yeah, yeah

And now I'm breaking away
From the crowd
I wanna just scream out loud
Hey, no one can stand in my way

I believe I'm holding onto a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see I'm holding on?
Holding on, holding onto a dream

Holding onto a dream
Holding onto a dream
Holding onto a dream
