Here, here in this heart it's cold as stone
Must welcome these memories, as shallow as my eyes have slowly become

Hearts, frail heart left broken
Cold and known for its bitter agony
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become
Sting, crush and bite in my soul, my heart bleeds

Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Empty memories won't heal the pain

We know only sorrow
There's no future in tomorrow
All our hopes were buried too young for the years that should have followed

We know only hatred
There's no future in our anguish
For all hope is buried with life and reprisal will be ours

It's empty
We're empty
They're empty memories

Here, here in this heart
It's Cold as stone, for no feeling's there to warm, it is as empty as our dreams and hopes
Now our future is gone
It stings and bites in my soul, my heart bleeds

Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Time was changed forever that night
Leaving me - no, no, no - alone with empty memories
Empty memories
Empty memories
