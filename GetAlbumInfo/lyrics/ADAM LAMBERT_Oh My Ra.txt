Oh My Ra <i>[8x]</i>

Hieroglyphic <i>[4x]</i>

Hieroglyphic, Hieroglyphic
It's eternal and it's so magnetic
Hypnotize me, Hypnotize me
Bat your eyes and take me on a journey

Out for a walk
In the clouds
You do things
Most don't say aloud
Out for a walk
In the clouds
You do things
Most don't say aloud

It's no surprise
On the mile, we'll float on forever
It's no surprise
No denial, we'll live on forever
It's no suprise
Oh, oh, oh, oh woah

Oh my ra, it's made of gold
How much love can one hold?
Oh my ra <i>[2x]</i>

Oh my ra <i>[2x]</i>

Hi, take me on a journey

Out for a walk
In the clouds
You do things
Most don't say aloud

It's no surprise
On the mile, we'll float on forever
It's no surprise
No denial, we'll live on forever
It's no surprise
Oh, oh, oh, oh woah

Oh my ra, it's made of gold
How much love can one hold?
