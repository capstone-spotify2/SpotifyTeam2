Baby, this is crazy
Can't believe you said Hello
Can't take it, just can't fake it
I'm about to lose control
Boy you should be mine,
Our worlds they should collide
Stop playing games, don't make me wait
My love is qualified!

Whatever you want from me
I'm yours and I'm here to please
You gotta love that thing, don't stop it, stop it
Whatever you want from me
Ask and you will receive
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows!

Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows
Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows

My body's moving for you
Baby, what you've done to me?!
What we've got hotter and hotter,
Electric chemistry
Boy this ain't no joke, I'm ready to explode
Don't play it safe 'cause I can't wait
I really need to know

Whatever you want from me
Ask and you will receive
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows!

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows
Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows

Don't wait, don't think about
And I will make it baby unforgettable
So do it now, don't miss the party
Make your trumpet blow!

Clap it!
And when your trumpet blows
You make me lose control,
You make me lose control!

Oh oh, oh oh
When the trumpet blows
Oh oh, oh oh

Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows
Oh oh, oh oh
You know I'm ready baby when the trumpet blows
