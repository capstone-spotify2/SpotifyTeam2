Tell me the reason why you say
You wanna look around
Tell me what takes you far away
Leavin' me on the ground
All of the things you do and say
Turnin' me upside down
I can't go on and on this way
Stumblin' 'round and 'round

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Do do do, so won't you won't you
Come on and say it
Don't you know you gotta love me
You gotta want me

Tell me what I should say or do
How do I catch your eye
I made a goddess out of you
Ready to do or die
Gathered a thousand stars for you
Took 'em right out of the sky
Tell me you dream about me too
Tell me a tender lie

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

<i>[BRIDGE:]</i>
Well there's a sparrow without a wing
And there's a song with no one to sing
And there's a fool on the hill who thinks
he's doin' fine
You roam the world in your lonely flight
Singin' songs in the dead of night
And everything seems to be all right
But not inside
Woo ooh ooh ooh

So tell me that you won't hesitate
Betcha we make a rhyme
We've got take the hand of fate
While we are in our prime
Come on and help me syncopate
Let your heart beat like mine
This is an easy step to take
Easy to dance in time

<i>[CHORUS / BRIDGE]</i>

Tell me the reason why you say
You wanna look around
Tell me what takes you far away
Leavin' me on the ground
Tell me what I should do or say
How do I catch your eye
Tell me that you won't hesitate
Betcha we make a rhyme

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
