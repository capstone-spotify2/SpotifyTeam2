Presenting Lily Mars
Tap dancer, a soon-to-be star
She'll beat your heart so fast
Spotlight's on Lily tonight

She's on Channel One's late night show
She's watching people come and go
Producer says, "You've got it made, girl"
And when she's lying sleepless in his arms
The frost paints roses on poor Lily's window pane

Presenting Lily's mum
She still lives on in Lily's mind
Stopped ageing years ago
Now she's gone but left her dreams in Lily's eyes
Lily's wondering if mummy's watching her tonight

"Good morning," says father Mars
Presenting a salesman's cheerful face
His mouth is never shut
As he strides from door to door to door to door
Watch his face as he puts his foot in my door

Presenting Lily Mars
She's sensing moons and stars
The pills that Doc subscribed
Will keep the sleepless, dreamless nights away
Oh, poor Lily, now you're sleeping day by day
By day by day by day by day
Bye, bye

Poor Lily, mummy's watching you tonight
