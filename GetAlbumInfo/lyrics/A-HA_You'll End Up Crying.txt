You'll end up crying
With your mother's eyes
Pretend you can't see yourself
Could have been better
Could have been worse
You could have been yourself

Brought up in mom's arms
Nowhere to fall
Now you're out climbing
Taking it all

You'll end up crying
With your mother's eyes
Suffer that moment's pain
Could have done better
Could have done worse
Lost in your love for more

Now you're out climbing
And you should know
You'll end up crying
Wherever you may go

Brought up in mom's arms
Nowhere to fall
Now you're out climbing
Climbing to fall

You'll end up crying
With your mother's eyes
Something is lost from the start
Could have been better
Could have been worse
You're going to need me there
