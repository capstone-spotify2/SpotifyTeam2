We both work hard for money already spent
Blaming each other for where it all went
Never thinking of love only paying the loans
Griping bout' bills and keeping up with the Jones
Just once let's forget about making ends meet
Or whose got the nicest yard on the street
Darlin' let loose, let your hair down
We're staying at home for a night on the town

So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance

When you're in my arms it makes me feel
Like I own a mansion on top of the hil
But it's not how big's the house it's how happy's the home
How poor is a rich man who lives all alone 

So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance

So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
