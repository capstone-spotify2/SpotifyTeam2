I'm all alone
you're far away
Never learned from my mistakes
I should have known
Just what to say
To make you want to stay
You were always the one giving
I was always there to take it
Take your heart and break it
Ohhhh

And I'll never make it without you
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
I'm making my last stand
It took a moment to say
It wasn't you it was me
I couldn't let you in
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again

Miss you the most when I sleep
Turning nightmares into dreams
Can't lose hope
It's killing me
(killing me)
I'm the one who made you leave
But if I just take a chance now
Open up and finally reach out
(reach out)
Can I save it all somehow
Ohhhhh

And I'll never make it without you
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
I'm making my last stand
It took a moment to say
It wasn't you it was me
I couldn't let you in
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again

I'm all alone
You're far away
I finally found the words to say
Ohhhh
And I'll never make it without you
(sorry for the way I shut you out)
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
(sorry for the way)
I'll make it my last stand
It took a moment to say it wasn't you
It was me
I couldn't let you in
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me
(I couldn't let you in)
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again
Won't be afraid won't push you away
