Been meaning to write you sincerely
So let me lay this down
Ain't much to say, ain't much to say, unless itâs a vow
So whatâs this about?

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Give me nothing man, Iâll take it on my own
Got a whole lot to go, only slow when I've grown old
Well one piece of advice, for you limelight seeking shh
Twitter plus the couch equals you never gonna blow
You can talk a big game, you can want to walk to fame
The sidewalk ends fall off if the grind ain't the same as the FAM
Nothing to gain if you canât get yourself outta the place that you claim canât help, well
The ladder for me man keeps getting longer
The climb gets harder, my arms getting stronger
You blind old man cause youâre starting to wander
Snake of the game bringing nothing but problems
You on the come up like your leader's got his eyes closed
Iâd arrive before you if I decide to drive slow
But Iâm not Iâm posted up never lie low
Youâll vanish real quick like your missing dog Fido

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Itâs a curse and a blessing to get this way in the first place
And your shit was supposed to drop around my 15th birthday
Gotta be real and cleaned up behind curtains
Is this really your grand scheme to prove that youâre worth it?
Well I've seen it before but good job
They click next stray away quick move along
Shake they head say They never going back to this blog
Canât use your brights homie cause your heads filled with fog
If you want something grab it, if you have a beat stab it
Shitload of legwork not just living lash, Iâm up at 3 AM and Iâm still mentally active
Mind is traveling to a height thatâll send your ass packing
In the third row seat of the van realizing opportunities within patience
Instant gratification is not in the plans for your brand
Buzzer beater precision they coming running from the stands
