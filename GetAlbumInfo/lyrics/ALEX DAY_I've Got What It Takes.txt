There are so many souls who don't follow their dreams
Ignoring their passions makes no sense to me
I could lie or waste time to follow the seasons
But I think I'd regret it when I fall asleep

I don't have superpowers
There's no magic spell
But I remain faithful for things to go well
I'm not looking for miracles
At least for today
I know I've got what it takes

And it's hard when you start and its never at ease
The stars are so far but they'll always be seen
I can't pretend I just make things for no rhyme or reason
But boy the works worth it when I fall asleep

I don't have superpowers,
There's no magic spell
But I remain faithful for things to go well
I'm not looking for miracles
At least for today
I know I've got what it takes

There's no end in sight
So I'll take my time
Crossing the line
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep singing this song

And if people don't like it, well it won't bother me
Failure's still something I can say I've achieved
And I won't forget their opinion
Moving on isn't easy
But not doing things would be boring indeed

I don't have superpowers
There's no magic spell
But I remain faithful for things to go well
I'm not looking for miracles
At least for today
I know I've got what it takes
I know I've got what it takes
