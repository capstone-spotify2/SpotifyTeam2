Who am I at night when my eyes are closed tight?
Who am I and where when I see far beyond?
Every border, every dream, every hidden memory
Every nightmare, truth or dare
Who do I see

Now
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?

Where am I?
Tell me, what should go, what should stay?
Where am I, where am I?
And where shall I go tonight?
Every night a different theme,
Every time you're in a different dream
Am I me there, what am I?
Who will I be

Now
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we being everyone?

I cry, I fall
I love, I hate
I know many, though no face ever stays
I breathe, I fly
I kill, I die
Though there's nothing that I know
No-one can recall where I have been or who I was

Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we being everyone?

Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
It's me being everyone
