Youâre asking me to tell you
How to deal with that old flame
When you see her out there
And you still feel the same
How she ripped out your whole heart
And took it with her when she left
Youâre face to face now looking at her
Sheâs holding on to somebody else

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Tell her you donât love her
And tell her you donât care
And tell her you donât need her
And you donât miss her then
And give her that cold shoulder
And say youâve never cried
Just look her in the eye and lie

You may not get over
Some loves in your life
But as youâll get over
Youâll know wrong more than right
But you might get lucky
And those feelings fade away
The chances are theyâll come back around
To be ready now and just what to say

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Just tell her you donât love her
And tell her you donât care
And tell her you donât need her
And you donât miss her then
And give her that cold shoulder
And say youâve never cried
Just look her in the eye and lie <i>[X2]</i>
