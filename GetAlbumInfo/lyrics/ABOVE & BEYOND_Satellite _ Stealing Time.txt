My love is like footsteps in this snow, baby
I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The palest light has come to wake you
But you will never realize
That I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby

I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I'll light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love may be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby

You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star
Your singing satellite
Your singing satellite, your satellite
Your singing satellite
You're half a world away

I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red-eye
And winding down the window

My future is a Valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die

You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star
Your singing satellite
