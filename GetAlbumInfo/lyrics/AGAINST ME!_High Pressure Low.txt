There was a high pressure low developing off the coast of Africa
Uplift in the atmosphere pushed waves
Across the ocean towards Antilles and Bon Air
I paced in Agitation. I drew the curtains closed
I set the air conditioner low
I pressed a warm wash cloth to my face
Somewhere out there a hurricane was coming

There's just no future left for us to dream of
Living in an era of instability
So caught up in the culture of their rivals
Fear breeds in honest men
It's a high pressure low

7 missiles flying over the sea of Japan
Tales of feral children sleeping in wolf dens
And the pious preacher commands
I hold my breath in anticipation
Into the shelter of the jungle noble savages run
Vestal virgins triumph over life long inhibitions
And I wonder, what is real? What is fiction?

There's just no future left for us to dream of
Living in an era of instability
So caught up in the culture of their rivals
Fear breeds in honest men
It's a high pressure low

Would anyone forgive Robert McNamara?
In retrospect he had to admit
There was mistake in going to war without first asking all the questions
Yes, Robert Strange McNamara
There are those who just cannot forget
And I wonder, have I lost my own compassion?

There's just no future left for us to dream of
Living in an era of instability
So caught up in the culture of their rivals
Fear breeds in honest men
It's a high pressure low
