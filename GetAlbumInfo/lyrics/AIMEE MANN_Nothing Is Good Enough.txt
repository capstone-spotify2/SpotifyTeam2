Once upon a time
Is how it always goes
But I'll make it brief
What was started out
With such excitement
Now I gladly end with relief
In what now has become a familiar motif

That nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all

Critics at their worst
Could never criticize 
The way that you do
No, there's no one else I find
To undermine or dash a hope
Quite like you
And you do it so casually, too

'Cause nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all

Ladies and gentlemen,
Here's exhibit A
Didn't I try again
And did the effort pay?
Wouldn't a smarter man
Simply walk away? 

It doesn't really help
That you can never say
What you're looking for
But you'll know it when you hear it
Know it when you see it
Walk through the door
So you say, so you've said
Many times before

But nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all

Nothing is good enough...
