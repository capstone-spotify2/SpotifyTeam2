You've got your pretty face
You've got disarming eyes
You've got such social grace
I've got my pretty spies

I found you lost, misplaced
I loved that lovely guise
I said I'd try my luck
And you said

Well you don't
You don't have to try

I forgot that night
What you said that night
I had the most exquisite time

Well you got that right
But it's not the whole story
I want it all
I court the loveliest of crimes

Say it, as if it were true
We've got the knife
You left behind
Play it just like you do

I wanna hear you mean it
When you say I'm not next in line
I court the loveliest of crimes
Save it, cause we've got the knife

You've got your pretty face
You've got your stunning glow
You've got exquisite taste
I've got the marks to show

You said you'd shoot the stars
But bullets make you blush
Turns out
You liked to play

Play with knives
And I hear that it
Gives you a rush

Well we've got the knife
Yeah, we've got the knife
I've got the knife
You left behind

Well we've got the knife
Now I want the whole story
I want it all
I court the loveliest of crimes

Say it, as if it were true
We've got the knife
You left behind
Play it just like you do

I wanna hear you mean it
When you say I'm not next in line
I court the loveliest of crimes
Save it, cause we've got the knife

I thought that you
Looked familiar
I'd seen your face
Long before that night

Now I wait
For you were no stranger
No stranger to
To taking a life

I court the loveliest of crimes

Say it, as if it were true
We've got the knife
You left behind
Play it just like you do

I wanna hear you mean it
When you say I'm not next in line
I court the loveliest of crimes
Save it, cause we've got the knife

We've got the knife
