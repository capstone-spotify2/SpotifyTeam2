<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Hands in the air, if you been broke
I see millionaires, making bread that's the end goal
Private jet Benzo, can't see through the window
So if I die I pray to God he brings me back as Sim Dope

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Sim Dope, 911 rims spokes
Back when it was college I wouldâve came out with crib notes
Teachers say he got a problem dealing with the temple
But you ain't even fucking with his gym clothes

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Don't see the roof, that's German auto
J.C. Le Roux, 1000 bottles
I see the truth, this the land of promise
Call me the proof, I'm just being honest

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Sometimes I look at my mother I think of what couldâve been
Imagine building a palace thatâs only fit for a queen
My daddy climbed up the ladder until he ran out of steam
Reputation was damaged but never ran out of dreams
Thatâs why I talk in my sleep
Fortunately my esteem is awkward for people who awfully talkative in the street
Especially if all the talking is cheap
I got the recipe making peace with my enemies my conscious is clean

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Iâm in this bitch with Mandela
They pull my name out the envelope you should fuck with the winners
You got some buzz from your single but thatâs just luck for beginners
Iâm coming back in another life just to stunt on your children
Drop top for the summer time
Proposing this toast focused on goals like Iâm number 9
Every one of these flows my foes gon' analyse
Eyes closed while I fantasize
Nice clothes and my jewellery ice cold like Savannah Dry
Power moves being strategized
So if I die Iâm leaving behind some real dope
Bring me back as Sim Dope, thereâs still hope

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Hands in the air, if you been broke
I see millionaires, making bread that's the angle
Private jet Benzo, can't see through the window
So if I die I pray to God he brings me back to Sim Dope
