<i>[Originally by Morrissey]</i>

Oh, you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been, so

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you

And I know a place
Where no one is likely to pass
You don't care if it's late
And, you don't care if you're lost

And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you presume too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
Iâm gonna get you

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you
