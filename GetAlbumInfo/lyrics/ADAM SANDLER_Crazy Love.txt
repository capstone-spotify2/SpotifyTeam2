<i>[Adam:]</i> You don't mind that I think everybody's a robot and all my conversations are being recorded
<i>[Lisa:]</i> And you don't mind that all of my pants are way too short on me 
and I also stabbed someone with a pair of scissors a long time ago (ha-ha-ha)
<i>[Adam:]</i> And you don't care that I collect dead animals from the side 
of the road then pretend they're alive and think I'm a famous football player
<i>[Lisa:]</i> And you don't have a problem with me 
when I follow people I've never met before and force them to look 
at the portrait of Neil Diamond I have tattooed on my back
<i>[Adam:]</i> It's very pretty, baby
<i>[Both:]</i>
Well you must have been sent from above
You're all that I can think of
You're just as psychotic as me
My crazy love
<i>[Adam:]</i> Well it never bothers you when I wear my snowsuit 
to bed every night and I make you speak in tongues to me until I fall asleep
<i>[Lisa:]</i> Blah bloo blah bloo bloo
<i>[Adam:]</i> Thank you
<i>[Lisa:]</i> And you don't make fun of me 'cause I still make out 
with my stepfather and I also tell everyone I was on a UFO 
for two and a half years
<i>[Adam:]</i> I believe you sugarpie
<i>[Both:]</i>
'Cause our love is right on track
I'm yours, your mine it's a fact
Don't forget to take your Prozac
My crazy love
<i>[Adam:]</i> Well yesterday I tickled a man who wasn't even there
<i>[Lisa:]</i> Oh three days before that I ran down the street in my 
Wonder Woman underwear
<i>[Adam:]</i> I didn't care Babe I know I never had a job 'cause I'm afraid 
to talk to people 'cause I know that they're all robots who are seeking information
<i>[Lisa:]</i> They can't fool you sweetheart 
And I know that you know that I'm the one who burned my cousin 
Chester's house to the ground but you told the cops we were out 
ballroom dancing when the came and questioned you
<i>[Adam:]</i> I ain't no fink, dollface
<i>[Both:]</i>
'Cause we know that it's true
Only I could love you
We both eat with our hands
My crazy love
<i>[Lisa:]</i> My crazy, crazy love
<i>[spoken to end]</i>
<i>[Adam:]</i> Oh I wish everybody was dead except for you, baby
<i>[Lisa:]</i> I feel the same way Would you throw some macaroni on me?
<i>[Adam:]</i> Oh yeah, here you go
<i>[splurt]</i>
