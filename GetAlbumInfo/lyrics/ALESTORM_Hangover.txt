I got a hangover
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until they close up
And I can drink until I throw up
And I don't ever ever want to grow up
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going
I got a little bit trashed last night
I got a little bit wasted
I got a little bit mashed last night
I got a little shit faced-ed
I'm on a ship
If you don't know
Well now you know
I got a hangover
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until they close up
And I can drink until I throw up
And I don't ever ever want to grow up
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on
Drink up, cause a party ain't a party
'Til you ride all through it
End up on the floor wit can't remember you clueless
Officer like what the hell is you doing
Stumbling, tumbling, you wa'know what? come again
Give me rum, give me gin, give me liquor, give me champagne
Bubbles 'til the end
What happens after that?
If you inspired then tell a friend
Like oh my homie Gregar,
we can all sip again
and again, and again
remember this
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant
We're kicked to the head,
who's selling it
I got a hangover,
that's my medicine
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent
A little Rum can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up,
so let the drinks go up, go up
I got a hangover
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until they close up
And I can drink until I throw up
And I don't ever ever want to grow up
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on
