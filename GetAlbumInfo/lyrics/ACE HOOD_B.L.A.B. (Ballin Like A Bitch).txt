Ace Hood
Bitch Iâm ballinâ, bitch Iâm ballinâ

Aye, ever since I can remember I've been ballin like a biiitch,
Private plane champagne bitches gettin sweeet
Ever since that money came
They've been on the diick,
Some fine supermodels always end up on my lease

What is in for? Fuck what that pussy cost,
I'll blow bout 20 Benjamins just to piss em off
Bitch I am here to set it off, I'm here to set if off
You used to be the man homie, now you falling off
You niggas bought a ball, I bought a club hour
My condo. on the beach, call it my club house,
L.M.A.O. what the fuck they hatin for?
Stayin some sneakers that won't drop until the money sold
Everytime I ride I keep my 9 I'm talkin romo
Niggas runnin they mouth I get to snappin like a photo
You fallin low with all these bitches that's a no no
You pillow talking with these hoes youse a homo
Stick to the cheat code, I remain in beast mode
See me throwing money like Iâm working on my free throw
If I'm spending money she officially my freak
And I keep them thangs they go wherever that we go

Aye, ever since I can remember I've been ballin like a biiitch,
Private plane champagne bitches gettin sweeet
Ever since that money came
They've been on the diick,
Some fine supermodels always end up on my lease

Okay now hello there America, swagga will embarrass ya
Catch me in Versace it go well with my character
It's in my genetics to be fly on the amateurs
Balling like a biiitch so disgusting how I'm pulling up
Riding in that Phantom Ghost, Yellow bong camel toe
Jury on tropical call it Michael Angelo
All black shawty get to singing Barry Manilow
Fuckin rep my money long that's that nigga in the door
Three cars bigger crib couple mill. I'm 24
Livin fast semiflow competition send me more
Just to piss them haters off I might go buy a fuckin boat
Money stuck on overload cars I imported those
Women got a lot of them I switch them like my Under clothes
I just did a new deal now and I got a new bitch
They stealing my old flows but I'm on some new shiiit

Aye, ever since I can remember I've been ballin like a biiitch,
