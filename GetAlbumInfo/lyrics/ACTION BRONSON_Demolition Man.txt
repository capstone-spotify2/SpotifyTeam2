<i>[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]</i>
Big willy, I'm fuckin' whores
Since a youngin' grabbed the pistol, skipped the chores
Hit the weed and said "It's on"
Got with my older Loc's they threw your boy a zone
Before my mom could smell the scent that shit was gone
Movin' on to bigger things now, don't call my phone
Carry chrome, I think them boys after me
But I shoot fast like athletes
Number one Magic flipper, I'm Anthony
Oops, threw a couple at your coupe
Mr. Hard-top, don't fuckin' lose your roof
Smashin' on a 110
Empty most of the clip, shit only got one sin
Where's Waldo at? Put this bitch to his lens
Got the dimes all wrapped, on his block like you're still friends
Still low from the po-po, no L's in the Volvo
Mask gon' catch a photo when my glove's wrapped around the 4-4

<i>[Verse 2: Action Bronson]</i>
Called it statuatory rape cause the steak wasn't mature
I'm laid out by the lake, you lay with inflatable mates
I lace my shoes tight and ready for the paper chase
I like my girls with African bodies and Asian face
Only green M&amp;M's placed in my dressing room
Pineapple juice, roast turkey
If I want, I got a bitch to suck a thirty dick circle
Then hop up in a cab, this just to serve a bitch purple
Come back, make rice for the fellas
Every single person rockin' leather
Cheddar attatched, my mental is hash from the medicine cabinet
Rock a shirt, got the pattern of the wilderness habitat
I make kids, and it felt ready
Yours are 23 wearin' bibs slurping spaghetti
Your family cancer took her tits off
Don't even look us in the eye
Spit the shit to make a lesbian cry, dyke
