A hand is winding the clock in your head
Tensions rise, push the needle to red
Pick up the tempo, it's getting late
You've got that inner need ...... accelerate

What now lies in between the hunter and the prey
Set sail, apart from the rest, let nothing get in your way

Speed and power, take command
You've got the world in your hand
Pull the trigger, move out ahead
There's two kinds of people....The Quick and the Dead

Cut loose the horses, right to the chase
Got to adrenalize, win this human race
Driving momentum, you take the lead
Gaining intensity, strive to succeed

What now lies in between the hunter and the prey
Set sail, apart from the rest, nothing will get in your way

Speed and power, take command
You've got the world in your hand
Pull the trigger, move out ahead
There's two kinds of people....The Quick and the Dead

What now lies in between the hunter and the prey
Set sail, apart from the rest, nothing will get in your way

Speed and power, take command
You've got the world in your hand
Pull the trigger, move out ahead
There's two kinds of people.... The Quick and the Dead

Speed and power, take command
You've got the world in the palm of your hand
Pull the trigger, move out ahead
There's two kinds of people.... The Quick and the Dead
