Good morning sunshine,
I hope that you're well
Honey I missed you,
Last night when night fell
You should know, sunshine,
You brighten my day
The world gets so dark, love,
When you go away

They say absence makes
The heart grow fonder
But I can't help but wonder

If the darkness came tomorrow,
Could I keep you in my mind?
Where you rise I'll gladly follow
Just for the chance
To stand in your light

Good morning sunshine,
I'm glad you're still here
My darlin', it's hard
When my friends can't be near
Till I can be there
To show them I'm true
I hope what they're seeing
Is as bright as you

They say absence makes
The heart grow fonder
But I can't help but wonder

If the darkness came tomorrow,
Could I keep you in my mind?
Where you rise I'll gladly follow
Just for the chance
To stand in your light

If the darkness came tomorrow,
Could I keep you in my mind?
Where you rise I'll gladly follow
Just for the chance
To stand in your light

Just for the chance
To stand in your light

Good morning sunshine,
I wish for your heart
There's no point pretending
That you won't burn out
But you're still a symbol
To all that you meet
'Cause you keep on shining,
You're extraordinary

If the darkness came tomorrow,
Could I keep you in my mind?
Where you rise I'll gladly follow
Just for the chance
To stand in your light

If the darkness came tomorrow,
Could I keep you in my mind?
Where you rise I'll gladly follow
Just for the chance
To stand in your light

Just for the chance
To stand in your light

Good morning sunshine
