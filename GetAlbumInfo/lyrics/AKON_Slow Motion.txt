<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Slow motion, I left my last girl heart broken
I'm jeep lowing down with the doors open
Policy lonely is start pooring
Yeah my car old school but my bitch is foreign
This is the life of a young boss
On 85 getting head with my top off
BBS TV in my Sprinter
Balling on these niggas I'm a spring in the winter
Ball with the team baby girl we're some winners
Fucking with them lanes which you see them niggas
Got my Stevie Wonder's on I ain't seein' me niggas
Killing these rappers, RPME nigga

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Moving slow in this McLaren so they all can see me
Nigga waiting out of tune, shit is so easy
I'm living life, I'm on top of mine
And there's nobody here on Earth could ever stop my grind
Say slow money, it's better than make it none at all
So I'm taking my time because I'm need it all
Paper chasing, getting money you on another level
But still I'm rocking with them goons and them fucking rebels
Ain't a movie a spril life, I really live it
If you heard me talk about it then I probably did it
Real talk slow down take your time homie
Go hard, go home when it's time homie

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Slow motion, fuck the speed limit slow mo
I like a life skin bitch 5-4
Got my true religions on with the bank roll
Got your girl live long like a feel go
Real dough, I give dough
That 72 Chevelle made me feel hoe
Behold, say I've conceeded
In my ever bullshit and no need me
Kill me on the east with a lot of two little spices and some jolly rinces
All black cars like the fucking black pimpers
I smoke so many poes that I might catch cancer

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
