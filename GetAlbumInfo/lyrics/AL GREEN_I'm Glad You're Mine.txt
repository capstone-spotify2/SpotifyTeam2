Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah, I'm just so glad you're mine

Whoa, baby, why did it take so long?
Whoa baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine

Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Baby, I'm not gonna leave you alone
Baby, on top of that, I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, so glad you're mine

Hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Woho, boy

I know you'll never say, baby
Baby, I'm gonna turn my back and walk away now
Baby, I'll see you another day, hey baby

I'm so, I'm so
Thankful for your love, angel
Thankful for your love, every day
Glad you're mine
Aw, hey, hey, hey, baby
Hey, hey, hey, thankful for your love
