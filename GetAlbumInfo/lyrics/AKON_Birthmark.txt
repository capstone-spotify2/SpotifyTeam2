I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia Keys verse

I'm falliiinggg for you

I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first so

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart,

(To your heart
To your heart
To your heart)

To your heart

(To your heart
To your heart
To your heart)

To your heart

(To your heart
To your heart
To your heart)

To your heart

(To your heart
To your heart
To your heart)

Get the calendar
Go to august 3rd
First words stay we heard our first words
First argument
Gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds
Flipping pages
Now I'm famous
Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Wishing that I coulda made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first so

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart,

(To your heart
To your heart
To your heart)

To your heart

January, February, March, April, May,
June, July, August is just another day,
September, October, November, trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again

If only we can go
To that place where me and you know,
There's no faith, fronting, cheating, even lying,
The time has come where we stand face to face

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart,

To your heart
To your heart
To your heart

That stamp right next to your heart

(To your heart
