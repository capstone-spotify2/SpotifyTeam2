I'm always short on cash and my mind is in the trash,
can't find a way to get my head outta my ass.
I'm gettin' skinny as a bone 'cause I'm always stuck at home,
I'm livin' my life all fucked up and alone.

So once again, alone in my room,
only apparent future is my unhappy and doom.
So I just whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine,
whine, whine, whine, all the fuckin' time.

Hooked on bad caffeine, unless I get it I'm mean,
can't remember last when I was chipper and clean.
Goin' insane all I do is complain,
the only traits I show are depression and disdain.

So once again, alone in my room,
only apparent future is my unhappy and doom.
So I just whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine,
whine, whine, whine, all the fuckin' time.

The girl I love is going away, there is no way that she'll stay,
don't know how I'm gonna live my life this way.
Don't wanna have to try, I'll just sit around and cry,
maybe if I get lucky, I'll just fuckin' die!

So once again, alone in my room,
only apparent future is my unhappy and doom.
So I just whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine,
whine, whine, whine, all the fuckin' time.
And I whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine,
whine, whine, whine, all the fuckin' time.
