Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...

I know that we have to take it to the goal 'cause everyone's depending on we
See we ain't got nowhere to go but up, it's our destiny

We're choosing the way, we'll do what it takes to get to the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves 'cause we know

Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...

See we'll never be able to forget this day 'cause it's the greatest day of our life
See no matter what happens at least we can say "we came, we saw, we tried"

We're choosing the way, we'll do what it takes to get to the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves 'cause we know

Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...

This is our time to shine, our time to fly, our time to be inside the sky
Our time to soar, our time to score, the last one in football

World wide
World wide
World wide
World wide

Oh Africa...

World wide
World wide
World wide
World wide

Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...
Oh Africa...

Oh Africa...
