Rooftop tonight we are the skyline
Collecting shooting stars wishes in jar
All the hearts wide-awake and lonely
Dream of where we are

Run so fast
The wind canât catch us
Itâs at our back
The sun is falling
Things donât last
When youâre young cause
All you get is
Just one chance to

Break away to beat the odds
All along itâs been a race against the clock
Time wonât wait were gonna leave
Somewhere weâll find infinity
Weâll find infinity

Breaking hearts just for the hell of it
Anything so we can feel dangerous
Everywhere we go we leave shadows from the past
We wonât die young but weâll live fast

Run so fast
The wind canât catch us
Itâs at our back
The sun is falling
Things donât last
When youâre young cause
All you get is
Just one chance to

Break away to beat the odds
All along itâs been a race against the clock
Time wonât wait were gonna leave
Somewhere weâll find infinity
Find infinity
Infinity

Break away to beat the odds
All along itâs been a race against the clock
Time wonât wait were gonna leave
Somewhere weâll find infinity
Break away to beat the odds
All along itâs been a race against the clock
Time wonât wait were gonna leave
Somewhere weâll find infinity
Somewhere weâll find infinity
Weâll find infinity
