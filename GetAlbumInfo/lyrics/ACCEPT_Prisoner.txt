She's a dancer
And she's holdin' on
To dreams of fame

No loser
But in her mind
It's coming apart

It's a felony to me
To give it up - she's gonna lose it
Been holding back on love
Pretending there's no way to turn

She's a prisoner
Got a lot to fight for - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame
Got a lot to fight for - (prisoner)

She's a dreamer
And I imagine her
That she'll be mine

Chasing a dream
The lights they call
Got no love anymore
'cause she gave it all

It's insanity to me
To give it up - she's gonna lose it
She's holding back on love
Pretending there's no way to turn

She's a prisoner
Got a lot to fight for - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame

She's a prisoner
Ooh yeah - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame
(can't you see what's going on)

It's mystic magic - (mystic magic)
Dancing on air - (dancing on air)
Some call it tragic
She's fading - fading away again

(Prisoner) - got a lot to fight for - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame - (can't you see what's going on)
She's a prisoner
Ooh yeah - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame - (can't you see what's going on)

She's Prisoner - got a lot to fight for - (prisoner)
Prisoner - prisoner of fame - (can't you see what's going on)
(prisoner - can't you see what's going on)
(prisoner - can't you see what's going on)

She's a prisoner
Ooh yeah - (prisoner)
(can't you see what's going on)
