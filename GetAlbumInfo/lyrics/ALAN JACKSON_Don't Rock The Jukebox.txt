Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

I ain't got nothin'
Against rock &amp; roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
Ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Ya don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
