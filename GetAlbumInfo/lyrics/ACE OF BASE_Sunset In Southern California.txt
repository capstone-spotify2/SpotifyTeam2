Aaaahhh

All the couples on the beach are tellin' me
Oooh, take me home
I will stand here star-gazing so I might
See a glimpse of someone like you

Sunset in Southern California, aaah
Where the light is low, it's reaching for the night
Sunset in Southern California
In the distance there's the light of San Diego

Where the morning seems so far, so far away
Oh Lord, take me home
And the sea so purple tells me about you
My love, as you are in a

Sunset in Southern California, aaah
Where the light is low, it's reaching for the night
Sunset in Southern California
In the distance there's the light of San Diego

The roaring of the sea
Will tell you about me
I'm not so far away, I'm so much like you
My story is come to an end
I liked you as a friend
But now it's so much more
Oh how I love you

Sunset in Southern California, aaah
Where the light is low, it's reaching for the night
Sunset in Southern California
In the distance there's the light of San Diego

Sunset in Southern California, aaah
Where the light is low, it's reaching for the night
Sunset in Southern California
In the distance there's the light of San Diego
In the distance there's the light of San Diego
Then the light is telling me how much I miss you
