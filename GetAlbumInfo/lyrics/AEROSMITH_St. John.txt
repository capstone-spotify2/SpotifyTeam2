John was bad
He gave it everything he had
John he prayed
For all the people ever made
John was cool
He never did no after school

Late at night when he praised the Lord
He laid his hands down upon the sword

Lay down upon the sword
Lay down upon the sword
Lay down upon the sword
Lay down your bloody sword

John St. John be cool
Tell the people they'll follow you
John St. John be cool
Tell the people they'll follow you

Late at night when he praised the Lord
He lay his hands down upon the bloody sword
Laid down upon the sword, down, down, down upon the sword
Laid down upon the sword, gettin' down upon the sword
Laid down upon the sword, laid down upon the sword
Laid down upon the sword, "Late Night TV Roared"
