I got a reefer headed woman 
She fell right down from the sky 
(Good Lord) 
Woh...I got a reefer head a woman 
She fell right down from the sky 

Well, I gots to drink me a two fifths of whiskey 
Just to get half as high 

When the good Lord made that woman 
He sure went to town 
Oooh...when the good Lord made that woman 
He sure went to town 

Well, when he was feelin' high 
Oooh...he sure should have been feelin' low 

Oh Mr. Perry!
