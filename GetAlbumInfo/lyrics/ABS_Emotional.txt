Oh its still a mystery
How she got me high
Anticipating what
She's gonna do cos I
Can't seem to let it go
Addicted by her drug
Aint got no remedy for this contagious kind of love

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Didn't mean to get emotional
Feel like I'm sinking
It wasn't meant unintentional
I can see what you was thinking
Got a hole in her soul
Thats the shape of a man
Tell me who's your next victim
It aint that she hates ya
Its just her nature
Baby dont misunderstand

I give her what she needs
Don't ever seem enough
Aint got no room to breathe
Feels like a tainted love
I need to get away
Seems as though its been
To belong cos when I try
She pulls me right back in

<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>

Aint nothing left to give
Just a broken shell
Just enough to live
Just enough to tell a tale

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
