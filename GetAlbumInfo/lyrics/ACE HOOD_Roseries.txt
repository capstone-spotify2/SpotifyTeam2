Neck full of rosaries, people say that I'm superstitious
Cripping all on my Jesus piece, chopper sleeping right next to me
Pray to god my soul to keep, keep my home boys out the streets
Keep my bad hoes on a leash,
When I die, bury me
With a neck full of rosaries
With a neck full of rosaries
Pray to god my soul to keep keep my home boys out the streets
Keep my bad hoes on a leash, when I die, bury me
With a neck full of rosaries
With a neck full of rosaries
Going down nothing less then G, do this shit for my family
Shining hard like I'm supposed to be, bury me in my rosaries

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
OK, G code in my bloodline, free my niggas who doing time
Glock hold about sixteen, gun dirty but my dick clean
Lost my dog when I was seventeen, knuckle head he sold dope to fiends
Swear to god that shit hurt me dog, swear to god I went AWOL
And you wonder why I keep my fire tucked, believe in god but don't pray enough
Jesus piece all flooded up, just talked to mom she said she prays for us
If I die tonight, tell my bitch to keep her pussy tight
Tell my niggas they're my niggas till the end
Yeah nigga that's for life
Keep my homies out the street life, then again you gotta eat right
Money low with your pockets tight, kinda hard trying to sleep at night
Paranoid by them flashing lights, knowing fuck niggas want your life
Pussy nigga I ain't the type, real niggas gon' feel me right

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Everyday a nigga trying to get rich
Everyday a nigga fuck a new bitch
What it is in that brand new whip
New watch with a brand new clip
Every day I'm gonna do it for my daughter
Penthouse by the boats and the water
Baby mama still tripping regardless
You fuck niggas still talking out of order
Then I grab that thing, and then I click clack
No killer but don't get a nigga on that
Scared of who I'm gonna see in the city with my top back
Yeah I know you pussy niggas really hate that
And I'm still with my niggas
Bad bitch comes fuck with a nigga
Bitch I'm on TV, but I still know killers
If I die tonight, tell my bitch to keep her pussy tight
Tell my niggas they my niggas till the end
Yeah nigga that's for life
Keep my homies out the street life, then again you gotta eat right
Money low with your pockets tight, real niggas gon' feel me right
