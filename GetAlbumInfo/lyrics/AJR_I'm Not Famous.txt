Where my haters
Where my haters
I don't got em
I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

You never heard of me
Or the weird shit I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no

And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
Cause I'm not famous, no

Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi they don't care where I go

Where my haters
Where my haters
I don't got em
I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

You never overheard
That I blew 20 grand on shirts
Nobody knows my quirks
Cause I'm not famous, no

Everyone got their habits
But you'll never hear what mine is
Best thing bout my life is
I'm not famous, no

Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi they don't care where I go

Where my haters
Where my haters
I don't got em
I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
Go
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
Hate it, Hate Hate it, no
Hate it, Hate Hate it

Where my haters
Where my haters
I don't got em
I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one I'm not famous, no
I'm not, I'm not
And I don't hate it, no

I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
