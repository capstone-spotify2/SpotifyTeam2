Who we are I'll never know
But when we spoke I knew you well
You knew me well
You loved me through and through
I never thought I would watch you leave us
From a room as a kid I held so close
I was a son made up on sand
You were the wind that let me go
I'll say goodbye
So this is goodbye
But I'm afraid to speak
So with words I'll tell the story
You meant so much to me
And like the night upon nights to come
I will dream of you
And know that I will see you seen
Give me the strength to carry on
Tide
You are the ocean tide
The swells swept you away
I was a son made of sand
You were the wind that let me go
When the ocean tide has risen to high
And the waters have come to carry you away
Remember I will always be there to sing you to sleep
