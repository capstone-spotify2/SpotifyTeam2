There's no despair in the world I own
Heard a wise man say
It's hard to take when you lost it all
Get it all back some day

What you're hiding for?
What you're fighting for?
Are you scared now?
What you're fighting for?
What you're hiding for?

There's no war you can overcome
You told me for sure
It's hard to know when darkness comes
What's the hard shell for?

What you're hiding for?
What you're fighting for?
Are you scared now?
What you're fighting for?
What you're hiding for?

Don't give in to your emotions,
'Cause they'll get the best of you
Don't play up to your senses
Yes, they'll probably rule your whole life through
Don't give in to your emotions,
'Cause they'll get the best of you
Yes, they'll probably rule your whole life through
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
