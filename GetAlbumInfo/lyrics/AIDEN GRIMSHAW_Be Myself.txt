Sinners never sleep
Wake up, please, with me
I don't wanna be alone
Take my heart as yours
The hands are pulling me down
No sound, I'm drowning... drowning...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Be, gotta be myself, I gotta be, gotta be myself
No one else
Gotta be, gotta be myself, for a while
Gotta be, gotta be myself
I gotta be, gotta be myself
No one else
Gotta be, gotta be myself, just for now

If I jumped in too deep
Gave you all of me
In accidental scenes, catching tales, and dreams
Demons at my door
No sound I'm drowning... drowning...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Be, gotta be myself, I gotta be, gotta be myself
No one else
Gotta be, gotta be myself, for a while
Gotta be, gotta be myself
I gotta be, gotta be myself
No one else
Gotta be, gotta be myself, just for now...
