Your gone but love love is still here baby
Your making each day seem like a year
Baby baby loneliness has got me uptight 
There ain't a sign of happiness in sight
Now now now what am I gonna do with myself
I wanna know wanna know wanna know right now
I cant I tried it and I cant love nobody else
Now baby baby baby yeah yeah

Each night I toss oh baby turn in my bed 
I cry cry cry so much baby till my eyes are all red
Without you something existed you got everything my heart is missing
Tell me baby 

What lord lord am I gonna do with myself 
I wanna know wanna know wanna know right now
I cant baby cant love nobody else 
Cause I tried and tried baby
No no

Baby calling
Baby everything my heart desires
But now what somebody somebody help me baby baby baby
