<i>[Kayla:]</i> Give me a world that's equal on all sides
<i>[Aaron:]</i> Let freedom flow as constant as the tides
<i>[Kayla:]</i> I pray with each sunset, don't forget to rise
<i>[Aaron:]</i> (Don't forget to rise)
<i>[Kayla:]</i> I live without regret
<i>[Both:]</i> For ordinary lives

<i>[Both:]</i> I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes

<i>[Aaron:]</i> I see a land with liberty for all
<i>[Kayla:]</i> Yet still I know the truth will rise and fall
<i>[Aaron:]</i> (Oooh yeah-yeh)
That's just the way it goes
<i>[Both:]</i> A word now to the wise
The world was made to change
Each day is a surprise

<i>[Both:]</i> Lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
Looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes

<i>[Both:]</i> And I know when you're looking for the truth
(Mmmhmm)
If you go and read between the lines
You'll discover how and why

<i>[Aaron (rap):]</i> I take my heart into battle
Give that freedom bell a rattle
Get my independence signed
Declare it on the dotted line
In Philidelphia freedom ring
And patriotic voices sing
Red White &amp; Blue never give up
We represent America

<i>[Both:]</i> I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes
