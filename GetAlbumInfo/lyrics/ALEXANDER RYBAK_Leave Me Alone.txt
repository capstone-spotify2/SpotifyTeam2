"I want to be admitted, please. There's a crazy girl following me."

It started with a call I stupidly answered
You said you got my number from one of the dancers
You waited right outside, you had something on mind
But then I saw your eyes, your crazy eyes

Now you got me into something very sick and twisted
An evil kind of game I didn't know existed
You traveled overseas to terrorize me
And I don't understand, why can't you let me be?

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool!
You're scaring me to death, that's not cool!
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!

I beg of you to stop and think this through
It's time you started playing with someone new
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!

You're scaring mom and dad, scaring off my girlfriend
You're waiting by my door early in the morning
I've told you many times, don't follow me at night
You're poisoning in my life, just tell me why!

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool!
You're scaring me to death, that's not cool!
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!

I beg of you to stop and think this through
It's time you started playing with someone new
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool!
You're scaring me to death, that's not cool!
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!

I beg of you to stop and think this through
It's time you started playing with someone new
Why won't you leave me alone?
Just leave me alone!
You're crazy, leave me alone!
