I just did my verses and I think I need some AdLibs
Just to get you dabbing
Dabbing to the AdLib

Dabbing to the AdLib

We don't sing along if you didn't do the Dablibs
Based on a true story

Crazy way to start a song huh
You niggas prolly thought you wouldn't get the work huh
I've been out the hood, tell me what's the word bra
I heard ain't shit changed still these niggas hate the boy huh
Fuck em all
I got other shit to focus on
Still ignore em
I don't owe em shit
Man I'm on my own
Getting more vicious with the hits, better than before
My new song is really with the shits, toilet paper roll
I'm advancing and I know you see it
They ain't talking about the thong when they say their city
I say it on the microphone, while you niggas tweet it
Either you got it or you don't
Ain't nothing between it, oh God
Ain't no love for that other squad, Hell naw
Ain't no love for them other guys
Open up you eyes, look through em, see the other side
Man you'll realize the whole tiiiiime
