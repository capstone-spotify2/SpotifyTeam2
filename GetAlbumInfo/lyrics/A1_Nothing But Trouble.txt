Let me tell you about this girl that once was mine
Once upon a time she's nothing but trouble. 

Up till now, was a man of common senses. 
Funny on how I just give up on my defenses, but she's one of a kind. 
Just a girl that could easily twist your mind, but right now it feels so fine.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
She's nothing but trouble
Trouble's her name. 
She's driving me crazy, it's kind of insane. 
I'm searching for reason, to let her go. 
Cause somewhere inside of me I know. She's nothing but trouble.

Everyone says I'll playing a game with fire, it's too late I'll just caught up my desire.
Cause she's one of a kind, just a girl that could easily twist your mind. 
But right now it feels so fine.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When I look in her eyes, it's just hard to anyone's advice. 
But somewhere I realize.
<i>[Chorus: Repeat Till End]</i>
