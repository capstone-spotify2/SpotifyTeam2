As I lay by your side and hold you tonight
I want you to understand,
This love that I feel is so right and so real,
I realize how lucky I am.
And should you ever wonder if my love is true,
There's something that I want to make clear to you.

There's no way I can make it without you,
There's no way that I'd even try.
If I had to survive without you in my life,
I know I wouldn't last a day.
Oh babe, there's no way.

It means so much to me whenever I see
That 'wanting me look' in your eyes.
I don't know how I could do without
Holding you close every night.
I've waited so long just to have you to hold.
Now that I've got you,
I'll never let go.

There's no way I can make it without you.
There's no way that I'd even try.
If I had to survive without you in my life,
I know I wouldn't last a day.
Oh babe, there's no way.

I never knew until you
What I was missing.
Now you say "Forever."
I find my heart, it's listening,
Yes, I'm listening.

There's no way I can make it without you.
There's no way that I'd even try.
If I had to survive without you in my life,
I know I wouldn't last a day.
Oh babe, there's no way.

Baby, there's just no way.
