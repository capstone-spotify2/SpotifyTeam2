Girls
(Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)
I like the girls
(Ay, loco, sing that one more time sound good, 'cuz)
Girls, yeah
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
I like the girls
(Give me a light, loc, a tell that girl over there
My name is Afroman)

I like 'em short, I like 'em tall
I like 'em big, I like 'em small
I like 'em with hair, I like 'em bald
To make a long story short, I like 'em all

I like this girl, I like that girl
I like the skinny girl, I like the fat girl
I like the college girl and the hoodie rat too
I like the church girl Ms. 'Goodie Goodie Two Shoes'

Girls
(I like the girls, sing it ya'll)
I like the girls
(You know I do, I'm so in love with you)
Girls
(Oh, baby)
I like the girls
(You gotta understand, I can't operate with no man)

I like 'em shy, I like 'em bold
I like 'em young, I like 'em old
I like 'em smart, I like 'em dumb
I like women anyway they come

Man, I like 'em when they're beautiful
I like 'em when they're ugly
I like it when they ignore me
I like it when they bug me
Ain't a woman that I don't like
I got drunk one time and tried to talk to a dyke

Girls
(I love the girls, yeah)
I like the girls
(Adam gave up his rib so I could take
A hot mama back the crib)
Girls
(I love you, baby, yeah)
I like the girls
(Hey, lady, I'm the hungry hustler Afroman)

I like the wrong girl, I like the right girl
I like the black girl, I like the white girl
I like the brown girl, I like the yellow girl
I like the rich girl, I like the ghetto girl

I like the nice girl, I like the mean girl
Outer space, I even got a green girl
I like the city girl, I like the country girl
Don't let me get high and get the munchies, girl

Girls
(When I'm 99, I'ma have me a woman that's fine)
I like the girls
(Make love and have a heart attack
Cum and go at the same time)
Girls
(Afroman, yeah, Afroman)
I like the girls

Ay man, I wrote this rap about Little Red Riding Hood
When I was a little kid, check it out, man

I met Lil' Red Riding hood
We took a ride to my hood and I rode her real good
Like Martin Luther King, I have a dream
To make Red Riding Hood holler and scream

I said, ?Boom, bang, pop, pow
Grandmama can't help ya now
When you're on all fours like a horse on her hoof
I'm Afroman, the Big Bad Wolf?

Girls
(Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)
I like the girls
(A both, y'all say yeah, yeah)
Girls
(I like the girls)
I like the girls
(You know why? 'Cause I'm a locsta, locsta hundred spokesta)

Girls, they gotta be the most precious commodity
My brain's like the ocean but nothing is swimming
Through my head except naked women
Of course I wanna have sex with you

Do I look like I'm a homosexual?
All you feminists hate my guts
But girl, you gonna love these nuts

Girls
(Yeah, we gonna break it down, you understand me)
I like the girls
(All my G-mosobies up there in Pimp-dale, Pimp-afornia)
Girls
(I'm smokin' tumbleweed with all my homies from
Haddeys-herb Missi-hempie)
I like the girls
(Ay, man, check out this song we used to
Sing when we was little kids, right)

My girl got two big lips, taste like potato chips
My girl got two big boobs just like two inter tubes
My girl got two big hips just like two battleships
My girl got real long hair down to her underwear

My girl gotta slender waste
Her favorite seat is on my face
I got taste, I got taste
