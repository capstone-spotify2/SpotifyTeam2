Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
baby with a lonely kind of life to lead
my mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted
they left her to be trusted till the orphan bleeds
but when she cried at night, no one came
and when she cried at night, went insane

Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
that she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
but soon she found her mother's love for all the others
the pushers and the shovers was the life to lead
but when she cried at night, no one came
and when she cried at night, went insane

oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
oooh, oh yeah
oooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah

now she's doin any for money and a penny
a sailor with a penny or two or three
hers is the cunning for men who come a-runnin'
they all come for fun and it seems to me
that when she cried at night, no one came
and when she cried at night, went insane

oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window <i>[x1,000,000]</i>
