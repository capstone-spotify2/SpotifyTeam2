Uh, its me double x 
Commin' threw cashin' more than a couple cheques (uh huh)
Gotta a maserati, gave my niece bubble x (yeah)
And don't even need to guess, its mine (Yup)
And I don't even need a dime (Nope)
Keep all your dames in line (okay)
Chanel keep my wriste on time (yeah)
Chanel, that your girl cant find

So go on and on over girl and watch your hips unwind 
Feelin kinda good
Yea,
Got my lips greased all up
Oo my lips all up
Whenever she can't I could
Don't need your black card 
Cause after this verse I'm good

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[J-5]</i>
One step, two step, three to go
One step, two step, three to go
One step, two step, three to go
Now you got J-5 and we out the door
Boys in the mist cause its sweatin the floor
See the Chinese laundrys on the floor
Put all my dirty laundry behind the door
Why you put the allionka on my ear lobe
And now get get the follow
Came by me cause you already get low

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[J-5]</i>
Sin so sexy with my beautiful necklace
Straight vibe encrested
On my chain embreasted
Body's so dangerous go on and rest it
Make bond it money that's my fetish
This it how I gave you one
Number tone for fun
Give it ?? just for some
This ain't for everybody, just for some
June fifth be the chosen song

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Ooooooo
I wanna be your savior tonite
Ooooooo
Just let me save you girl
