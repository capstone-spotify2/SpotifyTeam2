Your momma told me read the book of Job
They shoulda called it the book of soul
I came into this hurtful earth in perfect health
Caught Steven Johnson syndrome when I was ten years old
Internal and external fever
80% fatality rate at that time
Ain't that some shit
Severe pink eye
My eyes swollen shut
For like two or three months
It still bright as fuck
And I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than it's original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check
The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'm alright
My first years of junior high school were not alright
Them dimes wouldn't give me no time
No, not a nod
I mean not even you
We eventually got cool
But I was nobody
You was the hottest hottie in the school
But the world to me
Not saying that cause I'm your dude
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed too
Ironic we always had the same classes
I copied off your work
And you ain't always had the right answers but it worked
Mama, thanks a lot
Probably wouldn't have graduated had you not
Somewhere down the line, we became an item
The love was in the air like this flight I'm lightin'
The first few years was so excitin'
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
My money got funny
You wanted to go on dates
I had a Soundwave beat tape tryna be Drake
Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it
For me and you
You sing too so you knew the business
I know it was hard but you stayed down
My fam had doubts
You told me you was proud
I did some things, you did some things
Always came back together
We knew the only way to make it work was work together
Seven whole years, seven whole years
It was supposed to end with our grandkids
Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short
But I'm such a nice guy, why Lord?
Why Lori?
Why'd you have to take her from me?
Guess you needed your angel face for all of heaven to see
Your picture still on my mirror and it's so scary
I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now I'm so doped up I think I'm flying
I hope the spliff will never finish
I guess the Mayans wasn't lying
2012 my world ended
You used to say that I could see the future
You was wrong, cause you was in it
And I was just with you the day before
You said you loved me, I said I loved you more
And as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu
And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you
I gotta stay cause I remember that day I looked you in the face and told you nothing can stop me
Not even you
Stick to the plan
I'll meet you at our spot
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I never lied
I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme
Signed
Sincerely yours
I live to let you
Shine

<i>[Interlude]</i>

Everything I love most get taken away
My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Curt Cobain
I still believe in God, we jut ain't never spoke
Unless we talkin symbolically then I might agree
But if you really wanna look at it that way then
Hey man
God don't like me
I refuse to believe that
But what's acceptable is anything's possible
But nobody special
My ma took my TV, - took my radio
Now I'm on TV and on the radio

Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and keep them locks off your soul <i>[x2]</i>

(Soul!)
