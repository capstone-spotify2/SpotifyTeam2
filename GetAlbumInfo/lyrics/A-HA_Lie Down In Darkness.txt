With all our goals and destinations...
Everything must be this way
Vague are hopes
That try our patience
Listen now to what I say

Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Here with me

All our trials and tribulations...
Will it ever make much sense 
All these years
They disappear
They leave me here
Without defense

Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Here with me
