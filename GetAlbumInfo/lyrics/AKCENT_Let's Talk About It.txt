Oh, I told you right from the start
I don't wanna be the one who's breaking your heart
No, I'm not that kind that's giving up
Tell me if I'm crazy, but you're everything I've got

Oh, let's just talk about it
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home
Oh, let's just talk about it
I want you to love me don't leave me alone
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home

Oh, you know what they say is true
We will be just fine if you got me and I got you
No, I don't need somebody else
Baby all I need from you is just a second chance

Oh, let's just talk about it
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home
Oh, let's just talk about it
I want you to love me don't leave me alone
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home

Oh, let's just talk about it
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home
Oh, let's just talk about it
I want you to love me don't leave me alone
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home

Oh, let's just talk about it
I want you to love me don't leave me alone
Oh, let's just talk about it
This song is about you so please come back home
