I'm infected... I'm infected... 
By your genetics.

Shilo, I'm the doctor.
Shilo, I'm your father.
Shilo, that was close.
Take your medicine.
I'm infected by your genetics.

Shilo, you're my patient.
Shilo, be more patient.
You have limitations.
Don't go chasing flies.
I must be protective.
You cannot be reckless
That's what is expected
When you are infected.

I'm infected by your genetics.
I'm infected by your genetics, 
And I don't think that I can be fixed.
No, I don't think that I can be fixed.
Tel me why, oh why, are my genetics such a bitch?

It's this blood condition! 
Damn this blood condition! 
Mother, can you hear me?
Thanks for the disease! 
Now I am sequestered.
Part of the collection.
That's what is expected
When you are infected.

That's what is expected
When you are infected.
That's what is expected
When you are infected.

How much of it's genetics?
How much of it is fate?
How much of it depends on the choices that we make?
He says I have her eyes, 
Do I also inherit his shame?
Is heredity the culprit?
Can I stop it? Or am I a slave?

I'm infected by your genetics.
I'm infected by your genetics.
What hope has a girl who is sick?
Why dream of a life past this fence?
It really makes no difference, 
'Cause I know that I'll never be fixed
Tell me why, oh why, are my genetics such a bitch! 

But oh, I want to go outside, outside... 
But oh, I want to go outside, outside...
