I can't figure this out
I'm stuck on this cloud
And I don't think I'm crazy
I am never coming down

He makes my heart pound
Yeah he's so amazing
I never thought somebody
Like you really existed

Close my eyes and
Make a wish
He must be an angel, angel

He must an angel
Falling down, yeah

He must be an angel
Got me an angel

F-F-falling from the heaven above
Take me with you
To, heaven <i>[x3]</i> yeah

He's always on cue he know just what to do
To, make me feel so good
And when he comes around

I'm all upside down
And I feel like I cant breath
And I feel like I cant breath

I never thought somebody
Like you really existed

Close my eyes and
Make a wish
He must be an angel, angel

He must an angel
Falling down, yeah

He must be an angel
Got me an angel

F-F-falling from the heaven above
Take me with you
To, heaven <i>[x3]</i> yeah

Don't know what he did
But I cant get him out
Of my mind
He must be an angel
