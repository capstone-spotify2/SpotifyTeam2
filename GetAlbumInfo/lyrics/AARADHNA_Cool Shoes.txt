The man at the door, 6 foot 4
Just told me that I canât get in
He said that it was closing
But he was only lying

âCause it was only open for his friends
I came to have a good time
Wanted to spin my edge, Yes I did
But had me feeling like I wasnât good enough to come in

Hey big boy I guess youâve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, youâre rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess youâve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ainât cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang

The girl with the smoky eyes dipped in the skewer reminiscing over mocking birds
Sheâs a birdie that likes to mock and just talks talks talks
That messed up

Oh, she doesnât gets it
Because she thinks she perfect
And everyone to rock will think sheâs right

Well let me tell you something
That karma is a bitch
And when it comes to rock 
Youâre gonna feel that chick

Hey big boy I guess youâve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, youâre rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess youâve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ainât cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang

The cast outs, the bullied arounds
The ones that got chased out of town
The cats that always got put down
The longer theyâre away, they come back around

I promise youâre gonna see your better days
I promise it wonât always be this way
So let them fools believe that they could
Cause one day theyâre gonna walk in your shoes

Hey big boy I guess youâve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, youâre rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess youâve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ainât cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang

Hey big boy I guess youâve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, youâre rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess youâve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ainât cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
