It ainât hard to tell, I excel and prevail
Young niggas rising hell but talk well
Make sales, I managed to re-fake jail
Blast on the road to success was unpaved land
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons
Never get caught sleeping, Iâd rather be caught dreaming
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall Tâs
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering
How they even heard of me
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots my way
Couldâve been the worst that I shot then say
Across the bear hoes you never got complain
One day, though, some day is on
One day youâre here, next day youâre gone

Wake up with the fear of living for another day
Tell myself that itâs nothing that I canât take
Your strength is the sickness I canât hide
I try to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hellâs fury feeds the fear inside

Itâs like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Itâs a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

I made choices that I cannot live with
I regret not choosing over him
Iâm suffocating in this life
Donât know if I can survive this weather
And you turn up with your arms and umbrella
I send a farewell tonight

Itâs like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Itâs a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

My life could be a movie let me write the script
It would be something truly never read like a crypt
Learn it with clothes full of hoes like a pimp
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick?
Only bad hoes getting shows for the tricks
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe
Second thought, fuck it, ainât nobody gonna play me
Yo, some day is on, one day youâre here, next day youâre gone
One day youâre here, next day youâre gone

I know the risk has come, I know I can run into your arms
I know youâll come to save me from harm
Itâs like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Itâs a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover
