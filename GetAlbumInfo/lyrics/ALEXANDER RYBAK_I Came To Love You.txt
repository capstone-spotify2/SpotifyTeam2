When you're away
I try to focus on things
I need to do
but my hands are shakin',
cause I'm just mad about you.

When by myself
I think of all that may
or may not be true.
And I'm scared of falling
falling hard without you.

But then I see your smile.
And suddenly I feel stronger,
I feel proud.
that's when I man up.
And girl, there's a thing I gotta say out loud.

You got my heart.
Baby, I know this time it's true
So I came to love you.
And that's what I'm gonna do.

And I just hope,
deep in your heart
you feel it too.
Cause I came to love you,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

When we're apart
I walk around all day with your name in my heart
And I can't stop dreamin'
the sweetest dreams about you.

I lay awake when you're not in my bed.
Because I can't get you out of my head
And I feel so foolish.
The biggest fool without you.

But then I see your smile
and all the sudden I'm happy, strong and proud.
That's when I man up.
Girl, do you mind if I say this out loud.

You got my heart.
Baby, I know this time it's true
So I came to love you.
And that's what I'm gonna do.

And I just hope,
deep in your heart
you feel it too.
Cause I came to love you,
and that's what I'm gonna do.
