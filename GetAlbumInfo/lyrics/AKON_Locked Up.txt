<i>[AKON]</i>
Im steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do?,
Freedom aint gettin no closer,
No matter how far I go,
My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops patrolin, and now they done stop me,
And I get locked up,

<i>[Chorus]</i>
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

<i>[Akon]</i>
Headin up town to re-up,
Back with a couple keys,
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as feens,
Makin so much money,
Products movin' fast,
Put away the stash,
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (baby girl I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Cuz visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me,
Commissary is getting empty,
My cell mates getting food without me,
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life,
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
They won't let me out, they won't let me out,
(ohhh I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out,
(my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Maybe a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Maybe a visit baby (they won't let me out)
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
Wheres my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no.
Get me outta here (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, they won't let me out.
Baby Im locked up they won't let me out, no
Where's my niggaz?
On the lock-down.
Damn, I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
Ohhh... they won't let me out.
Can you please accept my phone calls?
Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up.
