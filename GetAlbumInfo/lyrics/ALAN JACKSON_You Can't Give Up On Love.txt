You say you're heart's been broken
and you just can't win
you say that you'll never find love again
let me tell you friend

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love

looked out my window and what did I see?
it's another broken family
the kids are stayin' with mama at home
daddy's livin in a house all alone

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love

troubled times make it hard to stay
so many lovers take the easy way
but don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
cause everday can't be a honeymoon

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love

no you can't give up on love
oh you can't give up on love
