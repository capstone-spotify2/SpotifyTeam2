Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag 
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin 
Out take's short breaks 
Love her 'til the earth quakes 

Stand on the seashore lookin' at the city 
See the street light, dog bite your lady on the titty 
At the wax museum everybody cares to see themselves 
As others care to see you but nobody wants to be you baby 

Corn bread, cabbage head 
Try and get a side of me 
Hold my pickle, hold your lettuce 
Special orders don't upset us 

Kickstand face, looks so evil like knieval 
Never make third base like a tongue in my old lady 
Like a squatez vous and a domo arigato 
Tip my hat to you rock a roller obbligatto 

Stage show come in stride, smoke a bone i'm feelin' fine 
Girls in heat will try and get us
Hash in bones won't upset us 

He need cash....Kick in the pants 
Wantin' for....Gotta dance 
Say it ahh....To you to give us the chance 

Ain't gonna do it...ain't gonna do it
Ain't gonna do it...ain't gonna do it
Ain't gonna do it...ain't gonna do it
Ain't gonna do it...ain't gonna do it
Ain't gonna do it...ain't gonna do it 
And then sounds that only the "man" Steven Tyler can make!
