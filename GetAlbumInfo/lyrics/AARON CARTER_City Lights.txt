I turn off the radio
All the windows down
Still seems like your right here beside me
Down every back street
Thereâs a memory
Canât believe the way, I still see your face in everything

It wonât stop, no matter where Iâm runninâ
You donât stop, your love just keeps on hauntinâ me
I canât stop, forgetting that itâs over
But still Iâm never alone

Under the city lights, thereâs nowhere to get away
Itâs like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasinâ me
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (city lights)

Look for the sunrise, live for the daylight
Thatâs the only time I find that youâre not right on my mind
Donât let the sun go down cause thatâs when it happens
Itâs getting closer, I feel it cominâ tonight

It wonât stop, no matter where Iâm runninâ
You donât stop, your love just keeps on hauntinâ me
I canât stop, forgettinâ that itâs over
But still Iâm never alone

Under the city lights, thereâs nowhere to get away
Itâs like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasinâ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (Ohhh, city lights)

The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovinâ the night

Under the city lights, thereâs nowhere to get away
Itâs like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasinâ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
(Let me go, set me free) 
The city lights
(Ohhh, city lights)
(let me go, set me free)

The city lights
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovinâ the night
