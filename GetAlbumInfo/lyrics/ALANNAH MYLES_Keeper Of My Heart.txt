Make me a necklace of carnelian
Buy me some ribbons for my hair
I will change like a chameleon
If you show me that you care

Take a deep breath of this virtue
Remember who your princess is
Your smile will be the guardian
Of all my weaknesses

Will you be the keeper of my heart
Will you be what time has not forgot
When I have fallen from your grace
Will you be what time cannot erase
Will you be the keeper baby
Will you hide the darkness deep
Will you be the keeper of my heart

I rest my gaze upon this ocean
Buried deep inside your eyes
I'm a slave to my emotions
The innocence that lies

And when the winds of change have broken baby
Every battle, every bough
Will your anger be unspoken
On the twilight of this vow

Will you be the keeper of my heart
Will you be what time has not forgot
When I have fallen from your grace
Will you be what time cannot erase
Will you be the keeper baby
Will you hide the darkness deep
Will you be the keeper of my heart

Will you be the keeper of my heart
Will you be what time has not forgot
When I have fallen from your grace
Will you be what time cannot erase
Will you be the keeper baby
Will you hide the darkness deep
Will you be the keeper of my heart

Will you be the keeper baby
Will you hide the darkness deep
Will you be in my heart
