Raw backwards on all you rappers...

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
What's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
I'm low-key, like a locksmith
Working on both knees
You nosy, wire tap bands
Got fur on where my toes be
I'm cosy
Act like you know me
Wicked as Aleister Crowley
I just might OD
Overly dedicated, just like my homie
Second to none in the first place, I need a trophy
Doing whatever I please, it's like fuck your feelings
Man I got so many flows, them shits come with ceilings
What's my name? They call me Ab-Soul, the abstract asshole
I'm levitating, way too crazy
Way too wavy for your sandcastle

Ay man what's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
The backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

<i>[Zacari:]</i>
We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
I'm going loco
This nigga Soulo back in this hoe though
Oh no you watchin' Hulu, I run the show tho
Is it music? Voodoo? I don't know
But don't confuse me with D'Angelo
I'm the angel of
Spooky, hope your army got lots of armor
Cuz we don't die, we just multiply, divide and conquer
Remember when the battle mongers called me a reject
'Till I had all this heart and honor, demand my respect
Now I walk through C-A-R-son like I'm a hero
Steps ahead and stacking bread up, speaking of heroes
47 shit, fuck it, fly to the Beast Coast
Just to sag down Troy Ave. quoting King Steelo
Pass the pot, let me skill it
The temperature is scalding
The novices make me nauseous
I was like a swami of Jay Electronica until he
Figured Dizzle wouldn't admit that he would body him for a milli
I told Kenny keep quiet, I'ma get him
We don't need dirt on your hands getting the key to the city ya feel me
Hurts when your OG, who is supposed to be a G-O-D
Is standing next to King Kunta feeling like Toby
Moos what I gotta do boy?
I'm just waiting on your cue to take him to school boy!
Fuck all this wordplay
Top, tell these fucking stooges I'm dangerous, keep away!
Mayday

Ay man what's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
The backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

I'm Wiccan like a wicked witch I need Alia Zin
To read Genesis
'Cause this one for my fellow Thelemites
About that fucking life
You fucking right, I need to
Stand up for my fucking rights
Out of sight, out of mind
Still leave insight in your brain
Got your synapses doing jumping jacks and all kind of things
I mean check my subject range
Agartha, Dopamine, choppers, stick talk, Benihana, PF Chang's
Revelations reiterated
This revolutionary
Shit you bump that gives you goosebumps
'Cause the truth is scary
Do What Thou Wilt
I'm not talented, I'm skilled
I'm the darkest knight, with the shiniest shield
Would've attended to university, but it was silly to me
Because the whole universe is just a city to me
