One, two, three
That's how elementary it's gonna be, just fine and dandy
It's easy like taking candy from a baby.

Primitive country
Rich in minerals, you pay them with beads, tip the generals
It's easy, like taking candy from a baby.

The hard part is learning about it
The hard part is breaking through to the truth
The hard part is learning to doubt what you read, what you hear, what you see on the news.

Foreign policy
Made above my head, well, no one asked me, they just laughed and said
It's easy (it's so easy) like taking candy from a baby
It's easy (it's so easy) like taking candy from a baby.

(One, two three, aaah)
(One, two three, aaah)

Once they get you sucked into the system
Once they get you under control
The hard part is knowing how to resist
The grip that they keep on your mind and your soul.

So in the end
We just compromise and pretend if you close your eyes
It's easy (it's so easy) like taking candy from a baby
It's easy (it's so easy) like taking candy from a baby.
