Peace is here
Fear is gone
Love has come
Hope has dawned

Peace is here
Fear is gone
Love has come
Hope has dawned

He will be our sanctuary
Let our hearts not be afraid
Dwelling here with us forever
Jesus Christ is born today

Mary sings a lullaby
Love is born
Is Holy Night

He will be our sanctuary
Let our hearts not be afraid
Dwelling here with us forever
Jesus Christ is born today

Hallelujah
Forever lasting Light
Hallelujah

He will be our sanctuary
Let our hearts not be afraid
Dwelling here with us forever
Jesus Christ is born today
