He broke your heart,
And he tore your dreams in two.
And he kissed a bottom-feedinâ sucker-fish
In front of you.
Deep down you knew that it was never gonna last,
âCuz heâs a piece of stink-bait,
Always actinâ like a bass and,
Now youâre thinkinâ
Your ship is slowly sinkinâ.
Youâre stayinâ up all night long,
Drowninâ in your drinkinâ.
Before you give up,
Get your rear back in the water.
Dance a jig,
Jitterbug,
Or tie on a hula popper.

Then you throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know youâll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!

Now you heard the girl heâs kissinâ
Is stirrinâ up a wake.
Sayin she hooked you good,
And threw you right back in the lake.
Just remember what your mama said,
About sticks and rocks.
Even though youâd like to smack her
With your metal tackle box,

You gotta throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know youâll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!

So donât say farewell to forever,
Like happy ever after ainât never gonna work.
Donât you throw the towel in,
The last one you drug in
Was just a state record-breakinâ
Large-mouth jerk.

You gotta throw out a line,
Reel it back in
If you catch a boot
You gotta cast it out again
You know youâll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry
So get back in that boat and,

Throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know youâll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!

Yeah, get back in that boat and fish!

Girl, get back in that boat,
And fish!
