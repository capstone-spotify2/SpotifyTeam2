It is about time?
Oh yes it is, it really is!
Let's get this party started!
My hands are shaking...
Just take a drink, steady your nerves.
Let's get this party started!

Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to die?
Cause lately it seems I'm going insane!

Please don't get up!
Oh no, you're fine right there!
Just don't mind me as I take you all in!
So drink 'em up, oh yes just slam 'em down!
Have one on me as I lock you all in!
My sweet little sheep your wolf has come...

You should know I'm dangerous.
My thirst for blood turns me on...
How sweet...

Is this what we pictured the night that we said, "you're the one"?
I'm going crazy without you.
It's hard to believe but I'm having fun.

Annabel, look what you've started!

The knife slides down to the tip of my tongue.
I'm finding pleasure in watching you writhe.
I lean in just to lick the sweat off your face.
I taste the reverence dripping down my throat.

You should know I'm dangerous.
My thirst for blood turns me on...
How sweet...

Is this what we pictured the night that we said, "you're the one"?
I'm going crazy without you.
It's hard to believe but I'm having fun.

Annabel, look what you've started!

Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to run?
I've been waiting patiently for this...
Are you ready to die?
There is definitely something wrong!
Will they scream?
Will they cry?
Will they beg as they die or have to accept that this is the end?

Are you ready to die? Are you ready to die? Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to die?!
I'm so glad that all of you came!
Looking in I see a lonely man etching tallies into the bar.
Looking on I see a desperate man repeating something to the floor.
Oh how blood turns me on...
So sweet...

Is this what we pictured the night that we said, "you're the one"?
I'm going crazy without you.
It's hard to believe but I'm having fun.

Annabel, look what you've started!
