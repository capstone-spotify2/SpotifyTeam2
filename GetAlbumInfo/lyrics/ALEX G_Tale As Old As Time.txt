Mislead by your judgement
I never thought that this would go just the way I wanted
Thought it'd be a downward spiral
Should've looked at it with the glass half open

Sparks flying in the backyard you can see my heart through me transparency
But you caught me off my guard and there's no place else I'd rather be in

You said what they say doesn't mean a thing
That's something that before I would never believe

You can hide behind your beautiful eyes
And maybe hypnotize
But the truth never lies
You get me every time	
When I'm here with you it's unspeakable	
Never thought we'd be living in a tale as old as time	
Sounds cheesy but I fell in your eyes and I hope you fell for mine	

I'm much weaker than before don't know what came over me
Acting like a child
See, I'm not used to being so confused and
I used to be on top of my game now I'm a lost cause and I'm bathed in shame
Well, shouldn't never came closer when you looked at me now I'm in far too deep but

You said what they say doesn't mean a thing
That's something that before I would never believe

You can hide behind your beautiful eyes
And maybe hypnotize
But the truth never lies
You get me every time
When I'm here with you it's unspeakable	
Never thought we'd be living in a tale as old as time	
Sounds cheesy but I fell in your eyes and I hope you fell for mine	
Oh I hope you fell	
I hope you fell for mine oh	

You can hide behind your beautiful eyes
Maybe hypnotize but the truth never lies
You get me every time
When I'm here with you it's unspeakable
Never thought we'd be living in a tale as old as time
Sounds cheesy but I fell in your eyes

You can hide behind your beautiful eyes
And maybe hypnotize but the truth never lies
You get me every time
When I'm here with you it's unspeakable
Never thought we'd be living in a tale as old as time
Sounds cheesy but I fell in your eyes
And I hope you fell for mine
(I hope you fell for mine)
