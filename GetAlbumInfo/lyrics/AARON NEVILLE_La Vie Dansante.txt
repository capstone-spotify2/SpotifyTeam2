They can come take it all away
Break you heart by the light of day
Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely

See the ships heading for the rocks
See the time melting over the clocks
There's a light shadows all the rocks that saves me
It saves me

That's why I wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want
La vie dansante

Miss the beat if you close your eyes
Every night wears a new disguise

And I live when a new surprise surrenders

Feel it all with a willing heart
Every stop, there's a place to start
If you know how to play the part with feeling
I play with feeling

Why don't you wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you want

La vie dansante

That's why I wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want
La vie dansante
