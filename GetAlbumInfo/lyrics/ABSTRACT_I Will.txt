I think about the last time I felt, yeah
Then I think about everyone I helped
Could it be the hand I was dealt, yeah
And if I got to do this all by myself
I will

If I got to keep surviving or fighting
With my head above the clouds
And if I got to keep on showing or riding
I will
Every time it seems I'm gonna have more chance
All my friends begin to doubt
Now whenever I'm told I won't or I can't
I will, yeah

I've been living in my own head
Demons living in my own bed
These days I don't trip on what nobody said
There ain't shit I gotta prove to anybody yeah
I became a motivator, a style innovator
Now we headed up like we on a elevator
They say my tracks hot both sides of the equator
And I'm never talking magazines till I'm on the fader
But I know I'm hard on myself, say it ain't good for my health
In the moment ain't finding wealth
Feels like every time I make a move I'm moving in stealth
No matter what I do it feel like nothing will help
Till I get that apartment up in the rainiest city
Working on beats in the morning, performing later that night
Fly out with Drumma Craig and Blulake on a red eye flight
We'll be playing a new city every god damn night (Let's go!)

I think about the last time I felt, yeah
Then I think about everyone I helped
Could it be the hand I was dealt, yeah
And if I got to do this all by myself
I will

If I got to keep surviving or fighting
With my head above the clouds
And if I got to keep on showing or riding
I will
Every time it seems I'm gonna have more chance
All my friends begin to doubt
Now whenever I'm told I won't or I can't
I will, yeah

Wonder why I'm locked in my room
Wonder why I ain't texting back
Wonder why I ain't on the town
Wonder why you heard I was home but you ain't seen me around
I been working writing plotting knocking watching or reading
Ain't taken for granted a single minute I'm breathing
You know I'm working to get it till the day I ain't stressing
Believe in putting effort even when you know it's been destined
I got questions, I need answers
Violence spreading like a cancer
Trying make a difference
Through this music business know I can
I got fans who overseas, I'm just trying give em hope
But if I ain't ever heard they ain't ever gonna know
I know music therapeutic more than anybody man
We got problems in the states, state of problems outta hand
But if they lend an ear think I could lend em a chance
Cause I got faith in the world, I put my faith in my fans

I think about the last time I felt, yeah
Then I think about everyone I helped
Could it be the hand I was dealt, yeah
And if I got to do this all by myself
I will

If I got to keep surviving or fighting
With my head above the clouds
And if I got to keep on showing or riding
I will
Every time it seems I'm gonna have more chance
All my friends begin to doubt
Now whenever I'm told I won't or I can't
I will, yeah
