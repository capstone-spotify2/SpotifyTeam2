<i>[Verse 1]</i>
I used to be on the corner all day tryin figure out wats gona get me out there
Dope dealing and huggin the block i done found out it aint gonna get me nowhere
Used to keep a 9 mili for protection 
Just incase a nigga wanna to take my brain
Then the voice came down from the sky and said
Akon use your head
I had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what  got me this far 
I had to keep a strong faith and believe in one day i would be a star (a star)
But i knew that it wouldnt come easy (come easy)
But theres been a lotta hatin believe me (believe me)
Dispite all the bullshit we had to still work hard (to get to where we are)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When you hear them calling out Akon let them
Keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out P Money let them
Keep on Calling
Cuz we went through hell and back to get here so
Keep On Calling
Lemme hear you know lemme hear you know just
Keep on calling

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Senegal, West Africa to New Zealand (new zealand)
Bless to have to give make music with meaning (with meaning)
Cuz i never thought i'd come this far (oh yeah)
Witta mansion and a fancy car (ooh yeah)
Never thought success would come this quick in the beginning (but i seen it)
And all along im sittin there thinkin its harder when you came from the hood (you came from the hood)
But all i had to do was put my mind to it and realize it was all good (it was all good)
Once i got rid of what held me down best believe i wouldnt be turnin back (turnin back)
I had to keep to keep on movin and a keep on groovin right here on this P Money track and so
