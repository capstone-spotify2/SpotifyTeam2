Hey la, um de hey oh la
Said, hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Said hey, oh hey, feelin' good today
One day as I was a havin' myself a party
You know a flyin' saucer landed right by my side
You know a big green man jumped out and boy you know he robbed me
You know he beat me for my bottle before I got high

I hittim' up knowing that I was dead
'Cause he had that big ray-gun pointed at my head
But curiosity will get the best of the best
You know he smelled that bottle and the liquor did the rest

And I said, hey la, um de hey oh la
Hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey, oh hey, it ain't over yet

Turned that bottle up and started drinking
It was a long, long time before he pulled it away
His eyes got crossed and man his knees started wobblin'
He took four steps forward and this is what he said

He said, hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
He said hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh la, feel good today

I could see this cat was a just about to party
'Cause he had that great big green in his eye
He said come on hurry on down, let's forget our troubles
Just jump in my space hot-rod and take a little ride

So now I'm not afraid of no kind of space man
'Cause I keep my defenses by my side
And if you ever see me any place or any time
You can bet I'm a holding my bottle by my side

And I'm gonna sing hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh hey, I feel good today
