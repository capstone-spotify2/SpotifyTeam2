One day you fell
Down from the sky
You oversaw things
Forgot how to fly
You're an angry bird
Walking in circles all alone
Angry bird
Now you don't belong
You stagger round
Don't like the air
Don't like the ground
Angry bird
Walking in circles all alone
Angry bird
Radical penguins
Led you astray
You say that wings
Are so passe
You're an angry bird
Walking in circles
No way out
Angry bird
Now you say it's pointless
You say you're cursed
You fill the night with
Sarcastic chirps
You're an angry bird
Walking in circles
No way out
Angry bird
You're fallen in
With the avian fringe
That fill your head with
Thoughts of revenge
You're a bird
In the moanly
Pretty lonely
Angry bird
On the moonlight branches
On a summer's night
You can take your chances
You could take flight
Angry bird
Walking in circles
No way out
Angry bird
Your sun is sinking
It's so absurd
What were you thinking
Angry bird
