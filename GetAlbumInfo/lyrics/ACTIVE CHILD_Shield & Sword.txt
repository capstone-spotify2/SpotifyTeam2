Climb down from your window
Tonight we lie as one
No sleep till tomorrow
The blinds will hide us from the sun
Oh, below... the sheets we meet
Ooh, nobody knows where we'll be
Shield your sword from all of those unknown
Protect as if you're in a fire amongst the flames as they whip... and try to burn you
I'll let you know, that i know, that you're in a fire
I'll let you know, that i know, that you're in a fire
