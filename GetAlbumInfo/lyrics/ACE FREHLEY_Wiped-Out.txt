Wiped Out!

I went to a party, just so smartly, cool as cool could be
I knew I could make it, knew I could shake it, loose and fancy free
So I went to the table and reached for a bottle
And poured me a glass of wine 
Took a few sips and looked around, I was feelin' fine
But an hour along, comin' on strong, I was gettin' drunk
The next thing I knew I looked at you, I was blind as a skunk

(Oh, oh, oh)
I was...

I was wiped out
I had my lights out 
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out

Through the smoke-filled room I caught your eye 
And I think that you caught mine 
And I knew in a minute or maybe less, it was just a matter of time
Then you started to move with such a groove, stronger than sneakin' slow 
Then you looked at me with your big blue eyes, they had such a glow 
So I took your hand and tried to stand and ended up sittin' back down 
Then you smiled at me and gave me a wink, how quick I lost my frown

(Oh, oh, oh)
I was...

I was wiped out
I had my lights out 
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out

So I looked at you and then I knew that we were gonna have some fun 
So I thought to myself, wine was out, we should switch to rum
So without a word and like some bird, we flew to another place 
And pretty soon we were in some room stretched miles out in space
The room was turnin', we were burnin', things became a haze
It seemed that already I had too many, firewater caused the blaze

(Oh, oh, oh)
I was...

I was wiped out
I had my lights out 
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out

I was wiped out
Was fallin' right out
I had my lights out 
'Cause I was wiped out

I was wiped out
I had my lights out 
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out

I was wiped out
Was fallin' right out
I had my lights out 
'Cause I was wiped out

I was wiped out
