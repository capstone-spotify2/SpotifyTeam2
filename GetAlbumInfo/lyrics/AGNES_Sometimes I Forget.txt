I get so busty and I shut you out
And You don't have a clue what that's about
You're probably thinking that I'm getting mad at you
I should take the time to just explain
That you're the only thing that keeps me sane
Cause that would really be the kindest thing to do
Even though there's no one who is closer to my heart
I can see that I have kept you in the dark

Sometimes I forget
Sometimes I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I mean
But There is not a day
That ever passes by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know

I wouldn't blame you if you turned away
But I'd be begging you to stop and stay
You're more important to me than I ever show
So if you're thinking I don't care as much
That I don't appreciate your love
Well I'd be devastated if you let me go
Oh I hate to think I didn't give you the attention you deserved
So I'm hoping now that you believe these words

Sometimes I forget
Sometimes I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I mean
But There is not a day
That ever passes by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know

I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to feel what I feel for you
I just wanted you to know

Sometimes I forget
Sometimes I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I mean
But There is not a day
That ever passes by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know
