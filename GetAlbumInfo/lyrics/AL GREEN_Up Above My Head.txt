Up above my head
I hear music in the air
Up above my head
I hear singing somewhere

I do believe, I do believe, I do believe, I do
There's a Heaven somewhere
I do believe, I do believe, I do believe
There's a Heaven somewhere

Got to say, up above my head
Hear somebody, up above
Up above, up above my head
I hear singing in the air, yeah

Give me a place to stay, I'll rule the earth
Yes, I will, oh yes, I will, oh, yeah
Give me a lovin' hand, baby, yeah
I'll take you by the hand and show you love is worth

Up above, up above

I do believe, I do believe, I do believe
There's gotta be heaven somewhere
I believe, I got to believe, baby
And there's heaven somewhere

Up above, up above
Up above, up above

Baby, up above my head, oh, have mercy
Up above my, baby, baby, baby
You know, up above my head
Baby, baby, baby, up above
