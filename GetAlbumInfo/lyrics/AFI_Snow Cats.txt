Am I coy enough? Not boy enough?
You wanted me in this dress
Or nothing else you say I am
I am not scared enough, prepared enough
You wanted me in distress?
I've nothing left to fear
I am, I am here

I'll wait for you another night
(As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night
(Dressed as you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white

Am I loud too much and proud too much?
You wanted me in this stance
Or on my back you said I am
I am not read enough in bed enough
I've given up on romance
I've nothing left for love
I am, I am here

I'll wait for you another night
(As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night
(Dressed as you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white

Who's to say when the cats are away
What they say, what they say
We won't come back
Who's to say when the cats are away
We won't come back
What they say, what they say
We won't come back
Who's to say when we cats are away
We won't come back
What we say, what I say
I won't stay

I'll wait for you some other night
(Dressed as you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night
(As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you

I'll wait for you
(As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
