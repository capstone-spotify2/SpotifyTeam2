Iâm in over my head, I donât think of you
And bits and pieces, I think of you only like a miracle
Lovin' so deeply, I feel it through all my past lives
It feels good, I'm never saying goodbye
It feels good, I'm never saying goodbye

I'm in over my head, over my head
I'm in over my head, over my head

Silence, they explain it to me
There's no joy I can take with no one worth waiting
Here for now, but not for long
Whether my mind slipped away, explain that to me

I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head

Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
