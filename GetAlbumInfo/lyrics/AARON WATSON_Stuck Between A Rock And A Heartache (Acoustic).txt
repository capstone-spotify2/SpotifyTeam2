He calls from a hotel in downtown Dallas
Says he won't be home for three more days
She gets so lonely in her Houston hill top palace
Talking to her self as their two-year-old plays
She rocks the baby to sleep then gets in bed
Reads romance novels of a love she once had 
She closes her eyes and dreams about the man
Who gave her more than money and a call now and then 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
As the shine on her diamond starts to fade
She recalls the promises they made
But a bond can only bend so far before it breaks
She's stuck between a rock and a heartache

She tries to keep busy with her everyday routines
Soap operas in the afternoons, after she cleans 
As she wipes off a picture frame from their wedding day 
She wonders if he asked her again what would she say 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

She feels like she's stranded somewhere in no man's land
Cause her life is like a prisoner's chained to a wedding band 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
