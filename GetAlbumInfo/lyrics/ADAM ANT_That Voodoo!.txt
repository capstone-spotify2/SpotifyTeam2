That voodoo that you do
the shimmy lights through you
and no one can voodoo the voodoo
you do
do to me yeah

I'm sorry if I'm not that tough
but not that tough is tough enough
besides, the rough tough end up snuffed
or in an alleyway
anyway

I'm sorry if I'm not that smart
but not that smart is just a part
of speaking firmly from the heart
any day
anyway

That voodoo that you do
the shimmy lights through you
and no one can voodoo the voodoo
you do
do to me yeah

That voodoo that you do
the shimmy lights through you
and no one can voodoo the voodoo
you do
do to me yeah

a thrill a day keeps the chill away
love like a dagger and a sound like a wymowhey
a thrill a day keeps the chill away (that)
love like a dagger and a sound like a wymowhey (voodoo!)
