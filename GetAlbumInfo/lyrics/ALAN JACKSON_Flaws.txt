Flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no ten's
All them flaws
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got flaws

The woman that I love, she's purer than dove
I know her best than anyone I guess
The thing I like the most, the wrinkle on her nose
And all the little parts that are unique

All her flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no ten's
All them flaws
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got flaws

Yeah, I look at my two eyes
Left higher than the right
I guess that's just the way I'm supposed to be
I snore when I'm asleep, got long and lengthy feet
The pieces of the puzzle that I am

All my flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no ten's
All them flaws
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got them flaws

Should never be ashamed, embarrassed or afraid
Cause everyone has something they don't like
Remember we're all made with water, dirt and grace
We're all perfect in the eyes that see

All our flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no ten's
All them flaws
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got them flaws

We all got flaws
We all got flaws
Everybody's got a few flaws
Nobody's perfect.
