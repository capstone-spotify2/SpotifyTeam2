Victim of anger tied to distance.
Where does it come from?
Distrust I've stood strong held my head high through constant war.
So brutal so violent.
So I tiptoe through conversation a lapse in my step is misperceived
Unleash a breath of salvation in dormancy lies everlasting rage.
Remember all the fires we started our aspirations for progression.
we feed the burning for a better day don't let your selfishness extinguish the flame.
Prevailing with lasting intentions.
Never living behind your back.
Convictions leave me questioning if you've been living behind mine.
