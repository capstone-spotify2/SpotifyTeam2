I've got the same bad dream every night
My love is gone - out of sight
My brain is mad, my mind is sad
I gotta tell ya, it's that alright
Boring time - time without you

Baby come back, come back to me
I beg you girl, down on my knees
Show me the way, show me the way
I need you so, come back - come back - come back to me

Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life
Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life

Baby I know I'm just a fool
What can I do, I need you so
I wanna give you all my love
I need to have you all night - all night - all night long

Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life
Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life
Come back, baby - come back, baby

Come back, baby come back
I beg you girl, down on my knees
Show me the way, show me the way
I need you so, come back - come back - come back to me

Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life
Do it - do it - do it tonight
You are the girl of my life
