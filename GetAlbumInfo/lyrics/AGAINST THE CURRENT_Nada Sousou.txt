As I leaf through the photos and memories
I can't help but to whisper a "Thank You"
Time after time you are still in my heart
How can you always keep me strong

Come rainy days or perfect sunny ones
You are the one I'm thinking of
Fading away I'll always look for you
Remembering the little things
On a day like this
Tears fall down

Saying a prayer to the brightest star
So many times its become a ritual
Looking up at the evening sky
I will search for you with all my heart

Through lonely nights and the joyous times
Your smile is what I'm thinking of
And if from where you are you see me too
I will believe that maybe you and me will finally meet again

Come rainy days or perfect sunny ones
You are the one I'm thinking of
Fading away I'll always look for you
Remembering the little things
On a day like this
Tears fall down

Still missing you
Still missing you
Joy is thinking of you
Tears fall down
