But they come true, when I'm near you

You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise, and

To shine on you so I'll know where you are
All the rainbows in your favorite shades
To show I love you, thinking of you

Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try

And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
