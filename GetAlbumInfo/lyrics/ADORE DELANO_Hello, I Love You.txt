<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Hey, it's Adore again
Why aren't you answering my calls?
I called like 5 times!
I left you like 7 messages
Call me back

I like the outfit you got yesterday at 12:23
And my favourite thing to do is watch you dream in your sleep
Hello, I'm so happy that you're mine
(Hello, hello)
And I think you blocked my number, so I got a new phone
Cause I'll always be there even when you think you're alone
Hello, never gonna say goodbye
(Hello, hello)

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
Always be together
Always and forever

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I won't leave, until you answer me
What do you say?
(Hello, hello)
(Hello, hello)
I love you
You're all mine, until the end of time
What do you say?
(Hello, hello)
(Hello, hello)
I love you

Got our song, it's up and ready for our very first kiss
And I brought a list of names when we're ready for kids
Hello, I'm so happy that you're mine
(Hello, hello)
Kept a locket of your hair for my collection of you
When you say I'm fucking crazy, I know you mean I'm cute
Hello, never gonna say goodbye
(Hello, hello)

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Hey, it's Adore again
I've called like 10 times
I even called your house phone and left a message with your mother
I haven't heard from you yet
I really miss you!
I like what you were wearing last night...
Call me back please
I love you!

<i>[Chorus]</i>
