Hey man, you're crazy - you're looking so bad
Your body looks perfect - your face like a rat
You are a loser - only shit in your head
You are a fighter - a devil in bed

Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - drive on with me
Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - that's all

Driving the speedway like a superstar
The wheels are turning - you are the sham in your car
The engine is burning - it seems to explode
You know you're winner - the king of the road

Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - drive on with me
Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - that's all

Blood on the speedway and blood in your face
The engine is broken - the end of the race
Your life was dead long - the edge of the knife
You thought you're the winner - and you're never arrived

Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - drive on with me
Helldriver - come to me
Stay with me - that's all
