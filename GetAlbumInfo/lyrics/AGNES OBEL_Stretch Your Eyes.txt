The darkness and the ghost
They dance so sweet and slow
Dug-out from below there
To damn the gods

A grip that will hold
So tight and close
Around my throat with
The weight of all our lives

You can give to my heart
Thousand words or more
You can give to my heart
Thousand words or more

The drum you stroke
Damn that beat so old
In the ground it grows there
To damn the sun (oh what will come to life)

Gates of gold
In your head you hold
A kingdom molten
May the gods be on your side

You can give to my heart
Thousand words or more
You can give to my heart
Thousand words or more
