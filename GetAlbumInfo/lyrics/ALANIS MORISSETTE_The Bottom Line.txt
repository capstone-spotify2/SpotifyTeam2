If somebody asked you to surrender
and that was the only way to win
if somebody offered you the freedom to open your mind again
would you take that flight
would you walk right in

so meet me down at the bottom line
and open my heart with your hands
and we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
and find where the truth has been
down at the bottom line

if somebody led you to the water
if somebody taught you (right?) how to swim
if somebody took your doubt and turned it out
and then you could breathe again
would you take that chance
would you dive right in

so meet me down at the bottom line
and open my heart with your hands
and we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
and find where the truth has been
down at the bottom line

what if the wind blows
the cradle will fall
what if the wise man knows nothing at all
we justify
we crucify
but we don't have the balls to cry

so meet me down at the bottom line
and open my heart with your hands
and we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
and find where the truth has been
down at the bottom line

where truth always flows
that's where we'll go
