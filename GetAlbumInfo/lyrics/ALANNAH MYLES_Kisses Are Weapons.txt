Outside someone is cryin'
Ever since the world began
Someone's cheatin', someone's lyin'
Finally I understand

Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart
Kisses are weapons, ah, weapons of the heart

Outside someone is cryin'
Thought he had a heart of stone
And I'm out here in the dark
And I'm sighin' and you're out there all alone

Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna take me in your arms tonight?
Do you wanna make love to me or do you wanna fight?

There are voices far beyond us
Their secret's ours to share
I can hear them lyin'
Broken on a battlefield

Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart

Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna take me in your arms?
Do you wanna make love to me or do you wanna fight?
Oh yeah, do you wanna fight?

Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart

Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna fight or make love to me?
