Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
Never had a chance to say goodbye

I met her back in sixty-three, she was such a mystery
She was there on barron street, down in new orleans
So wild, but yet so tame, she could calm a hurricane
She was only seventeen and Amelia was her name

Oh when I took her for a ride, she got close by my side
And when I looked into her eye, Amelia kept me hypnotized
But in my heart she fell, oh I got pulled into her spell
I can still see her there, with the flowers in her hair

Oh Amelia, my southern woman, oh my woman
I can still feel you, feel you, feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
Never heard her say goodbye

I remember making love underneath the stars above
I can feel the summer breeze up in magnolia trees
That night in the southern light, the girl she took me by the hand
I was weak as a little lamb, but I became a man

Love was pumping through my veins, her lips were sweet like sugarcane
We rode all night in the rain, 'cross lake poncetrain
She had a heart as fine as fire, burning innocent desire
I can still see her there, with flowers in her hair

Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to, where'd you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
Never want to say goodbye

Just like a shooting star, she vanished in the night
But I'll always remember her lips so warm and tender
And in my heart she'll always shine so bright
Sweet Amelia, if I could just see her one more time

Oh Amelia, my southern woman
A southern woman,
I can still feel you, oh I can feel you, everytime I close my eyes, close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye (never, never, never, never never say goodbye)

Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye

Oh Amelia, a southern woman,
A southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes, from the bottom of my heart
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia,
Where did you run to
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
