Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
I'd really ever take it this far
Singin' in the bars

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
And chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream

An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord,
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Now daddy's got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said; son I just know
We're gonna hear you singin' on it some day
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
