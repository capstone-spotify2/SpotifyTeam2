I see you every damn day and I can't help wondering why
Why you look so good, but I ain't ever seen you smile
Got a man that's find you, everything in this world
But I guess he ain't loving you right girl, no

'Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, your one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know,
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I want if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder

What he doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

What he doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So blue, so blue

With a body like that girl you being his ain't fair
See I will love you up down an all around town I swear
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life, oh

'Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, your one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know,
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I want if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder

What he doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

What he doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So blue, so blue

See blue ain't your color
Baby you need a lover
That knows what you like,
Comes through every time,
He ain't ever gonna let you shine
I'm that solution, 'cause your man is a loser
Who's making you feel so blue, so blue, so blue

'Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, your one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know,
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I want if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder

What he's doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

What he doing with a girl like you?
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So blue, so blue

Too fine to be looking so blue
Too fine to be looking so blue
How he ended up with a girl like you?
You're fine to be looking so blue
