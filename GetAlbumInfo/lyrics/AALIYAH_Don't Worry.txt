Thereâs no need for you,
Baby,
It ainât what you think,
So donât worry,

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
You remember back in the day when,
We thought it was special,
When we always stayed down,
No matter where we went youâd stay in touch,
Two people that were just so in love,
Now you claiming that you feelinâ like things
Ainât really been the way they used to be,
And you say it seems like I changed,
But Iâm still the same.

<i>[Chorus (2X)]</i>
Thereâs no need for you,
(To worry âbout me)
Baby,
(Donât worry âbout me)
It ainât what you think,
(You still got me)
So donât worry,
(Donât worry âbout, donât worry âbout me)
Even though it seems,
(Youâre losing me)
And things,
(Ainât what they used to be)
Baby,
(I ainât gonna leave)
Donât worry,
(Donât worry âbout, donât worry âbout me)

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
I was headinâ out to Cali,
For a show,
I told you that on Tuesday,
Iâd be home,
Left a message on your voicemail
Sayinâ Iâd call you later,
To inform you Iâm alright,
Now you callinâ,
Just to tell me that you heard,
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls,
So Iâm on my way to a spot where people hang,
But nothingâs changed.

<i>[Chorus (2X)]</i>

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Thereâs no need to
Worry âbout what
I do when Iâm away.

(Donât worry âbout a damn thing)
Donât worry âbout what I do when I'm outta town,
(Donât worry âbout a damn thing)
Donât worry âbout how I do when I put it down,
(Donât worry âbout a damn thing)
Trust in my everythingâs gonna be alright,
Gonna work it out, be home tonight.

<i>[Chorus (2X)]</i>
