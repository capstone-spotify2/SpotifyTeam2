She said it's painful
But that feeling will pass
He said he can't go on
That it was just meant
To last, to last, to last, to last
How did time go so fast?

His head is aching
Can't find the words to say
His hands are shaking up
Now there's no reason
To stay, to stay, to stay, to stay
She said it's better this way

And he can hear her
Say it's over

Now they're breaking up
And he's broken down
With his heart lying bleeding
Six feet underground
Well he loved her once
But he'll never again
Cause now, now
They're just best friends

A missing factor
In their equation of lust
Some other player has
Turned this love now
To rust, to rust, to rust, to rust
Jealousy's killed his trust
It's killed his trust

And he can hear her
Say it's over

Now they're breaking up
And he's broken down
With his heart lying bleeding
Six feet underground
Well he loved her once
But he'll never again
Cause now, now
They're just best friends

It's so complicated
Love's so overrated
She'll never understand
That this boy will soon be a man

Now they're breaking up
And he's broken down
With his heart lying bleeding
Six feet underground
Well he loved her once
But he'll never again
Yeah he loved her once
But he'll never again
Cause now, now
They're just best friends
Yeah now, right now, their just best friends

And he can hear her
Say it's over
