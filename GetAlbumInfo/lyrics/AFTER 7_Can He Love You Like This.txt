You give him all your love, well
you know you don't get that love in return
How could I get you to know
And though you seen it comin'
Girl you just couldn't get that man to ever learn
So this time I hope you move on
Cause you know, I'm what your missin
And you know that I'm good and its good that you need
So please tell me baby

Can he love you like this
can he give the good lovin you need
top it off with a kiss
Can he make you go all night long

I know it might seem dirty
But I'll do what I gotta do just to make you mine
and it was always a matter of time
You see I know that you want me
Cause I can tell by the way that you squeeze
You can't get that kinda lovin at home
I'll be strokin you, rockin you, turnin you on
And girl you know, that I'm what your missin'
and you know that I'm good and its good that you need
So please tell me baby, baby, baby

Can he love you like this
can he give the good lovin you need
top it off with a kiss
Can he make you go all night long <i>[x2]</i>

Oh cause you know, that I'm what your missin
And you know that I'm good
So please tell me baby noooo

Can he love you like this
can he give the good lovin you need
top it off with a kiss
Can he make you go all night long <i>[x2]</i>

Can he love you, baby can he love ya
Can he love you , baby can he love ya
Can he give you everything that you been missin
give you the love that you know that you need
