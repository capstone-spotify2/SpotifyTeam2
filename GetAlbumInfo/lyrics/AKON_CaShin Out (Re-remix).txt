Grab the top, hop in, hoes they come in 'bout flypers in
Birds they come in 'bout 5 percent
Pass them birds like stock den

Ain't don't act like you who ain't choosed

Ride 'round blowin' them stank bombs
Push so good you stank moms
Top flow suture the neck upon
You want a whole lovely yard of crumbs
