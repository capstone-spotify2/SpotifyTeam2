There are those who fly
From the highest heights
On the wings they carry-
Searching for the high
They can never find-
Thinking love is blind.
Never mind.
They'll never see
The forest for the trees
'Til they turn to love.

Crying through the eyes
Of my own disguise-
Came to know the truth
From the lies.
So,I hope you'll understand how
I'm another kind of man now.
All I want is just to stand
Closer to your love.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna feel the fire,power,
And all I can dream of.
Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna move in
closer to your love.

If you try to fly
From the highest heights
On the wings you carry-
Searching for the high
Of your own design,
You may come to find
You been blind.

So I hope you'll understand how
I'm another kind of man now.
All I want is just to stand
A little closer to your love.

<i>[Repeat chorus 5 times.]</i>
