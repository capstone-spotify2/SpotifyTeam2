I see you walking
And I take my time to know
I feel you breathing
But I just can't let it go

My time is wasting
But I know I cannot heal
You said it was nothing
But I know that shit was real

No, I couldn't keep you from moving along that day
No, I couldn't keep you from running along
I think that I'll go now
You don't even care

I hate how it drives me so crazy
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me
I hate that it turned 'cause I made it
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me

Doo-doo-doo-doo-noo
Knowing you are the one and you're not thinking 'bout me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-noo
Knowing you are the one and you're not thinking 'bout me

I see you leaving
And you're probably heading home
I know you're with him
And I just can't let that go

'Cause she didn't come with any leeway
Yeah I know, I'm not alright
One thing that i missed was goodbye

No, I couldn't keep you from moving along that day
No, I couldn't keep you from running along
I think that I'll go now
You don't even care

I hate how it drives me so crazy
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me
I hate that it turned 'cause I made it
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me

Doo-doo-doo-doo-noo
Knowing you are the one and you're not thinking 'bout me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-noo
Knowing you are the one and you're not thinking 'bout me

She says she was a friend till end of days
and thats the day she left
And I know I'm just a stranger, living a look for love
She says she was a friend that left

So why would you look back
Cause maybe I know that there's no reason
So why would you stay

I hate how it drives me so crazy
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me
I hate that it turned 'cause I made it
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me

I hate how it drives me so crazy (Noo)
Knowing you are the one, and you're not thinking 'bout me
I hate that it turned 'cause I made it (Noo) (ooooo)
