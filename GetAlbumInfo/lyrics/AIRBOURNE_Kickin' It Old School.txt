I don't need to cut my hair 
Don't need a job when ya livin' on welfare 
I got a girl who thinks sex is a thrill 
Don't need protection cause she's on the pill 

You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 

I'm free balling in the hot summer heat 
Skinny dippin' in the public beach 
I got green leaf growing in my backyard 
And homebrew stinkin' up the garage 

You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 

Kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 

I'm in a band that plays rock'n'roll 
We sing, songs about, rock'n'roll 

You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 
You know I'm kickin' it old school 

You know I'm kickin' it old school 
Kickin' it old school 
Kickin' it old school 
Kickin' it old school
