They say, that all good things must end 
still it hasn't sunk in yet 
I'll never hear your voice again 
I suppose, I took you for granted all these years 
That you would always be right here 
My heart was crushed the day you left 
funny how life can change so fast 
Now that you're gone, there's something I don't understand 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
What do I do with all this love 
since you left me, feels like starting over 
Won't somebody let me know 
What do I do with all this love 
I still carry inside me 
If you can hear me now/ if you can tell me now 
(If you're in heaven now/ if you can hear me now) 
What do I do with all this love 

Who do I sing, sing my songs for now 
now that you don't come around 
You were so hard to impress 
Feels so strange, how everything I say and do 
always somehow leads me back to you 
You were my burdon and my gift 
funny it's feel you're listening 
Answer me this, and I'll never ask again 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

(Oh, somebody tell me) 

Skin to skin and dust to dust 
as long as I'm breathing, I'll be missing you this much 

<i>[Chorus (2x impro/variation)]</i>
