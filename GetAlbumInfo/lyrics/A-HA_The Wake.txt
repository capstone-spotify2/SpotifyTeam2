Can't change the one you are
Can't change the one you love
Lower your guard
I've made a few mistakes
I'll tell you what it takes
Under the stars

Have you seen the other me at times?
Walking on an ever looser line

Baby this is a wake
You and I will not escape
As time goes by

The world's never been older
Your head on my shoulder
So close your eyes

Stung by normality
Wronged by your family
Conventions aside

Cannot change the one you love
From inside â or from above
Just hold him tight

Walking on an ever looser line
But love has let me over every time

Baby we're on a wake
You and I will not escape
Just close your eyes

The world's never been older
Your head on my shoulder
As time goes by

Baby this is a wake
None of us will escape
Who we are

The world's never been older
Your head on my shoulder
As time goes by
