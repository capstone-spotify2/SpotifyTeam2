Somethings got a hold on me
I can't escape this feeling
You took a special part of me
You take but you don't care
'Cause you think that a heart never mends
So you run from me time and again
Don't go saying you love me
As you turn and push me away

Surrender your heart to me
'Cause I will love you forever
Surrender your love
Oh, surrender
To my love

You say that you've been burned before
That's why you hesitated
But I can't take this anymore
You just can't keep me waiting
Forever...it's too long a time
When your putting your heart on the line
Come and tell me you love me
In time maybe you'll pass it away

Yeah! Surrender your heart to me
'Cause I will love you forever
Surrender your love
Oh, surrender
Surrender your heart to me
'Cause love was meant to be given
Surrender your love
Oh, surrender
To my love

'Cause I'll never leave you
Broken hearted, hurt or sad
Whenever you're near to me
Be the best thing
That I've ever had

Somethings got a hold on me
A special kind of feeling
So don't you walk away from me, oh no

Surrender your heart
Oh, surrender
Surrender your love
Oh, surrender
Surrender your heart to me
'Cause love was meant to be given
Surrender your love
Oh, surrender
To my love
To your love
To my love
