There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea.
You became the light on the dark side of me.
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill.
But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah.
And now that your rose is in bloom.
A light hits the gloom on the gray.

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say.
You remain, my power, my pleasure, my pain, 
Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny.
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?
But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom.
A light hits the gloom on the gray.

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
...And if I should fall along the way
I've been kissed by a rose
...been kissed by a rose on the gray.

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say.
You remain, my power, my pleasure, my pain.

To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby.
But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray.
