I don't need no sign, don't need no map
Baby, I know right where I'm at with you
I never thought there'd be a time
But when I felt your hand in mine, I knew
So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you

I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there

I must admit I'm new at this
But you've got something I can't resist somehow
Like a horseshoe magnet and a paper clip
Baby, I'm drawn right to your lips right now
So if you're thinking I could walk away
Baby, I'm afraid it's a little late
I've already crossed the promise line

I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there

So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you

I, I will be there
I, I will be there, I swear
