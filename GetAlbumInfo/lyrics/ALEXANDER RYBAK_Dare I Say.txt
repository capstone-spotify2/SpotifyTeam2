Far from the place
Where I'm writing this song
There is a girl
To whom my heart belongs
She doesn't know
That I'm thinking of her
But again
That's not the point

She makes me glad
Just by being alright
Though I would wish
That just for one night
She would come back
And again we'd be friends
Like those times
When love never ends

Watching your picture
I feel I'm with you
And your hand is flirting with mine
Maybe it's pointless
But what can I do?
Knowing you're one of a kind

Honestly
I know I'll be fine

But dare I say
You are amazing in every way
And would you mind
If we woke up with each other each day?

But then I remember that I'm just a guy
And still I keep dreaming of you
Cause that's all I can do

You said you loved him
The last time we met
Please tell your boyfriend
That I'm not a threat
I know the difference
Between right and wrong
But again
That's not the point

Sometimes I sleep
With a smile on my face
Cause dreaming of you
Makes me glad
And then I wake up
While I'm still in my dream
The sweet kiss
That we never had

Honestly,
How foolish is that?

But dare I say
You are amazing in every way
And would you mind
If we woke up with each other each day?

But then I remember that I'm just a guy
And still I keep dreaming of you
Cause that's all I can do

(Dare I say?
Ooh
Would you mind?)

But dare I say
You are amazing in every way
And would you mind
If we woke up with each other each day?

But then I remember that I'm just a guy
