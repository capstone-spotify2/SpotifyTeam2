Listen!
Pick me up
Fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said itâs party time
When Iâm on the loose
Make it feel alright
Listen, drinks all around
Iâm in the mood
Because the night is mine

Letâs play ball
Shoot it down the wall 
Letâs play ball, baby
Battinâ down the stalls
Play, play, play ball

Listen Sid, light me up
Iâm in love
Iâm all regional now
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud

Letâs play ball
Shoot it down the wall, yeah
Letâs play ball
Battinâ down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball

Letâs play ball
Shootin' down the wall
Letâs play ball
And never stall
Letâs play ball
Letâs play ball
Letâs play ball
Play, play, play ball
