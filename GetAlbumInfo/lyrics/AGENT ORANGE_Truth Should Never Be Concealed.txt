i feel alright - that's what it's all about
the truth is going to blow your mind without a doubt
let me tell you a tale - a story so bizarre
and yet it's true - they pulled the plug
but it's not over yet
i've still got my guitar
no time to waste - no secrets to reveal
no lie `cuz this is it
i'm telling you exactly how i feel

the truth should never be concealed
nothing stops the spinning wheel

i'm freaking out - i know it sounds absurd
but i've got to put my life out on the line
with every word
i'm at the top - i'm eighteen stories high
i'm on the edge - but i'm not gonna to fall
you know i've got to live before i die
i'm breaking out - through walls of solid steel
i'm only gonna say it once
so listen close - now here's the deal

the truth should never be concealed
this is live and this is real
