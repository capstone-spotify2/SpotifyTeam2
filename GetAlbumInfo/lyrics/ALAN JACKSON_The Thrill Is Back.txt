We'll I'm ready to raise the blinds in this place
Think I'll rejoin the human race
You said yes now your wearing my ring
Guess I can stop playing ol B.B.King

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Cause the thrill is back
the heartache's gone
Time stands still baby love lives on
the room spins around when your kissing me
the thrill is back like it used to be

I sure could use a hair cut and shave
Now that I'm crawling outta my cave
Since you've said we were through
I've been down with a case of the blues

Cause the thrill is back
the heartache's gone
Time stands still baby love lives on
the room spins around when your kissing me
the thrill is back like it used to be

<i>[Bridge]</i>
I think I'd better give my doctor a call
And tell him i won't need that prozac after all

Cause the thrill is back
the heartache's gone
Time stands still baby love lives on
the room spins around when your kissing me
the thrill is back like it used to be

Cause the thrill is back
the heartache's gone
Time stands still baby love lives on
the room spins around when your kissing me
the thrill is back like it used to be

<i>[Tag]</i>
The room spins around when your kissing me
the thrill is back like it used to be
