The pictures on the wall look at all to come
Judging right from wrong has the prodigal sun
Be careful giving what you've done
To all of us, and everyone
And when you look inside yourself
I hope you find someone else

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We are the fear
We are the gossip in your ears
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on
We are the faith
We are the noise patrol saints
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on

Pictures lost their voice due to circumstance
Searching for a choice set in deep romance
Fooled myself for way too long
But now I'm ready to move on
Sacrifice yourself, or face the fear of someone else

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We are the fear
We are the gossip in your ears
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on
We are the faith
We are the noise patrol saints
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on

We are the fear
(We are the fear)
We are the gossip in your ears
(We are the gossip in your ears)
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on

We are the faith
We are the noise patrol saints
And you, My Dear, have played the fool for far too long
Just move on
Just move on

We are the fear
We are the gossip
