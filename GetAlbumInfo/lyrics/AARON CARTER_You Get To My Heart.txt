When I need someone to believe in
I turn to you
And you never ever let me down
You always come through
And I just wanna thank you for
The way you make me make feel, heyyy

Baby you get to my heart
The deepest part
Girl I wanna be where ever you are
Only you know
Right where to go
Something that I never had
Is taking control, it's your love
From the start
You get to my heart

If in time
You don't know where to run to
Just come to me
I'll be here for you with all my heart
Be all that you need
Cuz someone like you is
One in a milion, it's true, heyyy

Baby you get to my heart
The deepest part
Girl I wanna be where ever you are
Only you know
Right where to go
Something that I never had
Taking control is your love
From the start
You get to my heart

Can't believe how long I've waited
Without you in my life
All I've ever wanted
I can see in your eyes

Baby you get to my heart
The deepest part
Girl I'm gonna be where ever you are
Only you know
Right where to go
Something that I never had
Is taking control
It's your love
From the start
You get to my heart

Yeah, you get to my heart
