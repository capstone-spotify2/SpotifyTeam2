I've gone so many ways
I've been to all places
But everything seems so sad without you

Your love has flown away
The days are cold and grey
I can't love no one else like I've loved you before, before
Take my hand, I'll take your soul
Oh, don't say you can't love me no more
Girl I need you so much, I feel so lonely - so lonely

Can't believe this shall be the end
But the love letters I have sent
Have gone no answer - how can I go on

Oh - baby
Give me your love - No time to loose
Baby come back run away all my blues
Light up my life, don't waste the time
I know if you are back then you are mine

Your love has flown away
The days are cold and grey
I can't love no one else like I've loved you before, before

Take my hand, I'll take your soul
Oh, don't say you can't love me no more
Girl I need you so much, I feel so lonely - so lonely

Give me your love - no time to loose
Baby come back drive away all my blues
Light up my life - don't waste the time
I know if you are back then you are mine
