He was just eighteen
Full of fire and gasoline
He was lean and mean
And they called him Texas

He went off to war
To a far and distant shore
He'd never left his home before
He was from Texas

As they stormed that beach one foggy summer day
He said if I don't make it back promise me one thing

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas

Well she was just eighteen
Prettiest thing he'd ever seen
Like a real life beauty queen
And someday she'd be his wife

But for the next four years
She fought back her tears
While he fought back his fears
Fighting for his life

And in his darkest hours
Her love would bring him a light
He would read her letters
He would pray at night

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas

He always said the real heroes
Never made it back home
And though the war was long over
You know for him it still lived on
And it still lives on

When he was eighty-three
Still full of fire and gasoline
He was still lean and mean
And they still called him Texas

And on the day he died
She was right there by his side
She held his hand as she softly sang his lullaby

Take me home if I die
When I'm gone don't ya cry
Find some shade right beside a live oak tree
Sing those old songs of faith
I'll fly away amazing grace
But you find comfort knowing that my soul found peace
And you can bury me
You can bury me
You can bury me beneath the deep blue skies of Texas
