When all you can do
Is turn back around
Walk over your footprints
To what you've already found
And crawl through the pieces
That you left on the ground

Cause everything is there
But its too close and it's too much
It's not the fear of letting go
But it's the fear of losing love
And that's just how the story goes
As you watch your life unfold
Now what you have is what you had
And now its gone, your on your own

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you
No I won't forget you...

No I never wanted
To Leave things like this
I put up these walls
So you can't see in
But inside I'm dying
I want to let you in

Cause everything is there, but its too close and it's too much
It's not the fear of letting go, but it's the fear of losing love

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you
No I won't forget you...

I won't, I won't forget you
I won't, no I won't forget you
Just slow down, just slow down
Just, slow down, just slow down
Slow down, and hold on...

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you
No I won't forget you...
