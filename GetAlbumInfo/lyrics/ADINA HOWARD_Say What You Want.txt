Now youâve done
Told me all about his past 
Reminding me that it wonât last 
And how I should just move on
Youâre tryinâ to say youâre doinâ me a favor
When in all honesty gesture hater
Cause you donât have no one to love you like I do

You can say what you want 
but I donât believe
one word you said
to make me think
I understand that game of confusion
You give me lead than u choosinâ 

Once Iâm out of the doe
You wonât move ass enough to get you some
Some of that same â¦. you told me to â¦.
But it ainât goinâ that way 
Trayinâ ... another day 
You can say what you want 
I ainât goinâ no way

So in addition to what Iâve said
Youâre never gonna make it to his bâ¦
So give it up and
Get it out of my ear 
Cause I pick game 
When you said
That all man are all the same 

So I told you to leave him 
I told you to leave him
He ainât no good for you
He ainât nothinâ but a doll
And heâs always out with his boys

You canât get me to leave
Or change what I believe
