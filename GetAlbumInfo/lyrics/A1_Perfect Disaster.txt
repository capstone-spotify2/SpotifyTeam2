Some of us were born to break
The slightest knock is all it takes
I'm sleeping while I'm wide awake, woah

I've tried to thicken up my skin
I'm having trouble fitting in
I'd rather sink than never swim, woah

Now all my life I have learned
It's me just me against the world

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster

Everytime I talk I choke
I hide behind the songs I wrote
It's killing me with every note, woah

Will all my fears be confirmed 
Is it me just me against the world

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster

As far as I am concerned
It's now you and me against the world

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster
