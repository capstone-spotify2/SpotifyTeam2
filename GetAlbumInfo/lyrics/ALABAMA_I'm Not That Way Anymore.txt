We used to get crazy every Saturday night
We drive into town and get feeling right
A child of the 60s in '74
But I'm not that way anymore

Well I burned the tires off my Chevrolet
Trying to impress the girls that I date
And I've been a gambler when I couldn't score
But I'm not that way anymore

I'm not that way anymore
Time's closing yesterday's door
I'm just as happy as I was before
'Cause I'm not that way anymore

American Bandstand, The Sullivan Show
I listened to the Opry on my radio
Well Dick Clark's still looking as young as before
But I'm not that way anymore

Well I swapped my loafers for cowboy boots
And bought me some jeans, gave away all my suits
My razor is rusted my barber is bored
'Cause I'm not that way anymore

I'm not that way anymore
Time's closing yesterday's door
I'm just as happy as I was before
'Cause I'm not that way anymore

I'm not that way anymore
Time's closing yesterday's door
I'm just as happy as I was before
'Cause I'm not that way
And you're not that way
We're not that way anymore...
