One word from him is worth ten from me
A student of adversity
He beat indulgence right out of me
That wild eyed child from Tin Pan Alley
Ssshhh...

He wanted to search inside me
To find this oh so, oh so cool purity
He showed me the films I just can't see
The wild eyed child of Tin Pan Alley, yeah

Who's a goofy bunny, who's a goofy bunny then?
Who's a goofy bunny, who's a goofy bunny then?

He showed my the slim chance I'd got
And all the friendships that I had not
Be sure he has the guts of three
The wild eyed child of Tin Pan Alley, yeah

Who's a goofy bunny, who's a goofy bunny then?
