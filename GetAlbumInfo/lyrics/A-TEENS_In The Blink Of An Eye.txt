Hey,
Is there something I can do?
You broke your heart into
Many pieces
Now you gotta put it back again

Now when you're trying to make it through
And you're feeling kinda blue
I'll be there to tell you
That things will change

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
When you turn around
All the tears will dry
Whatever was lost
Will be found
In the blink of an eye
When you're losing ground
Hold your head up high
Whatever was lost
Will be found
In the blink of an eye

Hey I know I should be sinkin deep
I know I ought to weep
Like a baby
But it's really not that bad
Cause when my heart was achin'
When my world was shakin'
You were there to tell me
That things will change

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I thought my heart was on the mend
Now I'm falling for a friend
Someone who was there
When things were changing

In the blink of an eye
Everything changes
In the blink of an eye
What's lost can be found

<i>[Chorus]</i>

When you turn around
All the tears will dry
Whatever was lost will be found
In the blink of an eye
