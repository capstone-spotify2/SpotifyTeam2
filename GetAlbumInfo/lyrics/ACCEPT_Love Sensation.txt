Giddy - up!

It's just her nature
I've had enough of the night
Taken by systems of love

I'm outta money
But gotten ounces of love
She got her name droppin' down to an art

Don't need no mother
Just a woman in kind
A stranger suits me fine

How she's been spreadin' it around - ah!
What admiration
I feel less than respect

I've laid my cards on the table
She's gotta deal with it
No more money to burn
No pages to turn

Wanna be your love sensation
I don't feel no need to wonder why
Let me be your love sensation
I feel your need your heat your need

For free admission
An open world of surprise
Ticket season just for the ride

With a wag of your tail
And the wind in my smile
'cause even every dog has it's day - yes it does

I've laid - I've laid my cards on the table
She's gotta deal with it
No more money to burn
No pages to turn

Let me be your love sensation
I don't feel no need to wonder why
Let me be your sensation - (love sensation)
I feel your heat child

c-c-c-call it what you like

Oooh, gotta be - gotta be your love sensation - (love sensation)
I don't feel no need to wonder why - (I feel the need)
Let me be your love sensation - (love sensation)
I feel your need the heat the need - (I feel the heat)

Let me be your love sensation - (love sensation)
I ain't got no time to wonder why - (no time to wonder why)
Let me be your love sensation - (let me be your love sensation)

I'll eat your heat - (I need your love sensation)
