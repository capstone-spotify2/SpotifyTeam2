We feel so much better here below
Down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
We rot inside out, we crack and flake
Nothing is better than deep down below

My whole mouth brimming of leaves, submerged and gasping for air

Let the earth swallow me whole
Fertile graves bury me engulf my bones
Eyes full of stone as they close
Intertwine with the sediment as we sink into the mire
Oh I sense a confused declaration

We beat the horse with a sort of unknown conviction
And nothing ever matters, we sink into the mire

So I lay here tangled in vines and a mouth brimming with leaves
Theres nothing to eat but she fertilizes me

We feel so much better here below
Down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
We rot inside out, we crack and flake
Nothing is better than deep down below

Do you know what it's like to be inside separate from life
A shallow grave for benevolence
Submerged we grasp for light but none that truly exists
Better then, nothing now, You feel the earth surround you as you fall
Inside a new life animates itself

We feel so much better here below
Down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
We rot inside out, we crack and flake
Nothing is better than deep down below
We feel so much better here below
Down here where the eyes are blank and cold
We rot inside out, we fast decay
Nothing is better than deep down below
