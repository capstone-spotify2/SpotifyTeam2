1, 2, 3, 4 I'm from London

This the start of the end of my life
The questions I have, will only be solved with time

But I won't wait quietly
I have a lot of other things to do
Everybody's growing up around me,
But I ain't got no patience so
Let's have another jack and coke

I'm at a center of a story
But I've still got some time to grow
So crack another Jack and coke

I try to act like a grown up I find
It doesn't sit right
Even though I'm past my prime

Tinkled on the piano,
Not as good as I would like to be

Everybody's growing up around me,
But I ain't got no patience so
Let's have another jack and coke
I'm at a center of a story
But I've still got some time to grow
So crack another Jack and coke

I'm gonna flicker from person to place
Until I can get what I need

I'm gonna flicker from person to place
Until I can get what I need
(Because I'm a wanderer)

I'm gonna flicker from person to place
Until I can get what I need
(Because I'm a wanderer)

I'm gonna flicker from person to place
Until I can get what I need
Because I'm a wanderer
And wanderer I've aways been

Everybody's growing up around me,
But I ain't got no patience so
Let's have another jack and coke
I'm at a center of a story
But I've still got some time to grow
So crack another Jack and coke

(Let's have a jack and coke!)
