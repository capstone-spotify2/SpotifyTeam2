Go away little girl
go away little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
but our lips must never meet
I belong to somebody else
and I must be true.

oh go away little girl
go away little girl
it's hurting more the longer that you delay
when you are near me like this
you're much too hard to resist
go away little girl
before I beg you to stay.

I know that your lips are sweet
but our lips must never meet
I belong to somebody else
and I must be true.

go way little girl
it's hurting me the longer that you delay
when you are near me like this
you're much too hard to resist
go way little girl
before I beg you to stay.
