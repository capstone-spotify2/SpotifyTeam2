Don't have the arms for the deep end,
The walls are <i>[?]</i> around me
I don't have the balls for the down side
I don't take it seriously
We are the champions of endings
I know where that shit's gonna lead (yeah)
Don't have no use for pretending
We're what we wanted to be

And she said
Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

You got the message I'm sending
You wanna be one of them
We are the champions of endings
We'll be together again

And she said
Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

It's not a place to stop
No time for giving up
We're running out today
I'm over it okay
We're never at the top
We're gonna let it rock
We're the champions
We're the champions

We've got the champions of endings...

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay

Are you alone
It's alright
Are you alone
It's okay
