And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days

Like a coin to a packer with a hole
We were like them, nothing less, nothing more
Here's your 50 cent, fine! You can keep it
Cause you are a little late and your pockets is empty
You used to be my wind and I was your dust
I'll follow you everywhere you could thrust
The end of the day comes night
Now I know wrong from right
I remember the night you was walking
Hand in hand with that flimsy girl
And you made sure I'd end up feeling like it's my fault
It took some time to open up my eyes
Now the grass is surely greener on the other side
I'm glad that I can say, I got this fool out my mind

And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days

I need a boy, lookin lookin at my phone
Hopping, praying you could call it
It got too quiet so ended up falling falling falling
Sunken down, sunken down
An di was here to 11, and now you're expecting
For me to come around cause what we had was profound
You don't miss your water until it runs dry
Never like before, you had me wrong with your lies

And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days

To be honest I was a little clueless
Didn't know that you'd end up being so heartless
I was mess when you left
After all the stress babe, they should put you under arrest
Now you're over here thinking you could get it back
Look at you, still thinking you want that
I tell you what... you can kiss my ass
