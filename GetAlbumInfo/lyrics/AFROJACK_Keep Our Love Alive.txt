I hope you understand i'm hanging on to you
Through a colors of love
I will never fade out or stray too far from you
I'll be the face in every moon
Painting a smile along reminding you
Every panic cheat infused
We will survive
But how do we keep our love alive

Why does something so good feel so damn hard tonight
When there's nobody's fault we will tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive
How do we keep our love alive

I know you understand how you surrender me
From the city of ruins
I was built back up when your heart cemented me
I'll be the silence where you sleep
I'll be the violence to you on the streets
You can look up and follow me
Through the dead of the night
But how do we keep our love alive

Why does something so good feel so damn hard tonight
When there's nobody's fault we get tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive
How do we keep our love alive

Why does something so good feel so damn hard tonight
When there's nobody's fault we will tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive
