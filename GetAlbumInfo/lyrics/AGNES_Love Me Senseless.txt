I'm floating higher bring the atmosphere, oh
You're everything but us just disappears, yeah
Never plain like coming down from here
I wanna melt into your arms, into the stars, into the night and fly away

Beyond any world I've ever seen, your eyes take me
Beyond any dream I'll ever dream, your touch wakes me
Baby I just need to read you in, feel my body come alive again
Let me get lost inside your kiss, oh love me senseless

Oh love me senseless
Don't know how I live without your love, oh
I only know I never lived enough I know, oh no
Now I think I almost feel too much
I just wanna let it flow, let it go into the blue and fly with you

Beyond any world I've ever seen, your eyes take me
Beyond any dream I'll ever dream, your touch wakes me
Baby I just need to read you in, feel my body come alive again
Let me get lost inside your kiss, oh love me senseless
Oh love me senseless

Oh love me senseless
Feel my song without a sound (Feel my song without a sound)
Till I know it to be found (Till I know it to be found, ohh)

Beyond any world I've ever seen, your eyes take me
Beyond any dream I'll ever dream, your touch wakes me
Baby I just need to read you in
Feel my body come alive again
Let me get lost inside your kiss, oh love me senseless
