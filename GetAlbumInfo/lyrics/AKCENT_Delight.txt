Wanna feel u
Wanna touch u
Wanna have u
Would u be my light?
In this night
The same bright
I feel right
So right

Love u
Wanna hold u
Wanna kiss u
Would u be my light?
In this night
The same bright
I feel right
So right

I really wanna feel the way Iâm on tonight
I want u by my side to kiss and hold u tight
I wanna stay forever here I really do
Itâs gonna be a crazy night for me and u

We can dream under moonlight
Watching u is a delight

I really wanna feel the way Iâm on tonight
I want u by my side to kiss and hold u tight
I wanna stay forever here I really do
Itâs gonna be a crazy night for me and u

Can stop the time?
This moment is so so blind?
Is that a sign?
I have to make u mine

Letâs stop the time
Ur touch is so so blind
I have to make u mine <i>[x2]</i>

I really wanna feel the way Iâm on tonight
I want u by my side to kiss and hold u tight
I wanna stay forever here I really do
Itâs gonna be a crazy night for me and u
