Well, I sympathize completely,
But there's nothing I can do.
I am just a humble servant
With a message here for you.
Well I know you have good reasons
And there's things you've got to do,
But the boatman won't be waiting
And he's leaving here with you.
And you can't take it with you,
No matter what you do.
No, you can't take it with you,
Not the place you're going to...

(One more mile, one more road, one last bridge, one less load.)

Well I sympathize completely,
But there's nothing I can do.
I am just obeying orders,
I'm a simple soul like you.
Well you really are persuasive,
But I've heard it all before
And the boatman's getting restless
As he stands upon the shore...
And you can't take it with you,
No matter what you do.
No, you can't take it with you,
Not the place you're going to...

Can't take it with you...
Can't take it with you...
Can't take it with you...
Can't take it with you...
