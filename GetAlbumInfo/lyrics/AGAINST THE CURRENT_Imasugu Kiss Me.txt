Waiting on the overpass
I recognized your jacket
I ran as fast as I could go to
you amidst the crowd

I can feel my heart racing
I donât wanna lie

Your words are spinning around
But I wonât say no thank you
Today Iâll tell my usual old
timid self good bye

I can feel my heart racing
I donât wanna lie, oh yeah

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
Perfect in every way, you already know

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
All I know is I love you so

Not worried about all the small things
As long as we can get by
I got my ticket right here
With a map to your heart

I can feel my heart racing
I donât wanna lie, oh yeah

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
Perfect in every way, you already know

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
All I know is I love you so

I can feel my heart racing
I donât wanna lie, oh yeah

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
Perfect in every way, you already know

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
All I know is I love you so

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
Perfect in ever way, you already know

Come on baby, kiss me
Tell me "I miss you"
All I know is I love you so
