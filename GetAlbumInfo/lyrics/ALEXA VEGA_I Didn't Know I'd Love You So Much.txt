<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Dad, be still
There is nothing you need say
It can wait

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Shi, your mother's calling me... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Sometimes I wanted to cry
When the people on TV were not quite the way we were
Somehow I guess I just knew... 

But I didn't know I'd love you so much... 
I didn't know I'd love you so much... 
I didn't know I'd love you so much, 
But I do... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Sometimes I'd stay up all night, 
Wishing to God that I was the one who died
Sometimes there's not enough time... 

But I didn't know I'd love you so much... 
I didn't know I'd love you so much... 
I didn't know I'd love you so much, 
But I do... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
I didn't know I'd love you so much... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
I didn't know I'd love you so much... 

<i>[Alexa Vega and Anthony Head:]</i>
I didn't know I'd love you so much, 
But I do... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Shilo, go... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Dad, I will not leave you here
You will live... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
But you've already saved me, dear... 
Now go and change the world for me... 

<i>[Alexa Vega and Anthony Head:]</i>
And we will always have each other
In our time of need... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Shilo, you're the world to me... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Daddy, you're the world to me...
