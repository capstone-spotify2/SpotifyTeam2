Is there anybody
Who can help me out?
I'm picking up the pieces
But they keep raining down

Is there anybody
Who can end this war?
We've been fighting for so long
I forgot what we're fighting for

So Father, can you pardon our sins?
Tell me how we lost the answer
To this question

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hand
What is love?
Will we ever understand?

'Cause you can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause you know
I think we're starting to forget

Have you ever wondered
What went wrong?
Though we rose from the mud
We're drowning in the flood
It goes on and on

Heaven is waiting
Like an open door
I want to go there with you
But is there room for more?

So Mother, can you save us again?
Or is it you that needs the saving
From your own children?

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hand
What is love?
Will we ever understand?

'Cause you can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause you know
I think we're starting to forget

All that we're given
From beginning to the end
So tell me now, what is love?
What is love?
Can you tell me now

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hand
What is love?
Will we ever understand?

That you can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
That you can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get

No, you can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause you know
I think we're starting to forget

All that we're given
From beginning to the end
So tell me now, what is love?
'Cause you know
I think we're starting to forget
