Through the ages Your songs are ringing
All of Heaven sings around Your throne
Singing Holy God Almighty
The One who was and is and is to come

Great is the chorus of the angels of God
The glorious sound of Your name lifted high
Together we worship, together we cry
You are worthy, worthy

There's a Savior like no other
Hope abounding for the weak and poor
Everlasting is Your kingdom
Jesus you will reign forevermore
Forevermore

Great is the chorus of the angels of God
The glorious sound of Your name lifted high
Together we worship, together we cry
You are worthy, worthy
You are worthy, worthy

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
For the Lord God Almighty reigns

Hallelujah

Great is the chorus of the angels of God
The glorious sound of Your name lifted high
Together we worship, together we cry
You are worthy, worthy

Great is the chorus of the angels of God
The glorious sound of Your name lifted high
Together we worship, together we cry
You are worthy, worthy
You are worthy, worthy
