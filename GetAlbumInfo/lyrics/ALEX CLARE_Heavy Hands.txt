When I lay down my weary head
And I recall all my actions
And the careless words I've said

I'm gonna make a bow, and when it's day
I'm not gonna make the mistakes
That I got wrong yesterday

If I think good, it's gonna be good
And I'll only say the words that I know all person should
If I think good, it's gonna be good
And I'll only say the words that I know all person should

Cause it ain't no secret
No, it ain't no secret
Cause it ain't, no, no, no, no

Heavy hands
Gotta carry them blandly, carry them blandly
Heavy heart
So you better treat softly, better treat softly

You might trip, you might fall

If I'm beat down, feeling small
I remember even giants have the tendency to fall
If the actions of a man can change the entire universe
I wanna change it for better, I don't wanna make it worse

If I do good, it has to be good
And I'm gonna be much stronger than I ever thought I could
If I do good, it has to be good
And I'm gonna be much stronger than I ever thought I could

Cause it ain't no secret
No, it ain't no secret
Cause it ain't, no, no, no, no

Heavy hands
Gotta carry them blandly, carry them blandly
Heavy heart
So you better treat softly, better treat softly

You might trip, you might fall
You might trip, you might fall
You might trip, you might fall
You might trip, you might fall
