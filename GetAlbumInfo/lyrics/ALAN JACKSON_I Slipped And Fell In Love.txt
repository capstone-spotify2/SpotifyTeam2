A drunk man walking down a rainy street 
A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet 
You look down and suddenly you're looking up 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love 

A bald tire running on an icy road 
A steep hill underneath a foot of snow 
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love 

I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel 
It's just like flying but you're standing still 
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love 

An ice cube hiding on your kichen floor 
A bad step leading up to your back door 
How'd I wind up on my butt 
Whoops, I slipped and feel in love 

I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel 
It's just like flying but you're standing still 
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love 

I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel 
It's just like flying but you're standing still 
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love 

Help, I've fallen I can't getup 
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
