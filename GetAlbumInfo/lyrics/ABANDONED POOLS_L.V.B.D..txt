Welcome to the world
My little virgin baby doll
Can you save me?
I set you off
With the tip of my tongue
Spinning
Never coming back

I wanna dig for gold
Wear the crown of forever lost souls

I'll be nothing
Forever

Jill went up the hill
And gave herself the will
To kill her fear
Now she's unstoppable
Indestructable
The incorruptible
Forever lost soul 

Just a mercy kiss
Born of emptiness
I'm so sick of this
And your fakin'...
