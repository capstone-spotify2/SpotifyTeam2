I'm more than the colour of my skin
I'm the girl that likes to sing
All I know is whats within
Just the brown girl in the ring
Go to school and learn their ways
Don't have to think at what to say 
While my mother sits to pray
I pray for better days
God please help them see
They ain't no different from me
Not above, not beneath 
Teach them equality

I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring 
I'm a girl, that likes to sing
I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring
I'm a girl that likes to sing 

I'm more than what they think of me 
More than the colour tones that they see 
More than urban and r&amp;b, more than a slang that I speak
Close your eyes, don't say your word 
Don't speak about what you seen or heard  
Lets pretend that it's ok 
Just the way the devil likes to play 
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
I can't lie I can't lie 
All these years of my life 
I'm just from the outside 

I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring 
I'm a girl, that likes to sing
I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring 
I'm a girl that likes to sing 

And if you don't know by now 
Time will show you what, I'm talking 'bout
Said if you don't know by now
Time will show you what, I'm talking 'bout
I'm talking 'bout

I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring 
I'm a girl, that likes to sing
I'm not just the brown girl, in the ring
I'm a girl that likes to sing
