This year has been one crazy year,
and I've changed, that's what I feel.
I was just starting to like who I was,
Now I'm not sure who I am.

Had a dream last night, of a few years ago
sitting underneath the tree.
I was smiling wide, laughed as my brothers would fight,
over the stupid TV.

And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 

The city sounds like a lullaby so sweet, at least, to me.
Cuz' this town is quiet, and old to believe, doesn't feel,
like Christmas and all of me.   

And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 

Woah - oh- oh
Oh woah - oh- oh

And my brothers moved out just last week, and I'm scared of be lonely.
I have never been just on my own, right now I wanna go home.
And April really gets on my nerves, but I kind of miss her now. 
Cuz we're all the things, that bug me, she's the only sister I every known. 

And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas.
