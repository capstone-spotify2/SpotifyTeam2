A screaming match again
Could this be the end
A breaking point and I can't bear it
You wanna know the truth
The map to life is long
I've taken every wrong direction
Writing on the wall
Love once strong now falls
I'm staring into space
And drowning under my decisions

I wonder how you can sleep
At night, having lied to these eyes
You could feel the relief
The lying awake at night
Wondering nowhere the same time
To know his face and his name
Made me lose my mind
I fell apart for the last time
These eyes neglected to see it
And thanks to you
My conscious finally feels clean

I brought you into this
You blame me over that
We fight each others accusations
You wanna know the truth
The truth is I'm afraid
Afraid of going nowhere always
Writing on the wall
Love once strong now falls
I'm burning in the flames
Covered with the scars of our love

I wonder how you can sleep
At night, having lied to these eyes
You could feel the relief
The lying awake at night
Wondering nowhere the same time
To know his face and his name
Made me lose my mind
I fell apart for the last time
These eyes neglected to see it
And thanks to you
My conscious finally feels clean

Lately, lately
I just keep wasting, wasting
To make me hate me, hate me
Maybe we just don't belong
Again, is this the end

After what you put me through
I feel nothing for you
