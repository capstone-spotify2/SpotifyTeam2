MUSIC ... FOR ... CARS <i>[baby voice]</i>

Handle with care,
You better beware,
My bassline'll tear through your sub, I'm a take u there,
Like I'm a Vauschsprung Dauch Technics sound arranger,
Green, amber, red yo it's time 4 some danger.
Vrooom, listen 2 my bass go boom,
As u ride the nite u playin' my new tune,
Digital, on-board, satellite guidance system, Navigation yo I twist em',
Beige with the black two-tone,
Yo I even got the system hooked up to the microphone,
So I can rhyme while I'm ridin'
Window's down,
I'm goin' at the green lights... 
How u like me now?... 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Music 4 Cars <i>[4 times... techno voice]</i>

Hit the highway,
I gotta do it my way, ya like that
TV's in the headrest playin' "Friday".
Jay-Kay style I'm a roll with the 3 6 0,
The Benz coupe or the 4x4,
It ain't nothin' but the style I set,
I can't help but drop whatever u can't get.
I got Wookie on the sound,
U feelin' me now,
Educating brothers on the road that don't wanna be down.
I'm like...
Hold up,
Wait a minute,
New <i>[X5]</i> and yer girlfriend's in it.
Playboy I'm a always be,
And next time that u ride, yo check 4 me.

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[RAP]</i>
Yo I'm a blow. blow, biggidy, blow u all diggidy down,
Bringin' it 2 ya when it comes around,
I don't clown,
It's just a breakdown.
Figgidy feel my flow,
My riggidy rhyme like a virus actin' like u don't know,
Got u all riggidy runnin' 4 cover
There ain't no other MC bringin' it hotter,
Wiggidy word to yer mother.
Gimme the EX, gimme the CLA,
Gimme the MAI, Gimme the TION,
Figgidy full, stop my rhyme, diggidy done.

<i>[CHORUS and fade]</i>
