You tried to make me feel
Our love could be real
And I tried, tried to make you feel
You and me have a chance

We tried to understand
Promises have to be kept
But it's only a game
Where both of us hope to win

But I just found the first little cut
And I wonder why, oh God, but so what

It's hard to understand - and find a way
To give you all my life
Hard to understand - and hard to say
To give you all my life

Well, I pretend tonight
Our life is alright
But I feel the weakness now
Of living with a lie

I'm acting sweetness
But I'm burning in hate
'cause I can't stand you hurting me
The same way I hurt you

But I just found the first little cut
And I wonder why, oh God, but so what

It's hard to understand - and find a way
To give you all my life
Hard to understand - and hard to say
To give you all my life
It's hard to understand - and find a way
To give you all my life
Hard to understand - so hard to say
To give you all my life

It's hard to understand - and find a way
Hard to understand - to understand
Hard to understand - you and me have a chance
To give you all my life
I'm burning in hate 'cause it's just a game
To give you all my life
It's hard to understand - so hard to understand
To give you all my life
Hard to understand - so hard to say
To give you all my life
