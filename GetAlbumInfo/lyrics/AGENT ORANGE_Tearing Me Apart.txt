i've seen it all before - time and time again
as close as i would ever dare to be
and yet without a doubt - i will disagree
the sudden truth is no surprise to me

i know there is no easy way
i've said it from the start
sometimes you've got to live the life
and feel the pain
i hear a beat inside my head
i feel it in my heart
but just the thought of it is driving me insane
it's tearing me apart

i hear a distant voice - very far away
i'm silent now - i don't know what to say
i've felt a strong desire
to set myself on fire
i don't think that would work for me today
