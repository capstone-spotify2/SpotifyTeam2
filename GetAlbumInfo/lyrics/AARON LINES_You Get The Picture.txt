Barry White, he woke me out of my sleep
"Love Unlimited" on infinite repeat
I live alone, so why's the shower running?
My mind is groggy - my memory's foggy
The smell of incense lingers in the bedroom
I can't believe it's already past noon
On my arm there's a strange new tattoo
Shirt on the fan blade - pants on the lampshade

You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
Empty bottle of tequila, Jose Cuervo margaritas
Popcorn and a game of Twister
You get the picture... you get the picture

A book of matches on my dresser from the Sky Bar
Doggie bag from Dos Amigos
That valet parker still has the keys to my car
Piece by piece, it's coming back to me
I met my buddies after work
We shot some pool, a couple beers
Before I knew it, we were rocking
Met some girls, we started talking
It's not like me to get nervous, but she was perfect

You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
A mariachi band was playing, she was dancing close and swaying
Fireworks when I kissed her
You get the picture

Suddenly, the shower opens in a cloud of steam
Standing there, the woman of my dreams

You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
You get the picture
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture
