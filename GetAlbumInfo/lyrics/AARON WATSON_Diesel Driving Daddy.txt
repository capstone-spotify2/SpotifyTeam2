Well my truck's wound up and it's ready to roll 
I got a good buddy workin' for the Highway Patrol 
So if I get a ticket or two, It's gonna be alright 
But the sheriff and his boys they're in Estilline 
Unless they're out to lunch at the Dairy Queen 
They'll be itchin' to turn on those red, white, and blue lights 

Well just like my daddy I was born a drifter 
I got a rebel heart and eight - ball shifter 
Horns on the hood and forty channel CB 

Well some things you never leave home without 
Like your Bible, log book, and your drivin' route 
And your Best Of Dale Watson on CD 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Cause I'm a diesel drivin' daddy 
Don't you get in my lane 
Puttin' the pedal to the medal 
Bringin' eighteen wheels of pain 
I've been in love 
Broke some hearts 
Settled down long enough to replace the parts 
Kicked a little 
Asphalt along the way 

There's a lonely life livin' on the road 
When the only friend you've got is the radio 
And even he fades in and out every now and then 
But maybe someday you'll find the right one 
That'll shift the gears and let ya ride shotgun 
Knows how to get that big ole rig to spin 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'm a panhandlin' manhandlin' 
Post holin' high rollin' dust bowlin' daddy 
I ain't got no blood in my veins 
I just got them four lanes 
Of hard Amarillo highway 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Up and down that honky tonkin' highway
