Pretty darling, stop running down my street
The tears are dropping like a nuclear meltdown
I never meant to let it come to this
Can we blame it on timing not chemistry
All night long, i'll sing the same somber song
Attack my decisions, and the horse they road on
Everything seems to be less that zero
A mascara hero with a heart of zinc

I never should have kissed...
I never should have...

And i never should have kissed those lips before
I never should've let you out my door
But now i'm stuck with your photograph

The words you chant, i never thought they'd
Be so true, dancing in my head
So pause this moment, till we meet in our next life:
A black tabby housecat, a bottle of xanax
All night long is one repeated love song
When have i became this tree
Till we meet in our brand new world
I'll count the rings, if you tie a string
