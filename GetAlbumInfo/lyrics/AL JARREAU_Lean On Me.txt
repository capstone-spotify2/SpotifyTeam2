Sometimes in our lives 
We all have pain 
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise 
We know that there's 
Always tomorrow

Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please, swallow your pride
If I have things 
You need to borrow
For no one can fill 
Those of your needs 
That you won't let show

Just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

So just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load 
You have to bear 
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road 
I'll share your load
If you just call me

(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me) If you ever need me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
