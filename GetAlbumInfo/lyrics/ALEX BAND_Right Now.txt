Called you up
In the middle of the night
Had to talk
Hear you tell me that
Everything's all right
See I had this delusion
That I was losing you
Just a nightmare
I could have sworn it was true
Oh, what would I do?
You're all that I want and I'm not giving up on you

Right now, right now I'm here
Right now, right now you're here
Right now, holding you close to me
I know that some things are meant to be

We could live along the shore
Dance across the water
Underneath the stars
I'll give you anything you want, you want
Just as long as you always want me
So please just feel alive
Before we run out of time
Ride the tide
And carry us in to the moonlight
Do you feel like, I do?
Well do you. do you. do you?
Well I've got everything that I could want now that I've got you

Right now, right now I'm here
Right now, right now you're here
Right now, holding you close to me
I know that some things are meant to be

I have fought a thousand wars
Been through hell and knocked on heaven's doors
Born from the dirt of the earth
Just to love and be loved in return

I'm here
You're here
I'm where I want to be
I could swim inside our love
God only knows that it's big enough
For the two of us

Right now, right now I'm here
Right now, right now you're here
Right now, holding you close to me
I know that some things are meant to be
