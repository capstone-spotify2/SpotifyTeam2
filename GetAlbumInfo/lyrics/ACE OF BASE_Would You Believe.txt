Would you believe in us if I said to you
I want to
Would you believe in us if I said I do
I want you
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back to stay
But there is a danger for you to overcome
Believe in us, I'll make you so happy

There is someone more than you
It is me and I can see
Here is a summer for us to heal again
I'm better off if we were more than friends

I know bad news spreading fast
Let the good ones win at last
For me and for us
Let's try again

Would you believe in us if I said to you
I want to
Would you believe in us if I said I do
I want you
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back to stay
There is a danger for you to overcome
Believe in us, I'll make you so happy

You're an open book to me
And I know your history
I'm in New York
Let's go to Central Park
I'll light your fire with my magic spark

I know bad news spreading fast
Let the good ones win at last
For me and for us
Let's try again

Would you believe in us if I said to you
I want to
Would you believe in us if I said I do
I want you
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back to stay
Would you believe in us if I said to you
I want you

I want you

Would you believe in us if I said to you
I want to
Would you believe in us if I said I do
I want you
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back to stay
Will you, will you believe in love
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
