Mirror mirror on the wall
Can you tell me who the realest?
I heard you're hating on the boy
I got you all up in yo feelings
And I just woke up in Zimbali
I just woke up in Zimbali <i>[x2]</i>
So now you know where to find me
<i>[x2]</i>

I made it out the hood and out the city
You did the same but you ain't living different
The street's is talking aba o feeli boy
You're starting shit that you will never finish
A ke tsena kasi it's a holiday
The plug is a switch up on some
Purple haze <i>[x2]</i>
A ke tsena kasi it's a holiday
I don't entertain a hater
I am all about the paper
Fuck a favour for a favour
If you owe me money make sure that you pay up (I say)
I don't entertain a hater
I am all about the paper
Fuck a favour for a favour
If you owe me money make sure that you pay up (I say)
You funny rapper should behave, man
Put some respect on the name, man
I could go quiet for years and years
And still come back running the game, man
They telling stories about me
Well I just woke up in Zimbali
Nigga if you got a problem
Then you know where you can find me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Can you tell me who the realest?
I see you're hating on the boy

And I just woke up in Zimbali

I'm shitting on you, tell me how you feel
I'm here to stay and you just came to visit
It's a given boy I thought you figured that I'm finna get it
Right from the beginning I was on a mission
Bet you thought that I was kidding
Ain't nothing new they ain't fucking
With us <i>[x2]</i>
Fuck 'em all I woke up in expensive
Linen
Bumping Future, Drizzy yelling "What A Time!"
I was nobody the other time
Never thought I'll see the other side
<i>[x2]</i>

No di lass I'm the one who's poppin' hambo buza ngami in Dubane they know
You funny rapper should behave
