It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our accents, oh, oh!
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast in midnight
To fall in love with stranger oh, oh, oh, oh!

Yeah, we're happy free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah!
Tonight is the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time!

Oh, oh, I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you!
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright;
We just keep dancing like we're 22
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!

It seems like one of those nights, this place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, oh, oh, oh
It seems like one of those nights we ditched the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah!

Yeah, we're happy free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah!
Tonight is the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time!

Oh, oh, I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you!
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright;
We just keep dancing like we're 22
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!

It feels like one of those nights
We'll ditch the car scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you!

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you!
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright;
We just keep dancing like we're 22
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!
Yeah, 22, oh, oh!

It feels like one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights
You're a picture perfect
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you!
