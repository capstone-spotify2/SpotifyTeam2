<i>[Intro:]</i>
Aye
Uh
Realest shit ever said that

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Every day I wake I'm tryina find a way to get it
Out here in the jungle, I'm just tryina make a living
Lord knows I'm sinning, have mercy on a nigga
Palm steady itchin, may God be the witness
My mama don't want for nothing, for nothing
My daughter don't want for nothing, for nothing
My niggas don't want for nothing, for nothing
We made our way out of nothing, nothing

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Man I don't I take my long way from drinkin hella sugar water
Was dreamin but that Bentley though cause I could not afford it
To the backseat of that Phantom, writtin deuces in the corner
Workin that 9 to 5, I swear I hated takin orders
Lord just bring me guidance, bills started to pilin
Mama was steady cryin and plus a marriage was dyin
I was so sick of the bullshit, never did have a scholarship
Daddy left me young, until this day I won't acknowledge him
How I motherfuckin did it
Yea nigga, we did it
Me and my niggas winnin, plus I made a couple million
Now my mama got a crib, plus the lastest Jag
Know I love my daughter, she a spoiled little brat
So it's...

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Okay now fresh up off the block, my nigga guess who out the hood
Made it out the struggle, got my people living good
Always wanted to ball and now I'm courtside on the wood
Had the biggest dreams, you could do it if I could
I swear to God a nigga live it, sky's never the limit
Go and get it regardless, them hard times are prevented
I just wanna see my daughter live a life I never had
If all my people starve I will sacrifice my last
Sun up to sun down nigga I be getting cash
Opportunity knock, I bet I never let it pass
I been through a lot of shit, seen better days
Kiss my baby girl then I go and get the cake
