Sleepless night
Bloodshot morning
Runway lights
London calling

We could be any place, any time, in any moment
It's a race to the line
Break away from the life that they sold ya
Pack a bag, say goodbye
All we know is go, go, go
All we know is go, go, go

We got, we got the life unbelievable
Sleep when we're dead
Live like we're invincible
We're young and relentless
Get up, get out your mind âcause you never know
No way to hit rewind once your eyes close
We're young and relentless
We go, go, go
We go, go, go

Jetlag daydream
No permanent address
It's like a memory fading
Of a New York sunset
Yeah, we could be any place, any time, in any moment
It's a race to the line
Break away from the life that they sold ya
Pack a bag, say goodbye
All we know is go, go, go
All we know is go, go, go

We got, we got the life unbelievable
Sleep when we're dead
Live like we're invincible
We're young and relentless
Get up, get out your mind âcause you never know
No way to hit rewind once your eyes close
We're young and relentless
We go, go, go
We go, go, go

All we know is go, go, go
All we know is go, go, go

We got, we got the life unbelievable
Sleep when we're dead
Live like we're invincible
We're young and relentless
Get up, get out your mind âcause you never know
No way to hit rewind once your eyes close
We're young and relentless
We go, go, go
We go, go, go
