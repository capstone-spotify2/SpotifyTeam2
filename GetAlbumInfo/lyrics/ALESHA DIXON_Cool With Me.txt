I'm finally up and I'm strong on my feet
Been through the war
And ?
Don't always want what I get
But I get what I want
?
'Cause I like your taste
Maybe I am just a girl that you need

Every drink I have just makes it worse
My mouth only mumbles
My convert stumbles ?
I crumble inside
And I just stumble

I just broken free
Got the whole world on my feet
I get crazy, I get crazy
I let you take this from me ?
I'm a superwoman now
Got my super powers out
I get crazy, I get crazy
Now that I'm cool with me <i>[x3]</i>

Now that I'm cool with me

Somebody hold me back
Before I make a mistake
There's only so many times a heart can break
Damn patient got me back for more ?
Maybe another time a place I'll let you in ?
Just trying to be happy ?
Waking up in my own skin
Stay sober girl, it really ain't working

You're the sweetest ?
Saying no no, just makes it work
My mouth only mumbles
My convert stumbles ?
I crumble inside
And I just stumble

I just broken free
Got the whole world on my feet
I get crazy, I get crazy
I let you take this from me ?
I'm a superwoman now
Got my super powers out
I get crazy, I get crazy
Now that I'm cool with me <i>[x3]</i>
