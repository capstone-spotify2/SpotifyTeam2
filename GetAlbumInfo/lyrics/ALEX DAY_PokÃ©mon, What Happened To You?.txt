I remember when there were only 150 of you
Well, technically 151 if you are counting Mew
But I digress, I guess I spent the best years of my little life
Surfing Cinnabar Island to get 126 Revives
And I miss the PokÃ©mon Center
I miss its' music, too
And the way that Snorlax looked like Lapras on water
PokÃ©mon, what happened to you?

In the old days, you only got one form of every kind
I could name all the Gym Leaders, didn't even have to try
But now you showed me Team Galactic, and Dark and Steel and eggs
Oh, I want my Red and Blue back when Ditto wasn't used for sex
And I miss the cycling road, don't you know
I miss the music, too
And I can't believe you used to be in black and white
PokÃ©mon, what happened to you

Now Legendary means nothing to me
Because one-of-a-kind creatures add up to over thirty
And I only want three choices for my Eevee
I don't want a rival if his name is not Gary

And how the hell do you pronounce Sweecoon, Sooisine, Sweesign, Sooisoon
I don't know

I miss holding down the B button 'cause I thought it made it easier
I miss surfing to the truck and using Strength to try and move it
I miss watching my Charmander evolve into a Charmeleon
I won't accept your Leaf Green, they'll always be Red and Blue to me

Yesterday I dreamt I was surrounded by Unown
They spelled the words "We're sorry on behalf of Nintendo"
"We don't get Poffins either, and SuperContests are so-so"
"And the PokÃ©dex was fine, it didn't need a radio"
And I miss the Team Rocket hideout
And I miss the music too
And why have Shinies if they're so impossible to find?

PokÃ©mon, what happened to you?
PokÃ©mon, what happened to you?

And I'll never again experience that joy of mine
Because you are incompatible with my brand new DSi
