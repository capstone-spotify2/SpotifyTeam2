I'm never out of place (out of place)
Where I can turn around and walk away (walk away)
'Cause in my mind I wanna slap your face (slap your face)
But I know if I do, I'm gonna catch a case (catch a case)
Just can't go 'round thinkin'

You can do what you wanna do
It ain't like that
I'm comin' after you
You'll see that (ooh)
This ain't your party
Take it down 'cause you ain't nobody

I'm in a kinda mood
Believe that
So sick and tired of you
My emotions are in control
I'm takin' the high road

Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "Shut up! "
But that'll be wrong, wrong

Oh, I really about to make a scene
I'm a put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road

I told you one more time (one more time)
But you must've thought I was a punk with mine's (punk with mine's)
Now I wanna fight you 'cause you let me believe (let me believe)
That you have your heart so right up in me (so right up in me yeah)
Just can't go 'round thinkin'

You can do what you wanna do
It ain't like that
I'm comin' after you
You'll see that (ooh)
This ain't your party
Take it down 'cause you ain't nobody

I'm in a kinda mood
Believe that
So sick and tired of you
My emotions are in control
I'm takin' the high road

Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "Shut up! "
But that'll be wrong, wrong

Oh, I really about to make a scene
I'm a put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road

You stole my love from me
And just let it go and now I'm hurting
But you won't do that no more, I'm here to teach you
A lesson that's valuable so you won't forget no more, oh

Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "Shut up! "
But that'll be wrong, wrong

Oh, I really about to make a scene
I'm a put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road

I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
