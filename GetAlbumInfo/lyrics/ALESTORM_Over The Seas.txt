Many moons ago, in a faraway land
We met an old man with a hook for a hand
He showed us a map that lead to treasure untold
He said, "I'll give ye the map, if ye give me some gold"

For some pieces of eight the deal was done
He gave us the map, our quest had begun
We gathered our crew and set sail on the waves
And we knew we'd be rich by the end of the day

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Through treacherous seas we reached the lost isle
And over it's shores we marched for many miles
Until we discovered where the treasure did lie
With gold coins and jewels gleaming inside

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest is done

And we will be home by the dawn of the sun
