You said you loved me
But you know that that's a lie
You've held another
So it's time to say goodbye

But I've made up my mind
Not to have my heart broken
'Cause the words that we'd spoken
Too harsh, too fast
Would make me a victim of a broken heart

Well, now the table's turned
'Cause if you want me to be cruel
I think it's time you learned
That I'm no simpleminded fool
I'll turn my back on you

'Cause I've made up my mind
Not to have my heart broken
'Cause the words that we'd spoken
Too harsh, too fast
Would make me a victim of a broken heart

Well, I've made up my mind
Not to have my heart broken
'Cause the words that we'd spoken
Too harsh, too fast
Would make me a victim of a broken heart
With broken dreams

Well, I'd rather have my dreams
Torn apart at the seams
'Cause I'd rather be seen leaving
With my head held high
And my heart still mine
And my pride so high
Not a victim of a broken heart
