I have known it
And I have felt it
I have known a woman's love
And I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love

And I know
I know I'll never understand it
All the little things that make it grand and
A woman's love
And I know
I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love

Well I have kissed it
Tried to resist it
I have missed a woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love

And I know
I know I'll never understand it
All the little things that make it grand and
A woman's love
And I know
I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love

Well I have needed
And I have pleaded
And I have lost a woman's love
And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love

And I know
I know I'll never understand it
All the little things that make it grand
A woman's love
And I know
I know I'll never come to face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love

And I know
I know I'll never come face to face...
