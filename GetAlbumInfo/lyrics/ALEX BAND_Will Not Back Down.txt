I let you down but I'll make it up to you somehow
In time you'll see it's true if my will is strong
And I know that as these days go on
You'll find I'll get to you if it's the last thing that I do

Every step you take, I'll be a second behind
Every move you make, I'll be the thorn in your side
And know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

I'm the sky, the stars, the moon, the setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

Some say I'm cruel
But nobody knows what I feel for you
My love, you're the only one, yeah
Do you understand?

I can't let you slip right through my hands
No, my love, don't try and run
See in my eyes, you and I are one

Every step you take, I'll be a second behind
Every move you make, I'll be the thorn in your side
And know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

I'm the sky, the stars, the moon, the setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down, oh, will not back down

Every step you take, I'll be a second behind
Every move you make, I'll be the thorn in your side
And know you can't fight this now
Oh

Yeah, ooh, every step you take, I'll be a second behind
Every move you make, I'll be the thorn in your side
And know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

I'm the sky, the stars, the moon, the setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down
No, I will not back down
No, I will not back down
