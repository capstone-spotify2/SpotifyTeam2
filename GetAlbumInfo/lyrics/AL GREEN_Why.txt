Tell me why
Why can't I hear your answer
Why do I feel so all alone
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into Your own
My God, the place I belong

I'm dedicated now
To the place I love
Nothing can hold me back
From the place of heaven above
The question to all these things is

Tell me why, why
How come I feel so
Why don't the moon beam go
Where the sun beam go
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into your own
The place where I belong

If you start to try to separate
The light from the darkness
Only my God will know
We shouldn't judge
We should walk our walk
And talk our talk
Nobody knows what God knows

I want to know the answers
To all of these questions
Tell me why, why
