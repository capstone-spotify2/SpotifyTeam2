It's been to long
I've been waiting to see you
Endless nigths I lie awake thinging what went wrong
I'm afraid that it's too late but I'm still hanging on
Where have you gone, mother
It's been so long since I've seen you
Can someone take me home
I can't take this anymore, mama

Are you thinking of me
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of bitter seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is...
Vindicationnn

I shut you out of my life
Erased you from my mind
Hey
Changed my number
Went to hide
But I still feel you inside

Where have you gone, mother
Do you know how much I love you
Can someone take me home
Can you take me home
Where I belong

Are you thinking of me?
Do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs, the ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication

Are you thinking of me?
And do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of bitter separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Ohhhh woah oooh
Is it worth a life time?
Ohhhhhhhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
