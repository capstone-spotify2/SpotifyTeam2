Don't need you holdin' my hand and tellin' me when,
I gotta disable the man like one of the damned,
It's not what I needed, I'm tired of feelin',
Like you just don't understand I got other plans,
And all you do is demand, it's more than I have,
It's not what I needed, that's what I'm feelin'

Like I need a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I know I gotta get away,
'Cuz I need a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I gotta gotta get away,

Don't need you dragging me down, I feel like I drown,
And I'm not hanging around, I'm outta this town,
I gotta believe it and that's how I'm feelin'

This ain't what livin's about, I gotta get out,
I wanna grab you and shout, I'm screaming it loud,
Just what I needed, it's just how I'm feeling

Like I need a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I know I gotta get away,
'Cuz I need a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I gotta gotta get away,

Don't need you holdin' my hand and tellin' me when,
I gotta disable the man like one of the damned,
It's not what I needed, I need a little getaway,

I'm looking for a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I know I gotta get away,
'Cuz I need a good time lately,
Gonna have a good time take me,
I need a little getaway,
I gotta gotta get away,

Need a little getaway,
Gotta Gotta get away,
Little getaway.
