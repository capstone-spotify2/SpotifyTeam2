Baby, how'd we wind up this far apart
Using words as weapons like daggers to our hearts
This standoff of indifference isn't solving anything
But baby, I've been thinking 'bout what I stand to lose
I can live without being right, so if I have to choose

I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your...

Footsteps down the hallway, the strength you have within
How much you say in silence, yeah, your breath upon my skin
Don't know who I am without you
Just like the very air I breathe

I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
Cause I can't live without your love

As we sit here in the quiet, there's a pounding in my head
I feel the weight of a thousand angry words between us
The bitter things we said
So I'm reaching out to you tonight
Yeah, I don't care who's wrong and baby, I don't care who's right
We've come too far to let this slip away now
I'm asking you, I'm telling you
I'm begging you

I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up

I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
Can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your love

I can't live without your love
I need you, baby
