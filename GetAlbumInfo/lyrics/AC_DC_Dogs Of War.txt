Dogs of war
Soldiers of fortune

You be a fightin' man
Make all the cash you can
Don't mix and feel your tide
They wanna risk their lives
Takin' all you can
Riskin' ain't in the plan
Feel the boots upon the ground
Trouble brewin' all around
Dodgin' the bullets, shootin' the missiles
Soldiers of fortune, such a pretty name
Face the game
Mercenary thing

We be the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)

I'll fire-fight in the night
Run away or die of fright
Keep in time, keep in line
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Dodgin' the bullets, shootin' the missiles
Soldiers of fortune, such a pretty name
Face the game
You mercenary man

We be the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
We be the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Bring in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
We be the dogs of war

Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Call in the dogs of war

Dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
We be the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (Soldier of fortune)

Marchin' through the nightness
Those mercenary men
