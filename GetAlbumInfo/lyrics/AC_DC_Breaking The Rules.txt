Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
The street jungle and the tough childhoods
Examinations done no good
Got crow bars and hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion not today
I get my kicks in my own way
Right ok
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule

Tough breaks in the neighbourhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Livin' like trash a society rash
Ready to break and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
And doin' time on the other side
No rebellion not today
Get my kicks in my own way
Right ok
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Tough breaks

Regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With the regulation rules
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
Breakin' the rules
Get ready
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready
Get ready
Get ready
Ready to rule
Take off your ties
And your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools
And your damn regulation rules
I'm gonna do things my own way
Everyday, everyday,
In everyway
I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules
