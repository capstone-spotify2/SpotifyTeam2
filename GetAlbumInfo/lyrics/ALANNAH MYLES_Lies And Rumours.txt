You're playin' with my thunder, heavens knows I sometimes wonder who you are
You're so sweet but on the street, who do you meet when we're apart
I see trouble rollin' off you like rain
But I look up and I see lightning again

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Between the lies and rumours, there's a world of mystery
But I believe in you, do you believe in me

I fell in love with danger, now I'm going through all these changes by myself
You're too cool to play by the rules, but I can't fool with someone else
People saying things I don't wanna hear
But something tells me we've got nothing to fear

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Too many heartaches, too little love, so many reasons for breaking us up
We've got something nobody knows, we got it good, you know I can't let it go

<i>[Solo]</i>

With all the lies and rumours, sometimes you gotta roll the dice
But I believe in you, and your cool blue eyes, baby

<i>[Chorus]</i>
