Good Christian men rejoice
With heart and soul and voice
Give ye heed to what we say
Jesus Christ is born today
Ox and lamb before Him bow
He is in the manger now
Christ is born today
Christ is born today

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So rejoice, O rejoice
Hallelujah Christ has come
So rejoice, lift your voice
Sing Emmanuel with us
O rejoice

Good Christian men rejoice
With heart and soul and voice
Now ye hear of endless bliss
Jesus Christ was born for this
He has opened Heaven's door
And man is blessed forever more
Christ was born for this
Christ was born for this

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So rejoice, O rejoice
Hallelujah Christ has come
So rejoice, lift your voice
Sing Emmanuel with us
O rejoice

Good Christian men rejoice
With heart and soul and voice
Now ye need not fear the grave
Jesus Christ was born to save
Calls you one and calls you all
To gain His everlasting hall
Christ was born to save
Christ was born to save

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So rejoice, O rejoice
Hallelujah Christ has come
So rejoice, lift your voice
Sing Emmanuel with us
O rejoice, O rejoice
Hallelujah Christ has come
So rejoice, lift your voice
Sing Emmanuel with us
O rejoice, O rejoice, O rejoice, O rejoice
