I dream Bob Dylan was a friend of mine <i>[x2]</i>

He was the owner of the house in which together we all lived
He slept between me and my wife in bed
Oh, the roof leaked in the kitchen
I never mentioned my collection of his albums
I never bothered him with intrusive questions

I dream Bob Dylan was a friend of mine <i>[x4]</i>

He got a warm sense of humor
He was outgoing like my wife
We'd hang out late into the night smoking joints and drinking wine
We'd go thrift store shopping for vintage electronics
Race remote cars in toy departments
We'd never talk about playing music

I dream Bob Dylan was a friend of mine <i>[x4]</i>
