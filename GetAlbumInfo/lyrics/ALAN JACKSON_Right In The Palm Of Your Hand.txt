A willing woman
A willing man
A five room house
And a wedding band
Believers believers
Once it begins
You know it don't take long
Til like two people in a heartbreak song
I wonder........ I wonder

well Ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasin the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
When it's right in the palm of your hand

Can't take back those things we said
So we watch it pass in seperate beds
Changing... were changing 
too little love and too much pride
You won't give in and neither will I 
like children ... children

Well ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
When it's right in the palm of your hand

Feet on the floor holding my head
Sitting alone on the side of the bed 
ive been thinking ... thinking
Trying to find where we went wrong
I just turned around and you were gone 
it's over... it's over

Well ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand 

and Ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
When it's right in the palm of your hand
