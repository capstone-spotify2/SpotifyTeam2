Tout pour toi
Liaison dangereuse

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I tried to write you a love song I thought I could
So far what I told, you misunderstood
It used to be so good
What went wrong with us
I remember our night in Montparnasse
You gave me a painting made of us
So I cherish our moments when we still were young

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I wonât give it up
Canât you see Iâm not strong enough
Donât call my bluff
A sunny, sunny day

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm doing it all for you
But youâre letting me down, you better turn around
Iâm doing it all for you
a-a a-All for you

Lâamour ou le neant

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Hand in hand on our journey weâre set for love
You and me against the world, we were never apart
So naive I could be, I thought our love would last

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I wonât give it up.
Canât you see Iâm not strong enough
Donât call my bluff
A sunny, sunny day

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm doing it All for you
But youâre letting me down, you better turn around
Iâm doing it All for you
a-a a-All for you

Iâm doing it All for you
But youâre letting me down, you better turn around
When I am singing the blues for you
a-a a-All for you

<i>[Mid 8:]</i>
Come to me honey, help me understand
About your feelings, about your plans
Just one more chance to hear my prayer

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm doing it All for you
But youâre letting me down, you better turn around
Iâm doing it All for you
a-a a-All for you

Iâm doing it All for you
But youâre letting me down, you better turn around
Iâm doing it All for you
a-a a-All for you

<i>[B-Hook:]</i>
All for you
I would do the same tomorrow, All for you.
Without no regrets no sorrow
