Oh yeah
Love me two time baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times girl
I'm goin' away
Love me two times girl
Once for tomorrow
Once just for today

Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Love me one time
I could not speak
Love me one time girl
You know my knees got weak
Love me two times girl
Love me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time, baby
You know my knees got weak
Love me two times girl
Love me all trough the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Love me two times baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times baby
Well, I'm goin' away
Love me two times girl
Once for tomorrow
Once just for today

Love me two times
I'm goin' away
