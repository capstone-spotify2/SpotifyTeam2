Now meet me in the shower in about an hour
You wash my back and I'll wash yours
Take ya to the bedroom, I'm in a sexy mood
You do me and watch as I do you
Two bodies vibrating, your manhood is escalating
Tongues touch, bodies trace, turn over, I don't see your face
Kiss your neck, your back, your toes, what's next?

Do you want me? (You can have me)
Do you need me? (I'm yours)

Anything you want,(I got it)
Anything you need,(it's yours)

Nobody's gonna do ya like me
All my ladies say yeah
