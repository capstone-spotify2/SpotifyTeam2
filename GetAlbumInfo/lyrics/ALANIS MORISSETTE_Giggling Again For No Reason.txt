I am driving in my car up highway one 
I left LA without telling anyone 
There were people who needed something from me 
But I am sure theyâll get along fine on their own 

Oh this state of ecstasy 
Nothing but road could ever give to me 
This liberty wind in my face 
And Iâm giggling again for no reason 

I am dancing with my friends in elation 
Weâve taken adventures to new levels of fun 
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body 
I can see the meltings of inhibition 

Oh this state of ecstasy 
Nothing but road could ever give to me 
This liberty wind in my face 
And Iâm giggling again for no reason 

Iâm reeling jubilation 
Triumphant in delight 
I am at home in this high five 
And Iâm smiling for no reason 

I am sitting at the set of cali sun 
Weâve gotten quiet for itsâ last precious seconds 
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin 
And we still hear the echoes of abandon 

Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me 
This liberty wind in my face 
And Iâm giggling again for no reason
