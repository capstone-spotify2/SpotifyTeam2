I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We hit the corners going 90
Lovin' blindly fallin' 
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild, we were reckless

We'd drive on down to the river 
Burnin' up those hot summer nights
Laughin' at the cowboys getting crazy 
Pickin' fights
It wasn't funny
When that deputy, caught you and me
Steaming up those windows 
And how your daddy never found out about it
Honey, heaven only knows

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I looked into your eyes and I 
Promised you forever
I believed it with all my heart 
I just didn't know any better
Gettin' over you took years
Aww despite those tears I cried
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Young, wild, and reckless
