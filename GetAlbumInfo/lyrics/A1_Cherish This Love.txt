Sorry for making you cry 
For turning away 
As you walk on by 
But baby I need to be strong 
And I need to move on with my life 
You know it's not that I don't care 
So don't make me feel bad
It's not fair 
Baby you know all the reasons 
I made my decisions in life 
Now a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do 
And a boy had to become a man 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you

It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 

You know it's not easy to do 
Turning my back on me and you 
But baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life 
Smiles they turned into tears 
And all of my dreams
They all disappeared 
Baby this cannot be right
So I'll turn down the light 
On our love 
Now a boy's gotta do
What a boy's gotta do 
And a girl had to do what she can 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you 

It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 

And everything that could gone wrong 
Has gone wrong at some time 
Now I can see the light 
It was love at first sight 
And I'm not gonna let this girl go 

It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
&gt;From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
Yes I Will
With you
