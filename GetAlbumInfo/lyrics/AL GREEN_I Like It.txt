Going to Paradise
No looking back
No time for thinking twice
Nothing do I lack
See I like it, I like it

There's nothing you can change
No substitute
Jesus is the one and only absolute
You see I like it, I like it

I finally found a love
And it's for real
I gotta let you know
I like it, I like it

Hey America
I want to tell the world about it
Hey America
Shout it from the mountains
Don't doubt it

You can turn a smile
And think I'm wild
Keep your own mind
Keep your own style
I like it, I like it
I finally found a love
That's for real
Gotta let you know
I like it, I like it
