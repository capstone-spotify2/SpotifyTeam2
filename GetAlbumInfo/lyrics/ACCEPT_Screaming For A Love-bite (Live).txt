Screaming for a love - bite
And you hide it, that it makes you feel alright
See your secret in a mirror
It's black 'n' blue and it happened to you
In the heat of the night
It hurts just the first time
Ooh, it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a love - bite
For a love - bite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a love - bite
Grinding makes so uptight
And you gotta face it, 'cause it decorates your neck
It's gonna stay there
Stay there for a long time
Just to remind you while you like it
When you went on and on
It hurts just the first time
Ooh, it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a love - bite
For a love - bite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a love - bite
Screaming for a love - bite
