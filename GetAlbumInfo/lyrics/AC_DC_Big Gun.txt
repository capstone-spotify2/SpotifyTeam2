Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruising around
In a big black limousine
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Terminators, Uzi makers
Shootin' up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Gettin' off and doing no good
If you ain't wise they'll cannibalise
Tear flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Preyin' in the human zoo
They saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Yeah
Show down
Ooooh yeah yeah
ye yeah yeah

Big gun
Big gun number one
mmmmmm
whoa whoa
yeah yeah
b - b - b - b - b - b - b
Big gun, got a hot one
Big gun, got a number one
Big gun, loaded and cocked
Big gun, hot hot hot
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it, give it a shot, c'mon

Terminator, Uzi makers
Regulators, gonna get you later

Big gun kick the hell out of you
