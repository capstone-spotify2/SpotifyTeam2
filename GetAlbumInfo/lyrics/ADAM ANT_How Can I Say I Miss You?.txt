Oh you are the apple of my eye
And you are the sugar in my tea
Oh you are the mother of my child
And you are the wonder for me

How can I say I miss you
How can I go a day
How can I say I miss you
When you never ever go away

Oh you are the apple of my eye
And you are the sugar in my tea
Oh you are the mother of my child
And you were the one who satisfied me

So how can I say I miss you
Tomorrow and a today
How can I say I miss you
When you never ever go away

Yeh yeh yeh
Come on boys
Yeh yeh yeh

You are

Oh you are the apple of my eye
And you are the sugar in my tea
Oh you are the mother of my child
And you are the one who liberates me

How can I say I miss you
Tomorrow and a today
How can I say I miss you
When you never ever go away

Yeh yeh yeh
Never go away
Yeh yeh yeh
Woa woa woa
Yeh yeh yeh
Never go away
