All the world can't hold a candle to you
Cause' all the world is in the dark
Well I'll tell you why I'm so sure
Ooh! I took a shine to you

And all them ladies can't change your mind
And all them girls won't turn your head
And all them lions in the jungle at night
I don't worry 'bout my baby
Don't worry 'bout ya baby

Cause I know why I don't worry
I sing me no sad songs
Happy! Never sad for long
Don't you call me anything doll,
but your baby,
I know...

All them girls might wanna rip us apart
If they wanna fight they done started fucking with the wrong heart
They got another thing comin'
Or I'll be a dead woman

Oh, and I would do all that for you
I'd do it for you

Cause all them girls don't know you like I do
All them girls don't know you like I do
All them ladies don't know you like I do
That's why I call you my baby

Oh yea yea yea, ooh ooh ooh
Say alright, yea yea yea

So be mine <i>[x5]</i>
So
Be my baby <i>[x13]</i>
Just say alright <i>[x7]</i>
Forever and alright
