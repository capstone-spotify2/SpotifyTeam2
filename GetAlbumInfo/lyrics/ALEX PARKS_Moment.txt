You look at me 
I can see 
You through 
What you do to me? 

Aching for you to stop 
Yearning for all that you've got 

Don't you break on me 
I need you to stay 
Right by me 
Still touching 

You look, I watch 
But I can't reach 
Want to hold your hand so desperately 

Don't know who you are 
And we standing 
Stop 

You look, I watch 
But I can't reach 
Want to hold your hand so desperately 

Don't you break on me 
I need you to stay 
Right by me 
Still touching 
Don't leave
