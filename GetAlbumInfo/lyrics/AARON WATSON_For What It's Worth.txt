I just called to say good bye
But I was hopin' that you would beg me not to go
You where my only reason for stayin'
Besides the amarillo winters are to cold to spend alone

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So what its worth
I'll be in fort worth
Just in case you ever start missin' me
I'm gonna be right here in fort worth
So for what its worth thats where I'm gonna be

Before the pain I put you through
Those late night calls from those random county jails
I know I swore never to bother you again
But if you don't mind could you find the time to forward me my mail

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If you need a friend; a friendly conversation
You got my number and an open invitation

<i>[Chorus]</i>
