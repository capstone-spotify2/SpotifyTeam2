Day after day
I'm beginning to realize
The torture and pain
Are we going insane

Our vibrations
May be the push we need
We're restless at heart burnin' inside
Throwing it all away

There's a message in our life
It makes me wonder why
There's a vibe we can't deny

That's why we must
Break the ice - leave all the rest behind
Break the ice - and try in a way to hold on and stay
Break the ice - we know we can't deny
Break the ice - by taking the chance we're breakin' away

We gotta follow the lead
It's all part of the give and take
Where anything goes
Our spirits will shine

I won't be long
Before we realize
That we've given in
To the power of love - yes we do

There's a message in our life
It makes me wonder why
There's a vibe we can't deny

That's why we must
Break the ice - leave all the rest behind
Break the ice - we're throwing away what more can I say
Break the ice - leave it all behind
Break the ice

It doesn't help to cry
No need to wonder why
We hold it all in hand
Needless to say - needless to say

Break the ice - ice

We must
Break the ice - leave all the rest behind
Break the ice - and try in our way to hold on and stay

We must
Break the ice - we know we can't deny
Break the ice - by takin' a chance we're breaking away

Break the ice
