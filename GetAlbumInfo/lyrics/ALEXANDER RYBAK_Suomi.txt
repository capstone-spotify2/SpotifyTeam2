I used to be in search for beauty
Used to be in search for grace
Now I see your lakes and forests
You have put a smile on my face
Once I thought I'd seen it all
Now you show that life is so much more

Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
Suomi, Finland in my heart forever

The soothing view of smiles and laughter
Takes me back to dreams I've had
Losing you is life in silence
Diamond are forever, world map
The midnight sun that lights the scene
Now I know that beauty truly breaths

Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
Suomi, Finland in my heart forever

Suomi, Finland in my heart
Suomi, Finland in my heart

Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
Suomi, Finland in my heart forever
