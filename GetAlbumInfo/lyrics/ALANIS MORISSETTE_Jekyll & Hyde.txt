We're at once like peas in a pod
Like gloves around a hand
Our arms are wrapped around each others shoulders

And then we're on fire with parity
With standards of golden
With birds that are of feathers of predictability

And while I am flying high
You fly beside
Just when I start to drop my guard, then

Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde
I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside
Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde
When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side
I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde

<i>[Souleye]</i>
I thought there was a protocol
On how you treat a friend
Your hot and cold, I'd share my soul
But you're not listening
So I'm not stressing it
No pressure on my mind at all
Just curious about your split personality
Allegory double life
One moment's really nice
Next moment, exploding on me like it was dynamite
With no responsibility to be accountable
I guess I'm gone free away now from your hold

When you're kind, your kind is transcendent
Harmony rules the land
But sure as night turns to day, it is always uncertain

Just when I'm lulled by your sweet side
The harder the fall when you flip the script each time

Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde
I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside
Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde
When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side
Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde
I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside
Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde
When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side
I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde
I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde
