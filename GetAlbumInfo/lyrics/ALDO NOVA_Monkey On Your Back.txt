Let me tell you a story
About two kids in the city
See they both have a problem with life
And it isn't very pretty

There's a kid called Timmy
He used to be pretty witty
But then too many rides on the horse
Got him hooked and it's a pity

Cause now he's got a monkey
He's got a monkey can't fight it
Monkey
On his back he can't deny it
Monkey
He found a dragon that bites
A hole in his arm at night
Where all the money goes

Monkey, monkey on his back
Monkey, monkey on his back
A dirty monkey

Well there's a girl called Sally
She walks the streets in the city
She works down on the corner every night
Gives her money up to Willy

You see her man's Big Willy
And when he met her she was pretty
But he gave her a habit that she didn't want
Now that's a pity

Cause now she's got a monkey
She's got a monkey can't fight it
Monkey
She's gotta walk the streets to buy it
Monkey
She found a dragon that bites
A hole in her arm at night
Where all the money goes

Monkey, monkey on his back
Monkey, monkey on his back
A dirty monkey

Well now listen everybody
Cause there's a moral to the story
Clean up your act
Get the monkey off your back
Or you'll be sorry

Keep yourself clean
Cause the monkey plays mean
He'll put a knife in your back
Then the man in the black
Will show you a dragon that bites
And you'll wind up with a

Monkey, monkey on your back
Monkey, monkey on your back
Monkey, monkey on your back
Monkey, monkey on your back
