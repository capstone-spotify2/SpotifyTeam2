An inventory has been taken of every belonging
An estimated value sold in event of emergencies
The only backup plan in case it doesn't work out
In losing all semblance of coherence to a former self
You know I am becoming the choices we're making

No problems,
problems with everything
Problems, 
problems with everything
Oh God No...

Sometimes it's like conversations are a waking dream
A third party perspective
An audience to themselves
You can almost hear the sound traveling
It's caused a feeling of anticipation
When all of the sudden you know what's gonna happen
They saw the paranoids, they rebuild your world
They neither eat nor sleep they have no name you know..

Here in the worst, I will become, the best of them all 

No more problems,
problems with anything
No more problems, 
problems with anything
