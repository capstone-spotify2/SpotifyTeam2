He was a leader of a small gang
Commiting crimes each day
But time has changed where he was proud
It's so far away

He took living easy, his bad reputation
Oh, it was known all around
But he didn't care, no - he made dirty money
Now he is down and out

Thought he knew the tricks of life
Prowling in the dark
Now he's left by all his friends
'Cause he lived apart, of them

He was a leader, malicious and violent
His fame is covered with blood
Now he's just a number, he lost all his power
The king has lost his face

Down down down, oh, a king lost his crown
Caught and sentenced, he was guilty
Down down down, oh, a king lost his crown
It's too late for to hide
Late for to hide

He was a leader of a small gang
Committing crimes each day
But time has changed where he was proud
It's so far away
He took living easy - his bad reputation
Oh, it was known all around
But he didn't care, no - he made dirty money
Now he is down and out

Down down down - oh, a king lost his crown
Caught and sentenced - he was guilty
Down down down - oh, a king lost his crown
It's too late for to hide
Late for to hide
