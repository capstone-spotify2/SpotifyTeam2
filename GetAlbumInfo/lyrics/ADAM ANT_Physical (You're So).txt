You're so phy-si-cal

Eat your heart out, duet
I'll do it

I want to date you, maybe
I want to take you out
I want to wine and dine you
I want to twist and twist and shout

I want you hard in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the keys to my heart
When you wear that sweet dress, you know, the short one

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
You're so physical, physical
For me
You're just too physical, physical
For me

I want your rough house, maybe
I want this night in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I want to make this feeling clear, oo-hoo

I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I want to say all those things, dirty things
That would be better unsaid

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Oh, you're so physical
Oh, you're so physical
Oh, you're so physical
Oh, you're so physical
