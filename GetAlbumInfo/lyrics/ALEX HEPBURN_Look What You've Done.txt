Let me entertain you,
I'll be your puppet, pull my strings.
I'd like to fool, make you believe this is
All I'll ever be.
When I'm singled then I might leave <i>[?]</i>
'Tween the roads and abyss/and the bees <i>[?]</i>
You can call me what you want, I'm just a,
Me, I'm just a phase.

Look what you've done to me
Like what you see, honey?
Tears in the pouring rain.
I said, look what it's done to me
Like what you see, honey?
Tears in the pouring rain.

And I can't walk away, can't stay away.
I said, I can't get away, can't walk away.

Got the time,
I'd always been lonely.
Got the time,
I'd always been lonely.

Look what you've done to me
Like what you see, honey?
Tears in the pouring rain.
I said, look what it's done to me
Like what you see, honey?
Tears in the pouring rain.
