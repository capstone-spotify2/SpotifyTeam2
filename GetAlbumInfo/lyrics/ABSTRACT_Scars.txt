You clench your fist, she gives you a hug
Tell you she loves you, but you've been drinking too much
But you don't quit, instead you'd rather fuss
And take it to the point to where she can't get up
And it makes you feel sick, it breaks your heart
Cause you never meant for it to go this far
But you got a kid who has to live with the scars
They can only see you whenever there's bars

I need a medic
Yeah, I need a medic
Give me a medic
Yeah, call me a medic

She said I ain't seen him laugh in a long time
Seems life abandoned him to the wrong side
Remember the night they split and we all cried?
I think for certain a large part of my heart died
They brought me up thinking life was rainbows and sunshine
Grew up to find that time cruised and they all lied
For so long, convinced ourselves we were all fine
But the night he came back at three AM again was the last time
Alcohol consuming his breath
Mom said, "Don't you think of taking a step in this house."
Told you last time, one more time and you're out, so what now?
Is our family worth less to you than a night blacking out?
Slammed the door and then she dropped to the floor
Tears streaming down her face said, "I can't do it no more."
Said I tried to be strong for you, keep the family together
But it's healthier this way and in the end we'll be better

I said, "Don't you worry. No, that won't be us."
She said, "I'd like to know that, but there's not much I trust."
It's confusing cause I used to know their love that was
And it all went downhill in just a matter of months
She said, "You grow up fast when your fantasies die."
And nothing comes of wishing on the stars in the sky
What if it runs in my genes? What if I do it to you?
Your heart's been broken before, don't let me be the next bruise
I said, "What if the stars brought us together to bring your fantasies back?"
And you're a beautiful soul, why you've been thinking like that?
You're not like that, seen it in many of chats
You're your own damn person, you are not your Dad
He made mistakes and you learned from them
I've made my mistakes, you're what I earned from them
So we both know what love can be
So lets bring back the fantasies
Grab my hand, we're right where were supposed to be
