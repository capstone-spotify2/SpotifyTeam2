Open my eyes as I submerge and I won't deny what I've been since birth.
I'll die drowned by your standards.
Breathe in the life of the summmer's death as the orange and red breathe their first breath,
so welcome as they're burning through. We all begin to burn.
Autumn's flame dance's in my eyes Set alight for all we've learned.
My ashes falling. My skin is singed but it heals my heart and with glowing pride I'll wear my scars.
I'm honored by your hatred. Leaves fall we arise again, and the end impending, it will begin.
So welcome as it's burning through. Ashes fall and I'm rising up again.
Ashes fall. Ashes fall. Ashes fall as we all arise.
