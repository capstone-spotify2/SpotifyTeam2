Once upon a lifetime
I looked in someone's eyes
And felt the fire burning in my heart
For the very first time
She was scared and young
And had never tasted love
So I took her by the hand
And a boy became a man
Once upon a lifetime

And once upon a lifetime
You hold the queen of hearts
But if you gamble on a diamond
When the dealing starts
You stand to lose it all
As the cards begins to fall
An the lesson learned is hard
You're only dealt the queen of hearts
Once upon a lifetime

So if your taking chances know the chance you take
A broken hearts a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise
And the best thing seldom come along twice

Once upon a lifetime
You know that you've been blessed
When you hold your first born
Tenderly against your chest
The innocent you see
The value of a family
And you feel a special bond
That only comes a long
Once upon a lifetime

So if you taking chances know the chance you take
A broken heart a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fool's of the wise
And the best things seldom come along twice

And people only find
A love like yours and mine
Once upon a lifetime
