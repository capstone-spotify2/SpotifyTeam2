Left bank, I'm waiting for someone
Someone to be my friend
Outside, traffic's running slowly
I hear it from my window

Without you, I'm getting lost
Without you, there's no release
I can't hold the sun
I can't hold the sun

It's raining, love is not around me
How can it get soak?
Homesick, this is how I feel now
This is how you left me

Without you, I'm getting lost
Without you, there's no release
I can't hold the sun
I can't hold the sun

Without you, I'm getting lost
Without you, there's no release
I can't hold the sun
I can't hold the sun
