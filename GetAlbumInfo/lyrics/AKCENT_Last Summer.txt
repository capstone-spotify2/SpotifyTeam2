<i>[I:]</i>
I sit alone in the rain and my mind is dreamin'
(I'm still missing you...)
Many days have gone by but I can't stop this feeling
(Can't stop loving you...)

<i>[Prerefren:]</i>
Seems like yesterday when you walked away
I remember begging you to stay
To let my feelings show I must always know
I should've never let you go...

<i>[Refren:]</i>
Your love is like rain on a hot night of summer
Your touch will make my heart beat like a drummer
Don't run away, I need you to stay
Only with you I have strength to fly higher...

<i>[II:]</i>
I sit alone in my room and my heart is cryin'
Over and over again I remember you smilin'...
(I remember you...)
