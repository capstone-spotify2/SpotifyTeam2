Me, can't you see, I'm as right as rain
You, you're strung out and blue, but you'll be okay.

The sun's only heightened
It's all just a game
La la la

Look me in the eye, and please take my hand
Stop avoidin' and runnin' and building your house from sand.

I wish for a wave to crash
Wash all away
La la la la la la
La la la la, la la
La la la la la la, la la la la

Me, can't you see, I'm as right as rain
You, you're strung out and blue, but you'll be okay.

The sun's only heightened
It's all just a game
La la la la
