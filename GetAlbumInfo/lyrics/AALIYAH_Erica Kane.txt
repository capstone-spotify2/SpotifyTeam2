<i>[verse:1]</i>
she's back on the street her fear for night
feel you with grief she cuts like a knife
Make you do things that no others could do
she turns a professor into a fool
oh she ain't hard to get the girl gets around
and those that she met they're destined to drown
she'll make ya change like you like you never believe
she turns a working man into thief
oh

<i>[chorus:]</i>
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
she's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica (yo yo)
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica
she's Erica Erica Erica Erica
she's Erica Erica Erica(Erica Kane)
oh back on the block she's at it again
she'll be your friend as long as you spend
i know she torn whole familes apart
she shoot a posion arrow straight threw your heart
oh this is the day for Erica Kane
there's nothing to lose none for her gain
she'll make a honest man steal from his folks
and drain a million man until he go broke

<i>[chorus x2]</i>

<i>[bridge:]</i>
i really don't think you should mess around
cause all she'll do is bring you down
and there's nothing for you to gain
and she goes by this name...

<i>[chorus x2]</i>
