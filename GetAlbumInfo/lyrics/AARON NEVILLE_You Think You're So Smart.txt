You think you're so smart
Yes, you think you know it all
But the game you're trying to play
Can be played another way
And you see that, you never never had it so good 'till you met me

I brought you to the city
Now you tell me, there's no room for pity
My friends tried to tell me so
I told them they didn't know
That lights have gone to your head
You never never had it so good 'till you met, until you met me, oh until you met me
No you never, you never, you never had it so good
