I'm so tired, I need sleep
I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?
I make mistakes, but them's the breaks
I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it? 

Life's a bitch, and so am I
If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it?

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you, why can't you
So tough when no-one knows you
No homies, so lonely
Why don't you cry about it now?
