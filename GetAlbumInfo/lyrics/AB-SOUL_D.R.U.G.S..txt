I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I say I love my mama, Lord knows I does
I love my family, my cousins, that's my blood
I love this music, it come from up above
I love my niggas and I love my bitches
I love everybody that's listenin'
If you rich or poor, so what?
The whole world we livin' in
Everything that's livin' in it
Trees down to the bugs
Can't forget about my plug
'Cause last but not least I love drugs
I love drugs
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help

They say the apple don't fall far from the tree
Apple a day, it keep the doctors away
I wonder if my father got more faded than me
But I can't ask him, 'cause the doctors couldn't save him, baby
My mama clean as holy water, hallelujah
We total opposites, I'm dirty as this Fanta mix
We Qualitesters, we can't find no Hi-Tech, I ain't lyin', nigga
Act stashed on the low for the high, nigga
Whole squad full of them codeine fiends
OG by the OZ, and I still owe the weed man down the street
Monster magic off them Xannies, I might have me one
Mix it with the syrup, Perc' on top of that
Then I'll be numb, if I don't wake up, tell 'emâ¦

I love my mama, Lord knows I does
I love my family, my cousins, that's my blood
I love this music, it come from up above
I love my niggas and I love my bitches
I love everybody that's listenin'
If you rich or poor, so what?
I love the whole world we livin' in
And everything that's livin' in it
From the trees down to the bugs
Can't forget about my plug
'Cause last but not least I love drugs
Last but not least I love drugs
(Purple still comin' in)

Molly got me rollin', got me rollin', nigga
I got the sniffles, need a box of tissues (Blow it!)
I got some issues, I ain't talkin' about a newspaper
Talkin' about the issues that come with this new paper
My new bitch in the next room in the nude, nigga
Broad day, blinds openâsee the view, nigga?
Cornea, so scarred can't look myself up in the eyes
But if I could I would say: "Who is you, nigga?!"
What's become of Herb III's son?
Wasn't for these abortions I'd probably be on my third son
That was they decision, for the record
Just clearin' my conscience
That don't make it better, nigga
You know I know better, nigga

You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
Think I need some help
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh, so fresh, no
I think I need some help
Junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh, so fresh, no
I think I need some help
I love my mama
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh, so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky
Lords knows I does
I think I need some help, I need some help
I love my mama
I need some help, I need some help
Lord knows I does
Can you go find me some help?

(That's what I'm sayin'. That's why you don't need a Xan, cuz. I said time flies... Didn't you hear what I said? I said time flies. Time flies, love fades... Goddamn, man!)

Married to marijuana, addicted to cigarettes
Codeine's my concubine, cocaine confidant
Adderall Admiral, absolutely, give Danny credit
Perc' 30 flow, exactly how Saudi said it
Season pass to Xanny land, Hennessy in my piss
Can't forget I'm psychic off them psychedelics
And for the kids lookin' up to me for what I've seen
No, I don't need any of these things to do anything
Soul

All my brethren, I pray for your mercy
And that you alleviate my pain
You that dwell in the glory of God
Listen to the sufferance of this
Your humble servant
Grant me health, well-being, and happiness
Amen
