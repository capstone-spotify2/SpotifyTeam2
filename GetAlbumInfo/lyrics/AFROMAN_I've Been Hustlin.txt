I wanna say uh hustle up to all the hustlas out there, i love u man

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I've been hustlin
From dusk till dawn
I've been hustlin
For so long

I'm the hungry hustla afroman i recycle cardboard, beer bottles, and cans
Food stamps, bust token plus G.R. checks, underground rap tapes tryin to
get on deck

Hit the rap contest sellin weed on stage,
go to work for the man for minimum wage,
Slave hard, grave yard, every day get scard,
airport, fast food, security gaurd.
Slangin rocks all day
let my beeper just beep
Go to work go high, go strait to sleep
Wake up, bake up, then punch them clocks
Swerve them blocks, serve them rocks
Workin at the airport with Jivonni and Kid
Slangin everything the airport bring in
Cook crack sip yak stack cheese
Walk around sell my own cd's.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
I've been Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
for so long

Ghetto resident everyday get bent
with the 2 tall cans for 89 cent
Get money get fame get women get props
chillin kick it with my homies rippin rocks from the cops
walk slow around the corner then dash hall ass
if you run, run fast cus the cops might blast
Run, Shake, Break, bail
might as well cus it's hell in the county jail
Cut to the left (left) Cut to the right (right)
Run up in the house shut the door goodnight
Come back out bout 20 minutes later
braggin to the homies how i shook that hater
start back hangin start back slangin
rappin, sangin, system bangin
aint got no job aint got no credit
but whatever you need i'll get it

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
I've been Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
for so long

Afro motha fuckin M A N
tryna go to the top
not the federal pen
but i'm in the ghetto
my problems won't let me go
untill i go get some dough
only legal things
i can do for snaps
is program beats
and bust husla raps
made my first cd started slanging it
the boys in the hood started bangin it
but i couldn't get rich on my side of town
so i jumped in the cadilac and moved around
to the ?Slathlaswane? ?Kathaswalne?
even goddinna tell me have u seen her
dude named afroman from Palmdale
sellin cd's in front of Sell-u-tell
rap contest, partys, clubs, and bars,
from a homeless bum to the grammies with stars

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
for so long
