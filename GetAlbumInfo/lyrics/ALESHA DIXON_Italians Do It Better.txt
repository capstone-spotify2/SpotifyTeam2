Let's get creative
Thinking you could be my Romeo tonight
I bet you want to taste it
I got what you've been looking for
Come with me, alright
Let's get creative
Think of all the things we'd like to do and say
To get synchopated
Body close to body till harmony
They say

Italians do it better
Italians do it better
They say Italians do it better
You proved them wrong, you do it better

Because everything I want I get
And baby baby yeah you're next, you bet
Everything I want I get
Tell me if you can handle it

Slow down, I think I love this, baby
Throw down, don't keep me waiting
All night I know you want this, baby,
Playing around, hear what I'm saying
They say

Italians do it better
Italians do it better
They say Italians do it better
You proved them wrong, you do it better

Because everything I want I get
And baby baby yeah you're next, you bet
Everything I want I get
Tell me if you can handle it, I guess
Every part of me says yes, oh yes
And baby I don't ever want regrets, you bet
Everything I want I get, oh yeah
Tell me if you can handle it

This lipstick's all about to kiss you
Baby feel this, ain't no time for hugging
Come and take it, want you more than ever
Make me feel alive
Feel the vibe

Italians do it better
Italians do it better
They say Italians do it better
You proved them wrong, you do it better

Because everything I want I get
And baby baby yeah you're next, you bet
Everything I want I get, oh yes
Tell me if you can handle it, I guess
Every part of me says yes, oh yes
And baby I don't ever want regrets, you bet
Everything I want I get, oh yeah
Tell me if you can handle it

Oh oh, I'm a girl who can't say no
When it's you who says "let's go"
Keep the smile upon my face,
Don't let it go because it feels good...
