Love me with all of your heart
That's all I want, love
Love me with all of your heart
Or not at all
Just promise me this
That all you'll give me
All your kisses
Every winter
Every summer
Every fall

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment
Or an hour
Love me always
As you loved me
From the start
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heart

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Es tu palpitar
Es tu cara
Es tu pelo
Son tus besos
Me estremezco... a-a-ah

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment
Or an hour
Love me always
As you loved me
From the start
When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment
Or an hour
Love me always
As you loved me
From the start
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heart
