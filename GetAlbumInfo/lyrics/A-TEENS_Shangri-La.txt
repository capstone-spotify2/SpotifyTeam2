<i>[Dhani:]</i>
We got it going on
I canât tell right from wrong
You can say that when we kiss 
We've got lip-synch

<i>[Amit:]</i>
I know itâs getting late
But like a twist of fate
My clock stops when Iâm with you

<i>[Marie:]</i>
Though time is ticking way too fast
We can make this moment last
I donât want the night to end

<i>[All:]</i>
I can take you to my hide-a-way
My Shangri-la, my Shangri-la
You and I will see the break of day
In Shangri-la, in Shangri-la

<i>[Sara:]</i>
Câmon letâs roll the dice
The look upon your eyes
Says your mindâs made up
You donât have to think twice

<i>[Marie:]</i>
So whatâs it gonna be
Will there be you and I
Wanna try to make you see

<i>[Sara:]</i>
That time is ticking way too fast
We can make this moment last
I donât want the night to end

<i>[All:]</i>
I can take you to my hide-a-way
My Shangri-la, my Shangri-la
You and I will see the break of day
In Shangri-la, in Shangri-la

<i>[Marie:]</i>
You really make my head spin
Donât know where you end and I begin
But itâs not like I care

<i>[All:]</i>
I can take you to my hide-a-way
My Shangri-la, my Shangri-la
You and I will see the break of day
In Shangri-la, in Shangri-la

I can take you to my hide-a-way
My Shangri-la, my Shangri-la
You and I will see the break of day
In Shangri-la , in Shangri-la

I can take you to my hide-a-way
My Shangri-la, my Shangri-la
You and I will see the break of day
In Shangri-la, in Shangri-la
