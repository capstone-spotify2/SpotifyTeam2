Alright, alright
Alright, alright

Summer time so the vibe is right
Crank the base and dim down the lights
Don't know about you but we came here to get down tonight
Celebrate it quick vacation
All year we been steady and waiting
Now the sun is high in the sky
Let's live it up cause we got the time
I'ma cruise by your spot round eight
Nah girl I ain't gonna be late
They told me to take it slow but honestly I couldn't wait
Hit the city maybe hit the cap
Hit he coast and then bring it back
But one thing you gotta know

You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone

See the green that's in you're eyes
Only green I need to get high
Got me feeling like I'm the man
Know my story you understand
This music only a part of me
Love because you want all of me
Love because you know what I was
So you know all I could be
Don't treat me like Hollywood
On my grind but don't Ollie wood
I'm the kind to put a hole in one
But I don't play like I'm Tiger Woods
Spend the night out, spend it in
Long as you're who I spend it with
Make my money all independen
And your mind is money cause you independent
Hit the U, maybe Belle Town
Take a trip out and hit he sound
But there's one thing you gotta know

You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone

Wake up to no make up
You don't need that girl straight up
You a wild child lighting wild fires
Hit the ground and you spin the tires
Go million miles a hour
No I ain't fighting the power
No I ain't got the willpower
You got me hooked, I ain't sour
No tellin where this will go
But for the time well act like we know
Summer time and the feelings right
Can't describe how I feel tonight
All that matters I'm loving life
Missed the view from this kind of height
Do you good cause you do me right
Just hold me down and I'll hold you tight
It's summertime
And it's feeling right
But there's one thing that you should know

You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
Nah baby we ain't going home alone
You're way too pretty to sleep alone
