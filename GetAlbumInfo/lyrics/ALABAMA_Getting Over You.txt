Wish I had just one more chance
To hold you close and say I love you
Can't believe that our romance was just beginning
Now its through
I'm looking for tomorrow
To start a newlife on my own
And all I see is sorrow
You're all I lived for
Now you're gone.

I can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes,
But the tears keep fallin' through
The hardest thing that love has put me through
Is gettin' over you (over you) gettin' over you.

I can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes,
But the tears keep fallin' through
The hardest thing that love has put me through
Is gettin' over you (over you) gettin' over you
Over you.
Over you...
