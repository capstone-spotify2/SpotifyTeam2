Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light.

Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

Well the shepherds feared and trembled
When low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Saviour's birth

And they all were singin'
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

On this Christmas morning
The son of God is born in Bethlehem
<i>[x4]</i>

Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And God send us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.
That Jesus Christ is born.
That Jesus Christ is born.

On this Christmas morning
The son of God is born in Bethlehem
