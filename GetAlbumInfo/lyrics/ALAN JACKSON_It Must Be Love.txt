First I get cold and hot
think I'm on fire, but I'm not.
Oh, what a pain I've got,
it must be love!
There's nothing I can do,
all that I want is you.
Look what I'm going through,
it must be love!

It must be love, it must be love.
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove.
You must be the dream I been dreaming of,
oh what a feeling, it must be love!

Something is wrong or right,
I think of you all night.
Can't sleep 'til morning light,
It must be love!

Seeing you in my dreams,
holding you close to me.
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love!

It must be love, it must be love.
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove.
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love.
