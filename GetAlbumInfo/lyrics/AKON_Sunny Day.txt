Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)...

Block dont stop always stayed hot...
No matter how the seasons got..
I still remember when they took me away....
Kept it on lock den I got cuaght realised dat I had to stop...
Den I took the time to explore a better way...

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, theres a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Every day...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

I was born in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playing hide and go seek, with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo mona lisa can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay,
Itâs hard for to let go life in the ghetto
The night it blessed my cousin,
I had to find out a way out of my ghetto
Picked up the guitar and started singing in the ghetto
Haters use to hate in the ghetto
Said I never would made it out of the ghetto
Guess thatâs why my cousin to yoyo
Even though honey said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stayed dark
I never thought I ever see the billboard chart

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Every day...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
Been a long day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know theres more to see...more to me...no more living in misery...
Cos this is how I visioned life to beee.....

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, theres a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Every day...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
