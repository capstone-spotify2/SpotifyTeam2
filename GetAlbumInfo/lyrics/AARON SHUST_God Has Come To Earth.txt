All praise to You Eternal Lord,
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;
You chose a manger for Your throne,
While worlds on worlds are Yours alone.

Once did the skies before You bow;
A virgin's arms cradle You now,
and angels, who in You rejoice,
Now listen for Your infant voice.

They sing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth

Oh little Child, You are our Guest,
That weary ones in You may rest;
Forlorn and lowly is Your birth;
That we may rise to Heaven from earth.

Singing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth

All this for us Your love hath done;
By this to You our love is won;
For this we tune our cheerful lays,
And shout our thanks in ceaseless praise.

We sing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth
that God has come to earth
God has come to earth
God has come to earth
