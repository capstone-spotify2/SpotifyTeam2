Here I am
Fighting this war I stand
Wearing these scars on my hands
Everything's going as planned
Cause everyone but me understands

<i>[Chorus]</i>
We've all been there
I'm doing what I can
We've all been there
I'm doing what I can
We've all been there
Just doing what I can
We've all been there
Well do you understand

Here I go
Walking this long winding road
And I keep walking it all alone
Well never really sure of what I know
Just taking the tide as it flows

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Well do you understand the way we rise and fall
We're building just to break apart
All I know is that I have myself

Here I am
Fighting this war I stand
Wearing these scars on my hands
Everything's going as planned
Cause everyone but me understands

<i>[Chorus]</i>
