When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Like a ship against the tide
Still I know, there's a simple truth

I am Grateful
When I hear the saddest song
In that moment
I know I am not alone
Someone else, feels the same way too

<i>[Chorus]</i>
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break

Ever Grateful
For the scars along the way
And I'm thankful
For each mistake I've made
Cause somehow, It all led me to you

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break

When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Still so good to be alive
Cause I know, I shared it all with you
