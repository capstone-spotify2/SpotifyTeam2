Suddenly I'm famous,
And people know my name.
I've got a thousand girls just waiting,
And therefore it's a shame
That my heart has been captured
By your funny little smile.
And finally I'm happy,
If only for a while.

People call me stupid,
For treating you like a queen.
But I don't even worry,
'cause you're my unforeseen
And I hope that you'll be with me,
If only in my dreams.
But here you are next to me,
And you're glad, or so it seems.

And I don't know for sure
Where this is going.
Still I hope for more, and more.
'Cause who would know that you
Would treat me like a boy,
And I treat you like a girl,
In this funny little world.

Don't promise me for ever,
Just love me day by day.
No one knows the future,
We're young, but that's OK.
'Cause you'll always be a part of me,
Whatever life will bring.
And people have to bear with you,
This silly song I sing.

Your boyfriends might be angry,
My girlfriends might be blue.
But no one can deny it,
From now on I love you.
I have to say it's new to me,
This feeling in my heart.
Guess I've been kind of lonely,
And you've been kind of smart.

And I don't know for sure
Where this is going.
Still I hope for more, and more.
'Cause who would know that you
Would treat me like a boy,
And I treat you like a girl,
In this funny little world.

And I don't know for sure
Where this is going.
Still I hope for more, and more.
'Cause who would know that you
Would treat me like a boy,
And I treat you like a girl,
In this funny little world.

This funny little world.
