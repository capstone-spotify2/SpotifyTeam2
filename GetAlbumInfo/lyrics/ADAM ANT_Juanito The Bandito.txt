Lock up your shed because Juanito's coming
Just crossed over into Mexico
Lock up your pigsties and your daughters
'Cos if it moves, you know old Juanito

Young ladies he likes to ravish
He knows how to make them wet
And if he can't, he know he dig himself a hole
Or go looking for your favorite pet, olÃ©

They call him Juanito the Bandito
Lock up your things, you'll be robbed
They call him Juanito
The randy bandito
Oh, how many people have sobbed his name?

He wears a soft sun-soaked sombrero
A droopy moustache to his chin
He will hold up stab or shoot you
So that he can get it in okay

(Alright) they call him Juanito the Bandito
Lock up your things, you'll be robbed
They call him Juanito
The randy bandito
Oh, how many people have sobbed his name?

My son, I tell you... don't bother 
I'm going downtown with the guys okay?
