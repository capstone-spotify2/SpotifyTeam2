There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby! Tonight, yeah, baby!
And I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight 
You need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby! Tonight, yeah, baby!
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight

It's hard to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge,
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, yeah, yeah

Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby! Tonight, yeah, baby!
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright! Alright!
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby! Tonight, yeah, baby!
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight

It's hard to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge,
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you.
