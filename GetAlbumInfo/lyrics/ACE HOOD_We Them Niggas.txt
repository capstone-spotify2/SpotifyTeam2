Anybody seen a waitress? Tell her bring more liquor
All my dawgs in the building, and we smokinâ on that killer
Anybody know a hater? Middle finger to the ceiling
Feelinâ like John Gotti â canât nobody fuck with us (turn up)
We them niggasâ¦ we them niggas, we them niggasâ¦
All the bad bitches know it (all the bad bitches know it)
We them niggas, we them niggasâ¦
Middle finger to the ceilingâ¦
We them niggas, we them niggasâ¦
We donât really give a fuckâ¦
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Iâm screaminâ âfuck them other niggas âcause Iâm down for my niggasâ
Middle finger to the ceiling, everybody keep calm
âCause youâve got some real niggas in the building
And you donât really look familiar â thatâs your girl?
My bad, in my ear sheâs been begging me to hit her
Oh lord! Oh lord!
Have her really catching feelings all night from the club to the villa
Know youâre chilling with the realest, I ainât even gotta say it
Blowinâ money, I donât really mean to litter
We them niggas, we them niggas from the bottom to the top
Yâall mad? LOL â go figure
Balmain on the feet, twenty bottles of the peach
On the way, light âem up, light âem up
I donât really give a what, I donât really give a what
Mess around, Iâmma buy the whole club
Iâm just really showinâ love
That gonâ probably get âem mad, so sad
All haters need a hug
Take a hit of these drugs, gettinâ high with my dawgs
âTil the maâfuckinâ sun come up
Let it pass, puff puff

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
I let them haters keep talkinâ while the money pile up
I pull up in a two-seater, you see him with a badass bitch
Lilâ nigga, thatâs a must
Good Lord! Good Lord!
Man, her ass so retarded it belong on a short yellow bus
And she rollinâ with them niggas, but she knew that already
Yeah, we heavy in this bitch like âwhat?â
Now where you from, where you from?
Donât nobody else matter but your day one niggas from the jump
Yeah we started from the bottom with a dream and a dollar
Keep it real, shorty, I know you wanna fuck
Amen! Amen!
Swear this watch that Iâm wearinâ on my wrist
Man, this shit is pretty rare
Everything I do big, all I do is set trends
You can try it, donât nobody really care
Donât nobody really care
I can show you my committee, in my city
Boy, Iâm treated like the mayor
Way the bezel gold is shining on a 100 grand Rollie
Boy, it really ainât a choice but to stare
Iâm just keepinâ shit playerâ¦

Let me hear you say âfuck the niggasâ
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas
Let me hear you say âfuck the niggasâ
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas
Let me hear you say âfuck the niggasâ
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas
Everybody know they canât fuck with us
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
âCause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
