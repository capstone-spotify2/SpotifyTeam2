I believed I could see a day you would want me, like I want you
You would need me, like I need you to
There was a moment I thought time might change your mind
And there'd be a place there for me in your life

But I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel

And now as I walk away, I won't look back, I won't break down
What I was living for, I'll have to live without

There will be moments I'll think how it might have been
But baby now this is how it must end

Cause I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel

No, I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby
You never gonna change you baby, no
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel
