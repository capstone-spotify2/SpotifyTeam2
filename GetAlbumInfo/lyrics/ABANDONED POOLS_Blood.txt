I see the happy the family tree
It sways so easily
We're smiling all the time
This world just isn't mine

We watch it burn
And we never learn
This can't be what you're waiting for
Staring into the sun
We eat our young
This can't be what you're waiting for

Just take it easy on yourself
Forget all the stupid things we say
I know you beat up on yourself
I know it's in your blood

You say what no one understands
The seeds are in your hands
The branches break your bones
I can't just leave you alone
And watch you squirm

And I can't bring myself to look
I rip the pages from the book
And watch it burn
