Come hang out
'Cause you're outta your mind
You're working so damn hard
You forgot what you like
And come hang out
Don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time

I can't complain, no, I won't be mourning
'Cause I skipped on prom
For Elvis Duran in the morning
All of my life I have been starving
Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist

I'm gonna miss it someday
I missed another Friday
And all my friends say 

Come hang out
'Cause you're outta your mind
You're working so damn hard
You forgot what you like
And come hang out
Don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time

Last album sales could have been higher
Maybe that's why I haven't seen friends in awhile
Dare at a bar down in the Bahamas
I'm doing promo tryna blow up in Chicago

I'm gonna miss it someday
I missed another Friday
And all my friends say

Come hang out
'Cause you're outta your mind
You're working so damn hard
You forgot what you like
And come hang out
Don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time

Come hang out
'Cause you're outta your mind
You're working so damn hard
You forgot who you like
And come hang out
Don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time

Come hang out
Cause you're missing a lot
You haven't gone that far
You can find a real job (find a real job)
And come hang out
We can save you a shot
But I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time

Should I go for more clicks this year?
Or should I follow the click in my ear?

Come hang out
