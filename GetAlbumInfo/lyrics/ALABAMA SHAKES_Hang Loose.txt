Don't worry, sweet baby
Don't you ever worry about a thing
Put them worries on the shelf,
learn to love yourself
Don't be your own worst enemy

Hang loose, hang loose
Let the ocean worry about being blue
Hang loose, hang loose
Roll with the tide and I'ma
take care of you

Come with me sweet darlin'
I got us each a ticket for the plane
We're gonna fly to Waikiki,
 it just be you and me
And we'll let the sun melt our cares away

Hang loose, hang loose
Let the ocean worry about being blue
Hang loose, hang loose
Roll with the tide and I'ma take care of you

Alright, we gonna be alright
Alright, you're gonna be alright

Hang loose
Hang loose
Hang loose
Hang loose
