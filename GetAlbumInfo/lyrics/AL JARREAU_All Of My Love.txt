No one's ever held me like you hold me
No one's ever touched me in this way
But I'm not runnin' anymore
never felt this way before

<i>[Chorus]</i>
All of my love I will give to you
all of my dreams will be comin' true
In the heat of a tangled kiss
Say you will and I promise you this
All of my love I will give to you
All that I ask is you love me too
take a look, I'm never far behind
turn around and gimme gimme gimme a sign

I will put my feelings into one place
center my emotions on your face
I could spend a lifetime sharin' night time
'Cause when you're lyin close to me
somethin' tells me that you need

<i>[Chorus]</i>

So, be my lover, be my friend
say this love will never end
want no other in my life
our forever starts tonight
All of my love
Oh yes

<i>[Chorus]</i>
