<i>[English Translation:]</i>

Do you remember me
Do you remember me?
Me, who used to be so small and young

When the white first snow fell on the entire world
I prayed every single night

Someday, Iâll spend Christmas Eve with you
I hope that day will definitely come

Snow is falling again today
But you are not by my side
Now please hold me
In your arms that is warm even in my imagination
This is my only Christmas wish

Any kind of heart, any kind of gift
Cannot take your place
I just want one thing â if only I have you,
Itâs enough, because I love you

Snow is falling again today
But you are not by my side
Now please hold me
In your arms that is warm even in my imagination
This is my only Christmas wish

How much more do I need to wait for you?
These faint foot steps, was it you?

Come to me, my hear
The white snow that blesses us is falling
Now please hold me
So I can fall asleep while being held in your embrace
You are my only Christmas wish
Only you alone are my-
My Christmas kiss goes toward you
