Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the 
Cure a lot.

<i>[Sung]</i>
You don't know how much I need you.
While you're near me I don't feel blue.
And when we kiss I know you need me too.
I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.

But it all was bullshit.
It was a goddamn joke.
And when I think of you Linda,
I hope you fucking choke.

I hope you're glad with what you've done to me.
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy.
You left me here all alone, tears running constantly.

Oh somebody kill me please,
somebody kill me plee-ase,
I'm on my knees,
pretty pretty please kill me.

I want to die.
Put a bullet in my head.

<i>[Girl:]</i> I liked it.
<i>[Guy:]</i> He's losing his mind... and I'm reaping all the benefits
