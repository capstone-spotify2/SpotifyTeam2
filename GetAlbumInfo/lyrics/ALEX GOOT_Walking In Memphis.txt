Put on my blue suede shoes and
I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Cause, I've got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
I'm walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the jungle room

I'm walking in Memphis
I'm walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
I'm walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
Got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
So they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
So I sang with all my might
She said, "Tell me are you a Christian?"
And I said, "Ma'am, I am tonight!"

I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
I'm walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
I'm walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
