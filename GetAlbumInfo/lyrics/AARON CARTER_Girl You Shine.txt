I see you every day
and I can't seem to think
of anything to say
Do you baby
How can that be
that it breaks my heart 
when you're smilin at me
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you Shine like that stars in the sky

In you I see something I won't find ever again
Baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true

<i>[REPEAT CHORUS]</i>

<i>[BRIDGE]</i>

Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're gonna make my dream come true
You know I never would leave you
I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart

Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl You shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me

<i>[REPEAT CHORUS]</i>

You're all I need to survive
and girl you keep me alive
and girl you shine like the sun in the sky
