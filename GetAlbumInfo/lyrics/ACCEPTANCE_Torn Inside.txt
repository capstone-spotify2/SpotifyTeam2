I can't speak, 
I'm lost for words, 
I can't hear, 
the silence burns 
a whole in
inside of me, 
that I can't fill for the life of me. 

I can't see, 
I'm blinded 
by the things you say to me are lies. 
I can't feel, 
feel you near, 
and that's because you were never here. 

What am I 
supposed to do? 
How am I 
supposed to feel? 
I put my 
my trust in you, 
but life can change. 

I can't see, 
I'm blinded 
by the things you say to me are lies. 
I can't feel, 
feel you near, 
and that's because you were never here.

You lied to me, you let me down, 
you turned this smile into a frown 
and now you're the only reason why, 
I find it hard to sleep at night. 

I'm feeling sad, I'm feeling blue, 
I think of the past times spent with you 
and now there's nothing left to say, 
so I just turn my head away.
