Another Day Has Come and Gone
They Fade Away Like Winter Sun
I Should Have Felt, What I Didn't See
I Should Have Known, That You Needed Me

But Now You're Here
My Heart Is Young, My Mind Is Clear
The Past Was Gone, When You Came To Me
You Were Always A Part Of My Destiny

I Always Believed, That This Day Had To Come
There Was Not Enough Time
And Too Much Left Undone
I Could Never Deny
Just How Far We Had Come

I've Got So Much Love
So Much Love
So Much Love
So Much Love

Another Day To Spend With You
That's All I Ask, Just To Be With You
And How I Feel, You Just Don't Know
And Now You're Here, I Won't Let You Go

I Always Believed, That This Day Had To Come
There Was Not Enough Time
And Too Much Left Undone
I Could Never Deny
Just How Far We Had Come

I've Got So Much Love
So Much Love
So Much Love
So Much Love
