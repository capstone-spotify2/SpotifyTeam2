I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord

I recall all the stories I've been told
I've read about heaven and its streets of gold
I'm prayin' and I'm wishin' ol' Saint Peter takes me fishin'
My bags are packed up and ready to roll

I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord

Yes, He paid the price for my admission
I've got my one-way ticket and that's a trip I won't be missin'
I've had a few reroutes and stops along the way, but His grace is gonna get me there someday

I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord

I'm gonna take that long vacation with the Lord
I'm gonna take that long vacation with the Lord
