I was lost deep in sin
Jesus came and took me in
Now I feel I've got a friend
I got a friend in him

Every time I feel the spirit
Moving in my heart, I pray
And it always make me say
Keep me day by day

He's so real to me
(God is so real)
So really real so, so really real
(God is so real)
So real, so real

So real to me
(God is so real)
He's so really real
So real to me

Every time I feel the spirit
Moving in my heart I pray
And it always make me say
