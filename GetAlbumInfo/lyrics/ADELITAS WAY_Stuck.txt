I gotta ask you to leave
I gotta ask you to piss
I see, something's missing
Guess I said it was love
I guess I said that I'm done
What's this, I've been feeling stuck
And I feeling like some other
Can't you smell the sun
Do you ever think to yourself

Baby, it's all messed up
And I don't like it
I'm the only one that's slipping away
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't wanna be the one that keeps on counting my days
I'm stuck
Baby, it's all messed up
And I don't like that I can see my second slipping away
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all that's stuck

Sticks before you can know you never saw what was wrong
I see, someone's listening
I guess I said it was love
I guess I said that I'm done
Wise words once said
Now I'm stuck
And I feel like another
Can't you smell that sun
And I'm feeling like you never

Cause maybe it's all that's stuck
And I don't like that
I'm the only one that's slipping away
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't wanna be the one that keeps on counting my days
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't like that I can see my second slipping away
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't wanna be the one that always gets in the way
I'm stuck
Baby, it's all messed up

I know it's all messed up
And I don't like it
I'm the only one that's slipping away
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't wanna be the one that keeps on counting my days
I'm stuck
Maybe it's all messed up
And I don't like that
I can see my second slipping away
I'm stuck
Baby, it's all messed up
And I don't wanna be the one that always gets in the way
I'm stuck
Baby, it's all messed up
And I don't like that
I can see my second slipping away
I'm stuck
I don't wanna be the one that keeps on counting my days
I'm stuck
