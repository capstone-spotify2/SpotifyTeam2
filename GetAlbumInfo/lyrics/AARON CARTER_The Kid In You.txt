Turn it up Pump it up 
Turn it up 
Just a little bit 

Turn it up 
Pump it up 
Turn it up 
Just a little bit 

All the kids gonna bounce to this 
All the kids gonna jump to this 
All the kids gonna snap to this 

Yo, rock it 

Little Aaron 

How many people understand me that this is why
I keep growin' up to go to school, and that's a fact 
Getting a job from the school, loan pay 'em back 
Then you get a car to make it to the job and back 
Can you tell me why things gotta be this way 

I'd rather be at the pool catchin' sunrays 
Guys in the deep end 
Girls in the shallow 
Kids in the middle shout "MARCO POLO!" 
When a get a little older Imma change things 

Makin' life go easy like ice cream 
Become president and play on the dream team 
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies 
But I guess right now Imma sit back 
While I watch Scooby-Doo eat a Scooby snack 
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack 
And do a little homework for my math class 

So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you 
Ha ha, ha ha 
Woah 

I be the one that be dropping the hits 
Lacing the beats 
Here to the streets 
Bringing the heat 
Copping the chicks 
Dropping yo mix 
Never forget what, what, what being a kid is 

Even though I got a lot of dough 
I keep it real 
I still play my Sega Dreamcast 
When I chill 
Nickelodeon on while I'm eatin' meals 
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal 
Listen up, to you kids all across the land 
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman 
Still watching re-runs of the X-Man 

And I still show love to my parents 
Do chores when I'm home from running errands 
Come to the crib, eat a ham sandwich 
And when I'm around ya, you know what
I'm wearing, Timberlands 

So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you 
Ha ha, ha ha 
Whoah

Yo, everyone wanna be stuck in there old ways 
Never wanna change when the get a certain age 
Not me AC, gonna be this way 
Stay this way, always say yo, yo 

So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you 

So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do you'll never lose 
The kid in you 
The kid in you 
The kid in you
