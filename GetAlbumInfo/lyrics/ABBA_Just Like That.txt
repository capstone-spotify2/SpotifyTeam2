Until that day
My life had been a river
Following the same, pre-destinated course,
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force.
My strongholds broke down all too easily;
I remember well,
How it did embarrass me;
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And once again, the river's flowing slowly,
Following its safe and uneventful course.
Now the tears have dried,
it's become a pleasant break,
I recall without remorse.
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit,
he had something that I miss.
I guess he was a rolling stone;
The only one I've known.

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat

Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
