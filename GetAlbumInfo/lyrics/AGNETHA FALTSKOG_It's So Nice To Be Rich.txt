It's so nice to be rich, rich, rich, rich...
Young, smart, handsome, and rich, rich, rich, rich...
To dress up in the mink again
And swim in the pink champagne,
Oh how I loathe old age, stupidity, and hunger,
I prefer to be full, cleverer, and younger,
Oh you old dumb bum in the ditch, snitch, snitch...
And get rich, rich, rich, rich...
Get rich, rich, rich, rich...

<i>[REPEAT]</i>

Mmm, get rich, rich, rich, rich...
