Here we are, once again
Stronger now than we have ever been
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Now we're made it through the hardest part

We had to break it all down
To build it back up
Lean on each other when the times got rough
How'd we survive going through so much
Baby you and me could write a book about love

Here we are, one to one
Looking back to see how far we've come

We've shared it all, you and I
Still together after all this time

We had to break it all down
To build it back up
Lean on each other when the times got rough
How'd we survive going through so much
Baby you and me could write a book about love

Here we are, once again
Stronger now than we have ever been
Hand in hand, heart to heart, here we are

Here we are, once again
Stronger now than we have ever been
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Now we've made it through the hardest part

Here we are, one to one
Looking back to see how far we've come

We've shared it all, you and I
Still together after all this time
Here we are
