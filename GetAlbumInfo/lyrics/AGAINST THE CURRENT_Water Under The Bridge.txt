If youâre not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If youâre not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if Iâm not the one for you
Youâve got to stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if Iâm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

Itâs so cold out here, in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently 
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Say that our love ainât water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ainât no life to live like youâre on the run
Have I ever asked for much? 
The only thing that Iâll want is your love

If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently 
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Say that our love ainât water under the bridge

Itâs so cold, here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently 
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
If youâre gonna let me down, let me down gently
Donât pretend that you donât want me
Our love ainât water under the bridge
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Say that our love ainât water under the bridge
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Say that our love ainât water under the bridge

Say that our love ainât water under the bridge
