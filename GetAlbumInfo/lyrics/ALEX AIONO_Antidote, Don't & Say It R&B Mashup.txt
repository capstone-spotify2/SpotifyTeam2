Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote baby
Poppin' pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know
Don't go through the front door
It's lowkey at the night show
Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote
Don't
Don't you let out that antidote
No don't play with it, don't be dishonest
Still not understanding this logic
I'm back and I'm better
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Somebody so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only did it to you 'cause you let him
Uh no he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killing the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up skirt
Get in the ride
Left hand is steering the other is gripping your thigh
You deserve what you been missing
You deserve what you been missing

You gon have to do more than just
You gon have to do less when you 
Little mama you know I 
Always want you to
You gon have to do more than just 
You gon have to do less when you 
Lil mama you know I 

Long brown hair and and some lips like Jenner
Type of the girl that would make you want to take it ..slow
Girl next door like the summer and the winter
Hotter then the sun but she colder then the snow
Golden like the trophies ill be holding down the road
Rolling like I rifa I don't even need to smoke
High when I'm with you 
Fixed on your soul
I just need to know 
You gon have to do more than just talk
You gon have to do less when you walk
Ooh girl I hate to see you leave
But I love to watch you go
They always come around when I'm up
But will you stick around when I'm low
Say you will and 
I really want to believe
But you still got to show
Don't you open up that window
Don't play with it, don't be dishonest
So let a young hitter get down on it
Yeah
Love when you spin around on it
Yeah
Don't you let out that antidote
