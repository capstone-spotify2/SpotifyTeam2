It's not what you thought
When you first began it
You got what you want
Now you can hardly stand it, though
By now you know
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up

You're sure there's a cure
And you have finally found it
You think one drink
Will shrink you till you're underground
And living down
But it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up

Prepare a list for what you need
Before you sign away the deed
'Cause it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up

No, it's not going to stop
Till you wise up
No, it's not going to stop
So just give up
