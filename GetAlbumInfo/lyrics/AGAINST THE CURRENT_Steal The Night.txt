We're gonna steal the night
Got no time to borrow
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
Alone tomorrow

Need a fix, need a change
When the days feel like they're daisy-chained together
Cause it all feels the same
When the knot in me just stretches on forever

Only got T minus 24 hours
Gonna make you mine, gonna make this ours

We're gonna steal the night
Got no time to borrow
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
I love tomorrow
We're gonna steal the night
Let our voices echo
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
Alone tomorrow

Live it here, live it now
Cause I don't want to waste another minute
Make a move, scream it out
Cause it's our world and they're just living in it

Only got T minus 24 hours
Gonna make you mine, gonna make this ours

We're gonna steal the night
Got no time to borrow
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
I love tomorrow
We're gonna steal the night
Let our voices echo
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
Alone tomorrow

Anything to break the pace
Find me dancing through the rain
Need a rush to fill the space
Adrenaline inside my veins

We're gonna steal the night
Got no time to borrow
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
I love tomorrow
We're gonna steal the night
Let our voices echo
We don't wanna wake up, wake up
Alone tomorrow
