Yeah I can see it coming.
I've seen it all before.
I've seen it once or twice
and now I hear it call to board.
This train is moving fast
but how long is it gonna last.
I guess that we'll find out
as well go in through the out door.
Don't, don't ever let go.
Don't, don't ever let go.
Is this the start?
Is this the end?
New faces ask, "what's happening?"
I bite my tongue and hold my breath
and tell them, "the same old thing."
I don't know what's going on,
but I don't wanna do it wrong.
Don't wanna contradict myself
with all the words I sing.
Don't, don't ever let go.
Don't, don't ever let go.
Let's go! Don't, don't ever let go.
Don't, don't ever let go.
Don't ever let go.
Don't ever let go.
