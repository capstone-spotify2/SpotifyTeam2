And Iâd give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that youâd feel me somehow
Youâre the closest to Heaven that Iâll ever be
And I donât want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later itâs over
I just donât want to miss you tonight!

And I donât want the world to see me
Cause I donât think that theyâd understand
When everythingâs meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am!

And you canât fight the tears that ainât coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know youâre alive.

And I donât want the world to see me
Cause I donât think that theyâd understand
When everythingâs meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am!
Who I am!

And I donât want the world to see me
Cause I donât think that theyâd understand
When everythingâs meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
