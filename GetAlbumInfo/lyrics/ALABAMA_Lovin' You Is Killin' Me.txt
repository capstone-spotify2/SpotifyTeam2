You go out on the town feelin' alright
Leavin' me here alone you're stayin' all night
You're good to me, do something sweet
Tonight you're back out on the street
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.

You're good to me, do something sweet
Tonight you're back out on the street
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.

I don't blame you for havin' fun
As long as I'm your only one.

So go on out, have a time, have a good time
Don't forget, if he asks you're still mine
Don't let our love fall apart
'Cause if you do you'll break my heart
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.

Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.
