I've been walking on a tight rope
Ever since I made up my mind
And I'm swaying with the wind
From my left to my right
Everyone's pretending
They don't wanna see me fall
But I never let 'em touch me at all

Sometimes I get weary
All alone in a faceless crowd
They can't hear me
When I cry out loud

I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world
I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world

I've been staring out my window
Ever since it started to rain
And the raindrops look like teardrops
On my windowpane

I'm so tired of waiting, waiting
For the sun to come around
Gonna button up my coat
And head downtown

Sometimes I get weary
All alone in a faceless crowd
They can't hear me
When I cry out loud

Sometimes I get weary
All alone in a faceless crowd
They can't hear me
When I cry out loud

I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world
I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world

Sometimes I get weary
All alone in a faceless crowd
They cant hear me
When I cry out loud

Sometimes I get weary
All alone in a faceless crowd
They can't hear me
When I cry out loud

I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world
I'm searching for a superfine love
In a lonely world
