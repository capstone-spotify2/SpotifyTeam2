I'm on my way,
And I'm movin' top speed.
Ain't no lookin' back,
so don't even wave to me.
I'm goin' for a time to chase what I believe.
In other words I'm following my dreams.
So many set they mind to do the same,
Even if it seems a little strange.
(They still do it)
Take my advice, that there's more in life to gain,
If you just willin' to fight through the pain.
(and keep kickin'!)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Can't nobody change me,
Or what I believe.
So I'm here to make it and 
need to go out and achieve.
Outdone by no one,
New life's test run.
Thought my time was up,
But the journey had just begun.

Can't nobody change me,
Or what I believe.
So I'm here to make it and 
need to go out and achieve.
Outdone by God's Son,
New life's test run.
Thought my time was up,
But the journey had just begun.

This life we live,
the struggles we face.
the path we're on,
The moves we make.
At any time can all be replaced,
Like a memory in your head just being erased.
So I'll move on,
just to keep the lead.
And make sure that
nobody gets in front of me.
(look out)
It's like I can't stop now,
The power that I feel
when I'm hearin' the crowd.
(Juggalo!) 
It's just so addicting,
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
the love that you get,
with no sight of friction.
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
will keep you moving,
til you're all worn out.
That's the type of feelin' 
that I'm talkin' about!

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I got the secret and it changed my mentality,
Now I'm pushing all my energy into the galaxy.
Like a Jager Bomb, gives you personality,
I'm on my way, so don't try to come after me.
(get out my way!)
Advertise every time they criticize,
Instead of looking deep into what's real in our eyes.
So, realize...
Some look at us as a joke,
and get upset 'cause they got choked,
when they tried to provoke.

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
