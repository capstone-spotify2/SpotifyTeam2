I'm clumsy, yeah my head's a mess
'Cause you got me growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall
Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall

I'll be careful, so don't be afraid
You're safe here, no, these arms won't let you break
I'll put up a sign in the clouds
So they all know that we ain't ever coming down

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall
Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall

You build me up
Make me what I never was
You build me up
From nothing into something
Yeah, something from the dust

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall
Oh, oh, oh
I'm ten feet tall
