when you and i first began
we always gave each other a hand
never did i expect to see
that all our love would fade away

i need time to pick up all the bits and pieces
of these broken dreams

tell me what i'm going through
lets get away for a day or two
send some money - send some fame
without you  it won't be the same

i need time to pick up all the bits and pieces
of these broken dreams

well i guess that you might say
that we've come a long long way
but i say it's too soon to tell
if our scheme will win or fail
so get the toolbox out
it's time to find a way
to fix these broken dreams

i need time to find a way
a way to fix these broken dreams
tell me what i'm going through
i just can't shake these broken dreams
take these shattered bits and pieces
of these scattered broken dreams
get the toolbox out
because it's time to fix these broken dreams
