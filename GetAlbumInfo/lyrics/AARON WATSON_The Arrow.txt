I've been heartbroke and broke down 
Hard up and hard fought 
Misunderstood, misguided 
And I've missed by a long shot 
I understand first hand
I've been where you've been, 
Don't you forget 
Every sunset will become a sunrise soon again 

So be bold and be brave 
And beware of those schemes,
Stay razor sharp, find your mark 
As you go chase your dreams,
Watch out for those dangers 
Always dancing in the dark, 
When the shadows of the night shoot out the lights, I know you'll be the spark 

So promise me before you go 
follow your arrow, 
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow, 
Be steadfast and steady, 
always be ready, 
Aim for the stars in the sky, 
take heart, pull it back and let it fly 

Good things come to those who pray so don't you chalk it up a chance, 
And never let your arrow be led by arrogance,
Fill your quiver full of courage,
Show this world your heaven sent 
Keep a good head on your shoulders 
Every arrow needs a fine piece flint 

So promise me before you go 
follow your arrow, 
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow, 
Be steadfast and steady, 
always be ready, 
Aim for the stars in the sky, 
take heart, pull it back and let it fly on the wings of an angel,
Let it fly with the grace of a dove, 
Through the lightning and thunder 
Never aimlessly wonder 
Let it fly with kindness and love, 
Let it fly with kindness and love 

Let it fly
Let it fly

Promise me before you go 
follow your arrow, 
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow, 
Be steadfast and steady, 
always be ready, 
Aim for the stars in the sky, 
take heart, pull it back and
Promise me before you go 
follow your arrow, 
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow, 
Be steadfast and steady, 
always be ready, 
Aim for the stars in the sky, 
take heart, pull it back and let it fly

So stand firm in your faith
as you raise up your bow,
Fear not the dragon,
You are the arrow
