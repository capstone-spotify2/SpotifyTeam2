Ya see it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
Boss man tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Now I'm the kinda guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't ever carry a gun
I ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
