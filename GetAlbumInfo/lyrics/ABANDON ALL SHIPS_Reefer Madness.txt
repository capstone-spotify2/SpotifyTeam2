Your life is a lie
everything they told you
open your eyes
look at your life
you're just waiting to die

you're fucking meaningless
you lost your soul
the path you're on is not your own
you're living a lie

with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness

karma is a bitch
and it is coming to collect
save your fucking souls
there is no time to repent
i've never felt more alone
i made peace with my demons
who call me their home
pray for release
i know it haunts you inside
free me from the voices that trap me in my mind

with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness

if the path you're on is not your own
remember not to go down it alone
you're living a lie

with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness
