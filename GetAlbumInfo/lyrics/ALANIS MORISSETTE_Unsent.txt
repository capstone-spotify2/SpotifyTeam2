dear matthew I like you a lot I realize you're in a relationship 
with someone right now and I respect
that I would like you to know that if you're ever single 
in the future and you want to come visit me in california 
I would be open to spending time with you and finding 
out how old you were when you wrote your first song 

dear jonathan I liked you too much I used to be attracted to boys 
who would lie to me and think solely about themselves and you 
were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time I used to say 
the more tragic the better the truth is whenever I think of the early 90's 
your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday 

dear terrance I love you muchly you've been nothing 
but open hearted and emotionally available and supportive 
and nurturing and consummately there for me I kept drawing you in 
and pushing you away I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep 
on your couch and cry in front of you for the first time you 
were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself what 
was wrong with me 

dear marcus you rocked my world you had a charismatic way 
about you with the women and you got me
seriously thinking about spirituality and you wouldn't let me get away 
with kicking my own ass but I could never really feel relaxed and looked out 
for around you though and that stopped us from going any further 
than we did and it's kinda too bad becasue we could've had much more fun 

dear lou we learned so much I realize we won't be able to talk for some time 
and I understand that as I do you
the long distance thing was the hardest and we did as well as we could 
we were together during a very tumultuous time
in our lives I will always have your back and be curious about you 
about your career about your whereabouts
