Someone in this room is the right one for me 
But how can it be that I cannot see 
Iâm biding my time 
While drinking my wine 
oh-wah-oh

Iâm gonna be free this weekend, so free. 
Iâm showing off my liberty 
Get ready to play 
You making my day 
Iâm finding a way

But when the night time is all over Iâm all alone 
Iâm advancing and Iâm dancing with myself

<i>[Chorus]</i>
A vision in blue 
Forever young 
A token so true 
My Koh Phangan <i>[4x]</i>
I see you dancing in front of my face 
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase 
Iâm flashing for you 
A bright light in the night (for you)

Iâm gonna be me, myself and I 
Losing the rhythm thatâs my goodbye 
Iâm feeling the heat 
Complete with the beat 
Iâm playing discreet

But when the night time is all over Iâm all alone 
Iâm advancing and Iâm dancing with myself

<i>[Chorus]</i>

A vision in blue <i>[repeated and ad-libbed]</i>

<i>[Chorus (with ad-libs):]</i>

A vision in blue 
A vision in blue
