Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in a city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this is gonna be the good life
This is gonna be the good life
This could really be a good life
Good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like the city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York
I say hello
My friends in L.A.
They don't know

Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometime there's airplanes that can't jump out
Sometimes there's things that just don't work out

We are gods of stories
But please tell me
What good is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Oh, this is gonna be the good life
This is gonna be the good life
This could really be a good life
A good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like the city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

A good, good life

To my friends in New York
I say hello
My friends in L.A.
They don't know

Where I've been for the past few years of so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes that can't jump out
Sometimes there's things that just don't work out

We are gods of stories
But please tell me
What there is to complain about
