One time for your mind

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
He with the homies, he with the homies
No squares in his circle, nobody phonie
He with the homies, he with the homies
We don't love them hoes, let's get this money
He got a main chick, been with her for a while
Love making, and making out
His fellas in his ear, "you acting like a queer"
You going on dates, we tryna get this cake
The pressure be setting in
If you a real man, you would fuck her friend
Head saying no, other one saying yes
His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous
Unfasten her clothes, is what you gonna tell his soul
The thrill of it all got him off, case closed
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
She with the girls, she with the girls
Hair done, nails done, no care in the world
She with the girls, she with the girls
They all wifey material, yes sir
She want a boyfriend, she been missing out
On love making and making out
But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter
Unbutton his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
See the moral of the story is
She a ho, he a pimp
Old girl'll forgive her man
But her girlfriend's cut off like Edward's hands
What's fucked up is he got at her
Bitches call her a rat, but shit she's heard worse
To my niggas having bitches, it's what you just do
To the bitches having niggas, this what a slut do
My auntie told me always treat my lady right
My uncle told me only love 'em for a night
You can see the immediate disconnection
Between a man and a woman, the reason for aggression
For example, you heard of Amber Cole
But you don't know that nigga that was getting dome
I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole
But we don't know that lil' nigga that was getting dome

It's just my interpretation of the situation
