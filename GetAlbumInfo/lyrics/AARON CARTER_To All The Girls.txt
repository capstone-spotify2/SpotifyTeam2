Let me break it down

I remember sunny days
Chillin' on the beach
And catchin' rays
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do

Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you when it's like that

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down with me
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
