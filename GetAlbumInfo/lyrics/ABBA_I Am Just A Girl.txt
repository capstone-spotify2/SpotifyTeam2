I am just a girl, one among the others, nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl, not a special type in any way
Just one look, and you will surely see
That the true "Miss Nobody" is me
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl

It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl

La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la la la laaa
La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la laaa
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl
