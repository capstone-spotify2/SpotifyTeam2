Loves been so nice
Loves been so right
Loves been so nice
Loves been so right

I've been in love many times before
But never has my love ever been so sure
Girl I'm so glad, that you could care
So much for me
The girl is so bad, I can't believe
She belongs to me

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

I've been waiting for your love
But love has been over due
Well never did I dream girl
I'd find love so true
Girl I'm so glad, that I found you
you turn my grey skies blue
Girl I'm so glad, I can be with you
You are my dream come true

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

And I want you girl
And I need you darlin
And I want
And I need
Got to have your love

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right

Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right
