I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
With you in my life, there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (to be with you)
Hoping you want me the way that I want to be with you

Deep inside I know you care,baby for me, you really care
I felt it the first day you came my way
So beautiful, and here we are, baby like the moon and the stars
Together never one without the other

My emotions are in your hands, cause you're my man baby
So take care of me, and I'll understand, that you need a friend
So don't ever worry, don't ever doubt, cause you're all I'm about

I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
With you in my life there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (hoping you want me)
Hoping you want me, the way that I want to be with you

Baby, baby let it be, let your love overpower me
Take me to a place that I've never been, never been before
Somehow this love is out of control
I'm falling for you and I don't want to go
I don't want to go, no, no

Baby I'll go
Don't let me go

My emotions are in your hands
Girl I want to be your man
I'll take care of you, I'll understand
I understand that you're my friend
No, no need to worry
Don't you ever doubt, cause you're my friend
I love you too
