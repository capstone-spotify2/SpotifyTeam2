Those nights we walk together
I couldn't sleep
Well I still remember what you wore now
It was the cold december air
the way the rain hit your hair but then
I woke up from a dream I can't repair
and then realized 
how far I'd finally come
Well the damage that's been made
The hurt I've caused can never be erased
only until now
can we disappear
Now

I walked alone some nights
thinking of the time 
we laid your soul to rest
This disillusion comforts me
I wait for you sometimes 
but always feel my life
is flashing way to fast
We never had a second chance
So when was my place branded 
faithless lost again
So when was my place branded 
faithless lost my friend

I will never trust and
label death as my only defense
I will never trust again
I will never trust and
label death as my only defense
I will never love again
I still remember when your

You were found
and we were bored 
let's live 
one more time

I've made my way this life's
taken so much time to manufacture grace
I feel the darkness fall
I can remember times when so much 
Love and hate made something more than
Haste
It made me push you more
So when are we supposed to leave this place
Why you not me
So when were we supposed to climb on top of grace
From your cold hands 
and your dead eyes
From your cold
Hands I Cry

I will never trust and
label death as my only defense
I will never trust again
I will never trust and
label death as my only defense
I will never love again
I will never trust and
label death as my only defense
I will never love again
I still remember that cold december
