Cold lonely water
I wait, wait for you
I'm caught in this past fallen
Everything I had Iâve broken now
Oh how I feel unwell parts of me I canât sell
(I wonder why)
But Iâll wait

Throw me a line
Give me some rope which I can hang with
Give me a sign youâve been stole with a poacherâs time
Give me a line
Give me some rope which I can hang with
Give me a sign youâve been stole with a poacherâs time

Lost and now Iâm losing
I tried to stop but I'm confusing time
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why, I wonder why

Take my eyes, you can shut my ears, my heart is blind
Thereâs a thousand fears behind your lies the dark canât hide
Cold lonely water
Iâll wait 
So throw me a line 
Give me some rope which I can hang with
Give me a sign youâve been stole with a poacherâs time
Throw me a line
Give me some rope which I can hang with
Give me a sign youâve been stole with a poacherâs time

Cold lonely water
I wait, wait for you
Cold lonely water
I wait, I wait, I wait
