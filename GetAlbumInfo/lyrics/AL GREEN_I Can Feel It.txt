I was just a little boy
Why, my momma said to me
Son, you want to grow up strong
You gotta know what you believe
You're gonna find out one day
There's only two ways you can go
And when you get down
To the end of the line
There's somebody you need to know
She was telling me all about Jesus
And how He died to set me free
He arose from the dead
For a Memphis boy like me

I can feel it
From the sole of my feet
To the crown of my head
I felt it from the day I was born
I know my God ain't dead
He wakes me up early in the morning
And keeps me late at night
Choose to run away from the darkness
And start to walk in the light

He's the Alpha and Omega
He's the beginning and the end
He's the only one of the people
That I can really
Really call a friend
He's the first and the last
Ah you know the Word is true
If you want anything from my Lord
You know what you've got to do

She was telling me all about Jesus
And how He died to set me free
He arose from the dead
For a Memphis boy like me

I can feel if from the crown of my head
To the sole of my feet
How He threw up both of His hands
For the people that believe

It wasn't done in a corner
But high up on a hill
You gotta give it all you've got
People you know the deal

I can feel it from the crown of my head
To the sole of my feet
I have felt it from the day I was born
I know my God ain't dead
He wakes me up early in the morning
And keeps me late at night
