All your pretty bags are packed
Forever sure did go by fas
I hope you find the skies are blue
The grass is green and the road is smooth

<i>[Chorus]</i>
You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love Dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy

I poured some bourbon in a coffee cup
it's been too long since I drank too much
so here's to me and here's to the moon
And here's to love that ends too soon

<i>[Chorus]</i>
You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love Dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy

Yeah it ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
you go your way and I'll go crazy
I'll go crazy
