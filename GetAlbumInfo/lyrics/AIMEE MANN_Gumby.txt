Gumby, I just canât do anything,
canât do anything right
donât ask me
if Iâll help when helping you
just means someone to fight

Itâs so hard putting on your clothes
you donât even move to cover your skin
why move, moving is how things begin
the front yard taken by the crows
blackguards with their shiny pieces of tin
so much fury
you bury it in

Gumby, we should call your daughter
please, call your daughter again
you must see
things are getting harder and
getting more out of hand

Dude, youâre not even that old
how bad must it be to be bad as this
all day, filling a bottomless pit
all these trinkets bought and sold
all tokens youâve thrown down to the abyss
thereâs a bottom that youâll never hit

And I donât know just how you explain this
to a kid with nowhere to live
tell her that the father she has means well
but just has nothing to give

Gumbyâ¦
you should call your daughter again
donât call meâ¦
call your daughter.
