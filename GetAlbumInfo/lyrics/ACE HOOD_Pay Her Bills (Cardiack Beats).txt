Okay

Ass in the air keep your face down
And ima pat your body this a shake down
Redbone, hair long tatted up
Love to ride a nigga tell her saddle up
Money in my pockets, in the fitted jeans
Ciroc and sprite I mix it with a lemon squeeze
Jump out the Phantom this was once a dream
All this ice around me tryna dodge a breeze
I'm cold as hell, nigga aw I mean the slow
Got them bitches throwin pussy soon I hit the door
They like hello Mr. Hood we been waitin on ya
And fuck these lame niggas we been hatin on ya
that's cause I'm getting too much money mind ya business
You think it's sweet then I'll throw seven to ya kidneys
Brand new grill on the mirror, fuck the dentist
Never mind them haters, I just want you all to witness

Shawty pop that pussy on the headstand
Like my women, I come with a girlfriend
She won't do the honors then another will
See, a baller do whatever for them dollar bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
Fuck it, I just do it to enjoy the thrills

Tall heels and your clothes done evaporated
Ima call the shots and you just demonstrate it
Gon pop that pussy like you know the deal
40 K in ones bitch I'm payin bills
Fuck them other niggas they irrelevant
That whip I got outside screamin arrogance
Walk up in the club middle finger high
Swag killin niggas call it suicide
Niggas try me they gon wear a suit and tie
Make them killas turn you into apple pie
Black young nigga with a .38
Sit in that Mercedes, that's expensive taste
Hoppin up out that bitch, I got my Rolee on
Crack rock diamonds, I'm a rolling stone
Fuck you and your friends, what my homies on
But first I need you to listen to my favorite song

Shawty pop that pussy on the headstand
Like my women, I come with a girlfriend
She won't do the honors then another will
See, a baller do whatever for them dollar bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
She gon buss it open, I'm gon pay her bills
Fuck it, I just do it to enjoy the thrill
