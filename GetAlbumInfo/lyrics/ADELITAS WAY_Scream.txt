Light the gasoline
I've got the rememdy
To burn your memories
I don't know if it can
Never be afraid
To live with the lies and pain
You're never gonna be the same
I don't know if you can
I wanna take it too far
Come on don't be shy
I wanna make you go down down

I can make you scream
How I live my life when I have no choice
I see it in your eyes you're crazy
Just scream
How it feels inside
Let me hear your voice
And make it loud this time it opens up my mind

Tell me what you see
I'm not your enemy
If that's what you wanna be
I don't know if I can
When you scream my name
And I take all the blame
It's never gonna be the same
I don't know if you care
I wanna take it too far come on don't be shy
I wanna make you go down down

I can make you scream
How I live my life when I have no choice
I see it in your eyes you're crazy
Just scream
How it feels inside
Let me hear your voice
And make it loud this time it opens up my mind

When you scream
Maybe you're in denial
It kills me I can see it it's on your face
I can't see
Now we're breaking the silence
When you scream
Let it go and you take it away

I can make you scream
How I live my life when I have no choice
I see it in your eyes you're crazy
Just scream
How it feels inside
Let me hear your voice
And make it loud this time it opens up my mind

Maybe you're in denial
I can make you scream
I can see it it's on your face
When you scream
Now we're breaking the silence
I can make you scream
Let it go and you take it away
