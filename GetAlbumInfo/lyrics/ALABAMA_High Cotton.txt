We didn't know that times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Chopin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had.

As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt - the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.

When Sunday mornings rolled around
We dressed up in hand-me downs
Just in time, to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long it's been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

We were walkin' in high cotton.
