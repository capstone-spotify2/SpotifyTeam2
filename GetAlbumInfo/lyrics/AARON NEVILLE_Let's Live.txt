Why torture yourself, when you know you're in love
Throw your pride in the ocean and be happy beneath the stars above
Confess your feelings to the one's you love
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live

Why deprive yourself, of the wonders of life
Time is getting shorter, there's no reason for those lonely nights
If you don't, if you don't love me, you'll miss the boat
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live

Why should you live in a sad state of mind
Problems, problems, problems all the time
Do your best to get them off your chest
Everything, everything will be just fine

Love is nice , love is sometimes cruel
When you've been in love you have been to the greatest school
So try and make an "a" honey, and I'll do the same
Let's live, before it's too late
Let's live, before it's too late
You know, I know, before it's too late
So, come on, come on, come on
Let's live
