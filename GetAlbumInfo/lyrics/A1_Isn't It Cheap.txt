This punky clubwas spinning fores off a funky tee
I'm on the floor and she's watching me
Guess she was fine with a head to thigh inspection
With my back against the wall I play it casually
Man, I don't know but when she smiled at me
And started grinding her arse on the horn of some dirty trumpet
I had to say something

Camera shy, no style, getting it right I said I wanna take you home, tonight.
And she said

*Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture.
Love me if you like, but I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free. Isn't it cheap

As soon as she got me alone there was no(huh) hesitation
And she started taking off all her clothes to Lady Paris singing
I was jacking her up all night with a lethal injection
The way she alomost put up a fight, was so close to perfection

Tired eyes, no ties, turn on the light I want to see what gets you hot, tonight.
And she said

<i>[Repeat*]</i>

isn't it cheap, when I'm down on my knees.
Talking sweet just to meet your demands. See your
delight as your stealing my night
Just to play it straight in to my hands
