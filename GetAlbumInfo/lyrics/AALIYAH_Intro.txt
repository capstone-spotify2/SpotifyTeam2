Listen to instructions carefully
While bumpin' this album in your jeeps
Aaliyah's got a ninety's swing
So be careful with
The volume please
Yeah
Hmm

So if you're down with the funky flavor
Throw your hands up
An' if you got the fever for Aaliyah
Throw your hands up
An' if you're down with black ground
Throw your hands up
An' if you got soul
Let me see your hands up
If you got bass in your jeep
Throw your hands up
An' if your not down with the crack
Throw your hands up
An' if you think your hype enough to swing it
Throw your hands up
An' if you down with the second chapter
Throw your hands up
