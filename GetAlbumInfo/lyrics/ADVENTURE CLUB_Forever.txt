I built myself out of these walls they're all I had to work with
I'm a dream cut of stone one can't be one can't feel
Some things you'll never know, but you dive anyway
Into darker shades are you afraid, you don't have to be

We could go, we just stole it 
We could fall like a star we're burnin' up
The fire's all we got
And we go on forever
Thrown into the wave
They say that time don't matter
With you it feels that way
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on...

Like the setting sun gently shining all over you
Running parallel with a sea so deep and blue
Sometimes my heart beats slow like I'm miles away
In a dark place are you afraid, you don't have to be

We could go, we just stole it 
We could fall like a star we're burnin' up
This ain't all we got
But we go on forever
Thrown into the wave
They say that time don't matter
With you it feels that way
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on forever and ever
We go on...
