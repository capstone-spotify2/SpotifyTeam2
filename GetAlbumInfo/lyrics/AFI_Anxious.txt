Tear into silence, my ears begin to ring
Begin to ring in the new sound anxiously
Oh, I am anxious and aching, breathing the burning air
Caring for something that is not there

Knowing what's fated, begin my fatal flight
Flying obscenely into the light
But the light will evade me to bring down punishment
Punishing soundly it lets me live

Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become

Black without blindness, my eyes begin to sting
As my lips part to poison, sweet poisoning
Oh god, I feel like I'm dying. I've found death finally
And it feels like heaven, I'll never reach

Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become

Swinging now, will you watch me?
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Turn it down. Drown it slowly
Is it off? I'm still listening
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Swinging now, will you watch me?
Turn it down. Drown it slowly
Is it off? I'm still listening

Swing the serenade (I heard it swing)
Swing love down and find the saddest song
I heard you swing the promises (You'll watch me swing now)
Swing love now and choke what we've become

(I'll bite your lips though I know better than this)
(This is a death I cant resist)
