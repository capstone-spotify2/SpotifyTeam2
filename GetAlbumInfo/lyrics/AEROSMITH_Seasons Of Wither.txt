blues hearted lady, sleepy was she 
love for the devil brought her to me 
tears of a thousand drawn to her sin 
seasons of wither holdin' me in 
oooh woe is me, I feel so badly for you 
oooh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time 
bound to lose your mind 
live on borrowed time 
take the wind right out of your sail 
fireflies dance in the heat of 
hound dogs that bay at the moon 
my ship leaves in the midnight 
can't say I'll be back too soon 
they awaken, far far away 
heat of my candle show me the way 
tears of a thousand drawn to her sin 
seasons of wither holdin' me in
