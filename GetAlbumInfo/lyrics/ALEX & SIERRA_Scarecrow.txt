<i>[Alex:]</i>
I'm standin' still without you
In the emptiest of fields
I wish that I could say what's on my mind

<i>[Sierra:]</i>
The straw that fills your heart
So you never have to feel
You say that you just need a little time

<i>[Alex:]</i>
Days like these I bury my
My each and every word
And hide them underneath these lonely trees

<i>[Sierra:]</i>
The harvest moon is wicked
I know that you've been hurt
I swear I'm here for good I'll never leave

<i>[Alex:]</i>
This is where it starts tonight
<i>[Sierra:]</i>
If you open up your heart tonight

<i>[Both:]</i>
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

<i>[Sierra:]</i>
You used to be so full of life
Not just an empty shell
You're out there all alone I wonder why

<i>[Alex:]</i>
The pieces keep on falling out
And I pick them up myself
But I'd let you steal the buttons from my eyes

<i>[Alex:]</i>
Oh, this is where it starts tonight
<i>[Sierra:]</i>
If you open up your heart tonight

<i>[Both:]</i>
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)
(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

<i>[Sierra:]</i>
You said you'd open up for me
<i>[Alex:]</i>
Well nothing's what it seems to be
<i>[Sierra:]</i>
How can I make you feel again
<i>[Alex:]</i>
Only you can make me real again

<i>[Both:]</i>
You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

<i>[Both:]</i>
You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

<i>[Both:]</i>
You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I just want to believe in you and me
