Sitting here and drinking hey that's my favorite song
What's that, that I hear ringing would someone get the phone
Wondering if she'll ever come home
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned

Our love a fading memory as I chase another down
My eyes are getting heavy and my head's spinning 'round
Still wondering if she'll ever come home
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned

Closing time, I try for home not feeling any pain
Thoughts of her drift back to me through the falling rain
Not caring if she ever comes home
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned

I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned

Our love a fading memory as I chase another down
My eyes are getting heavy and my head's spinning 'round
Still wondering if she'll ever come home
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned...
