<i>[Christian:]</i>
I'm gonna take this chance to be up all night
I wanna fix this up just the way you like
I wanna shake the weight of the world, that's right
I gotta make the most of this old street light

And if you think I'm talking too much just tell me
If you need to change the pace then help me
We've got ten more minutes to go
I said, we've got ten more minutes before we go

<i>[Mark: (Ref)]</i>
There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
I heard it on the radio
So I'll take you home

<i>[Ben:]</i>
You know I need somebody to love me yes
You know that I wonât settle for second best
We gotta live like that ignore the rest
So if they all go east, then we'll go west
You know I dance my life to a different beat
And I like it here on the edge my seat
And now the stage is set, and we're alone
Where we end up later, we donât know

<i>[Ref]</i>

I take you home
Well, I take you home

And if it gets to crowded then may I suggest
That when they all go east then we'll go west
C'mon lets go, go, go
And where we end up, we dont know!

There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
And I heard it on the radio'
