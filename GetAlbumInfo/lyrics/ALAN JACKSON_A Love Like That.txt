Well I've been wonderin' what I've been missin'
I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it ain't whisperin'
It tells me just what it wants

Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my ol' hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that

I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that

Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I keep patchin' that ol' flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that

Yeah, I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that

Two young people dancin' in the daylight 
They don't care where they're at
Waitin' on sunset holdin' on so tight
I need a love like that

Yeah, I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that

One little baby hidin' in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Lovin' and trustin' blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that

Yeah, I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway a train needs a track
And I need a love like that

Yeah, a truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that...
