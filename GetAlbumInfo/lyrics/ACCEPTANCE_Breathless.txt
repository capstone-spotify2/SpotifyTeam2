Watch her go, watch her go, watch her go
She'll have to cut it away to save her life
And she knows, see she knows
It's like a fatal disease
You'll hear her cry, Oh
Take this
Make it something beautiful again
Make this
Make this happen cause you're beautiful to them

Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
No, let's go again
You tell me when
And I'll be taking over

And you know that I'll never (I will do it again)
Do it again (I'll take it away from you)
And I'll tell you I love you (I'll take it again)
(Just give me the chance, I'll take it again)
(I'll take it away from you)
Say it again

Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
No, let's go again
You tell me when
And I'll be taking over

And time stands still
Inside a picture
(I think of every word you say)
And time moves on to the next one
(I think of every word you said)
With every word you said

Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
No, let's go again
You tell me when
And I'll be taking over
