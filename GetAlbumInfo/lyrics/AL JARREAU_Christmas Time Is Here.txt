Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing

Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all, that's what children call
Their favorite time of the year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere, everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
Friends are drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
These spirit through the year

Sleigh bells in, in the air
There's beauty everywhere, everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing

Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing

Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing

Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing

Jingling, the bells ring
Jingling, the children sing
