Your love is just for me, for me, it's just for me
It's just for me for me for me it's just for me

Just stopped by to say that I love you more each day
When you turn around and you knock me down but I love you still

Why can'tchoo tell that I love you by the way that I smile.
Why can'tchoo bring more love to the table you drive me wild.

Your love is just for me, for me I can tell oh for nobody but me yeah
Your love for me, it's for me, I can tell its just for me.

Just stopped by to say we make a love worth living
And by now I think our love is more its more than giving hey hey

Why can'tchoo tell that I love you by the way that I smile.
Why can'tchoo bring more love to the table you drive me wild.

Your love is just for me for oh for nobody but me
Your love for me, it's for me I can tell its just for me

Thinking about you everyday this way
Thinking about you what can I say
Thinking about you takes more from me
Ahhhhhhhhh

Your love is just for me, for me it's just for me
Your love is for me, it's for me, for me I can tell its just for me
