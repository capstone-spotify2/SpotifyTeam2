Wish I could keep you much longer 
I know you gotta go cuz you got things to do 
Wish I could keep you much longer 
Now you to busy for me girl like I was to you 

Wish I could stop by 
And maybe say hi 
Wish I could jus stop by 
And lay by your side 

The tables have turned 
And I've finally learned 
That this is makin up for every day I was gone 
And that's why I'm concerned 
But now it's confirmed 
That you spread your wings and learned to fly all alone 

Darkness in the night 
I'll find that light for you 
As long as I got eyes 
I'll have a sight for you 
Long as I am alive baby I'd die for you 
I wanna be with you 

Wish I could keep you much longer 
I know you gotta go cuz you got things to do 
Wish I could keep you much longer 
Now you to busy for me girl like I was to you 

Wish I could stop by 
And maybe say hi 
Wish I could jus stop by 
And lay by your side 

You're always on my mind 
While I'm racin 
While I'm paper chasin 
You were there when I said one day I'd get up out that basement 
Playin as my agent 
For you, there's no replacement 
You will always be my girl 
And you can hold me on that statement 

Darkness in the night 
I'll find that light for you 
As long as I got eyes 
I'll have a sight for you 
Long as I am alive baby I'd die for you 
Wanna be with you 

Wish I could keep you much longer 
I know you gotta go cuz you got things to do 
Wish I could keep you much longer 
Now you to busy for me girl like I was to you 

Wish I could stop by 
And maybe say hi 
Wish I could jus stop by 
And lay by your side 

Baby I know you 
And how we do 
Doin exactly what I taught you 
Gotta get that money first
Before you come spend that precious time with your boo 
And I know I gotta just take it 
Even though it's drivin me crazy 
Always wanted to see my girl make it 

Wish I could keep you much longer 
I know you gotta go cuz you got things to do 
Wish I could keep you much longer 
Now you to busy for me girl like I was to you 

Wish I could keep you so much longer 

Wish I could stop by 
And maybe say "hi" 
Wish I could jus stop by 
And lay by your side 

Wish I could keep you much longer 
I know you gotta go cuz you got things to do 
Wish I could keep you much longer 
Now you to busy for me girl like I was to you 

Wish I could keep you baby 
I just wanna keep you longer
