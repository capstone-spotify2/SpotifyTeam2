You will, be missed, by all your fans
I clenched, my fists, but this' so heard to withstand
If I had the power to change one thing,
I'd bring you back today
but life's not promised and that won't change I'm a meet you there some day

In this life time I wanna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror
In this life time I wanna thank you, you motivated the whole world to deliver
We cry out of joy <i>[X8]</i>

There's so much joy in our heart oh I wish, the word could see you the way I did
And I wish, they witnessed how a wonderful dad you were kids
and I noticed it didn't stop there, saving children was one of your goals
Just domaiting all of your millions, so they could one day rule the world

In this life time I wanna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror
I this life time I wanna thank you to motivated the world to deliver
We cry out of joy <i>[X8]</i>

There's so much joy in our heart
One word for the media, please help the people see the love
Stop this garbage you're feeding us, show him for what he really was
remember there was more to come,
remember he's the chosen one,
remember he's the wisest one,
remember him for what is done,
remember him for what is done,
remember him for what is done,

In this life time I wanna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror
In this life time I wanna thank you for motivated world to delivered
We cry out of joy <i>[X8]</i>

Rest in peace and harmony, Michael.
I Love You, Man.
