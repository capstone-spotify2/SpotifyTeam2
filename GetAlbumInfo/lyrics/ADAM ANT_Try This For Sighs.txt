I call round your house
I try on your phone but you cry
Leave me alone leave me alone
I like your face you dig my eyes
Come on now honey try this for sighs
And if a push comes to a shove
And we have to call it love then
Baby I'll do it
Baby I'll do it
I don't drive no rig
I don't need no car so you cry
Leave me alone leave me alone
I like your face you dig my eyes
Come on now honey try this for sighs
I don't want no lip
I can smell your lies when you cry
Leave me alone leave me alone
You like my face I dig your thighs
Scrap that honey try this for sighs
