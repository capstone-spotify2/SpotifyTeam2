I've got a lot that's on my mind today
But every man got a story to tell
My brother watched his life go down the drain
His addiction took control of him
Everytime I see my brother look at me
I turn my head, to me he's dead

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again

Please my mother don't cry today
I know it's hard cause he's your first born son
Don't blame yourself for the decisions made
I think it's time, we just let him go

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again

All the times you lie
Tell me that you changed
But you never did
You just walked away
It always stays the same
Every time you cried
And you felt afraid
Look at what you did
Now just walk away
You'll never change

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again
