My life's alright when I'm high
I did my best to get by, I told my parents I'd try
I was losing track my mind
So I went to the medicine man, to fix my attention span
He put a pill in my hand
Because life's a breeze when you're slammed

I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watch the clock
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow
I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watch the clock
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow
Tune in, tune out
Breath in, breath out

So whats a little white lie, to parents who never try?
A little prescription high, will help you guys to get by
So lets all take a ride, and we can stand in line
To get a little piece off mind
From the medicine man supply
From the medicine man supply

I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watch the clock
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow
I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watch the clock
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow
Tune in, tune out
Breath in, breath out

I, was floating on a high, up somewhere in the sky...
My teacher ask me 'why I didn't pass the test?'
I have a knot down in my chest
Reach for the bottle of my meds

I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watch the clock
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow

I'm a boy in a box
When your six, watching clocks
Get your fix out of the bottle
Drink it up, and then swallow

Tune in, tune out
Breath in, breath out
