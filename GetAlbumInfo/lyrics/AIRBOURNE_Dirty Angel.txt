I can see right through your lies
All the way through your disguise
I know your deepest secrets
Like Jimmy knows his way around guitar frets

She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
She's a dirty, Dirty Angel

Blonde hair blue eyes I can't decide
You look so good you set me on fire
The way you walk makes people talk
Turn their heads and drop their jaws

She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
She's a dirty, Dirty Angel

She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
She's a dirty, Dirty Angel
