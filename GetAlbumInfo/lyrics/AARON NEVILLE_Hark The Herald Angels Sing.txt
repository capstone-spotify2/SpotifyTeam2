Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"

Hail the heaven, Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with His healing wings

Mild, He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"
