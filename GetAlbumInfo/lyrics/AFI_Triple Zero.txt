It burns! It burns! It burns my eyes and throat, but I need no antidote. 
Gnawing and tearing at my insides -
seething, keeping me alive - hatred poisons me through and through -
a sustenance - keeping me true. It's not too late. 
It's never gonna be too late. 
Embrace your hate. The pain! The pain! 
The pain it crushes me. I gain animosity. Acid sweat and
bloody tears, through it all I preserve. 
Some sedate through indifference but I withheld zero tolerance.
