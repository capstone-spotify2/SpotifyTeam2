There is a way to make
sweet feeling last
There is a way to be
sheltered when the wind is free
There is a way my father
taught me how to sing
And I sing my song every day now

And it won't take much
of your time
Really won't take much
of your time
No, it won't take much
of your precious time
Just to get the spirit deep
in your bones
You really got it, talking
about the spirit
You got it, deep in your bones,
you really got it

There is a way to make the
mountains cry
Suh a way to be comforted,
sweet mystery
There is a way my father taught
me how to live my life
And I do that every day

There is a way to make
sweet feeling last
There is a way to be
comforted, sweet mystery
There is a way my father
taught me how to do it
Do it to it, when I
wanna do it to it.
