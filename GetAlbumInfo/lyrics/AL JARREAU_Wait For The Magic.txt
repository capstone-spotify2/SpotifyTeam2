Billy Jones is a mover
And he has a million plans
Wants to be the big improver
Wants to be a wealthy man
There are days when billy loses hope
Days when hope loses him
He prays he can just hold out
And one day he will win.

Will he wait for the magic
No, not forever
Just wait for the magic again.

College girl wakes up in Boston
And she sips her morning tea
Cup in hand she's deciding
How she wants her life to be.

Well it's been some time
Since the boy she loves
Has found the time to write.

She checks her mail
And there's nothing there
Honey, something isn't right
Will she wait for the magic
No, not forever,
Just wait for the magic again
Never look down, no no
Don't surrender
Just wait for the magic again.

Well you touch him like a master
And you fit him like a glove
And his heart keeps beating faster
Could it be this man's in love.

You may lose, you may win
Find love'll break your heart
The best you can do is take a chance
Jump in and play your part.

As you wait for the magic
No, not forever
Just wait for the magic again
Never look down, no, no
Don't surrender
Just wait for the magic again.

Never look down, no no
Don't surrender
Just wait for the magic again
