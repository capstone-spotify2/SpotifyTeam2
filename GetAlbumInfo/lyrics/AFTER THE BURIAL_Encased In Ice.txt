I have been to the edge before, at the end of the world
But there is nothing for me so I guess I'll just turn around
I will follow my footsteps back home
Still the same as before, but there is nothing for me
So I Guess I'll just turn around
Can't you see that I'm suffocating?
In a world that means nothing to me
My only hope is disintegrating
Wishing someone could carry the weight for me
Can't you see that the ends beginning?
IN this life I've lost all I know
Because hope is a word, that I forgot was feeling
So please hold onto me and I won't let you go
We are nothing more than memories
I'll find the meaning inside this doubt
I will see this through
I'm frozen in time, encased in ice
Break me apart so I can breathe again
