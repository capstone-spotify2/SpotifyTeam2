Another day in my life, another day, I'm insecure, how I'm portrayed in this world. Maybe it's my skin, I know that it's not my mind, that's brought on this social attack. And now I know, what you see isn't what's inside of me. And now I know what you think isn't based upon my mind. So analyze our hate, find out where it is based, maybe you will see it's not me. The world has spit you out and you don't have a reason why. See we're not that different after all.
