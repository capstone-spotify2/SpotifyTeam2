I beat you to the punchline, girl I love you
Now what we what we gon' do?
I mean it really when I say I love you
Whatever he did, I will not do
Cause I hear your prayers late at night when no one's listening
Praying I stay the same

I'm not your father
I won't desert you
I'm not your ex
Not trying to hurt you
I'm just a man
Tryna love you
I'm just a man
Trying to love you

Your walls are so impossible, I'm tired
As I'm climbing, they keep on multiplying
Everytime there's progress, we regress
And I'm stressed
All I wanna know, is why you can't let it go?

I'm not your father
I won't desert you
I'm not your ex
Not trying to hurt you
I'm just a man
Tryna love you
I'm just a man
Trying to love you

Cause everything you ever want
Is standing right in front of you
Everything you ever need
I make sure I put by for you
And I know you're scared
And I've had my days too
Let's just face this thing together, hey!

I'm not your father
I won't desert you
I'm not your ex
Not trying to hurt you
I'm just a man
Tryna love you
I'm just a man
Trying to love you

Hey
Yeah
Give me that chance baby
I wanna love you
Said I wanna love you!
Let me love you baby
Let me love you baby
Ohh!
