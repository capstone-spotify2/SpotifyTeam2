<i>[English Translation:]</i>

Why do you insult my boyfriend in a long time?
Why do you think I am above his deserts? I feel pitiful for you.

It wasnât so long ago that you abandoned me but you want me to get back to you?
You must have been crazy since I saw you last. Just get out of my sight.

Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up Yeah U
Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up (just go)
Iâm warning you for the last time.
Before I shout out could you please get out of my face afar off?
Or letâs stay up all night with me so that I can boast my boyfriend, saying nothing for you.

Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up Yeah U
Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up Yeah U

Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up (just go)

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah From now on
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah In my mind
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh~ you got removed thoroughly.

<i>[Rap:]</i>
Where do you keep looking at?
Take action not to get phone calls from your girl.
Why donât you just lie to her that you donât feel so good.
I wonât be responsible for it though.
You also like it honestly but why do you keep avoiding me?
You push my lip away even though you came here to meet me since you could not forget me.
Are you thinking of having a night with me?
Oh my god look at that plump bag.
Did you say you are thinking of marrying? Then just take me.
Whatâs for âshut upâ? You treat me so arrogantly.
Though secretly cheating on your boyfriend!

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah From now on
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah In my mind
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh~ you got removed thoroughly.

Can you hear me out? Shut Up
Thereâs something wrong. Shut Up Please
Iâm not here to be treated like this. Shut Up
Shut Up Shut Up Shut Up

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I was so thankful
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah You made me laugh
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh I feel better thanks to you
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah (Shut Up to Shut Up)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah (Shut Up to Shut Up)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah (Shut Up to Shut Up)

Oh~ please just go
