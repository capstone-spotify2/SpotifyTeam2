<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The Pain Is Gone!

<i>[Hook: Ab-Soul]</i>
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates but my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
A minute ago, I was riding bicycles
And I can buy you Now &amp; Laters with 5 nickels
When it was washing dishes and homework, cable and bullshit
I hit the block and never left
It was exciting watching life bring light to what I'm writing about like
A lamp in a cave, while I'm trapped in this maze
But Frankie Beverly wouldn't walk in my all-stars for a day
I watched kids play and think ignorance is bliss
Then I watched Kid-N-Play on House Party
And wished I was them
See you can say I'm brainwashed
Cause I came from an era where niggas don't care about nothing
And you're judged by how much your J's cost
But me being the rebel I am, I never gave a damn
Leave it to Beaver and the rest of you suckas
I'm complex like the magazine say I'm abstract
Like a trigonometry quiz and science lab rats
If I wasn't odd, you could see the pain in my eyes
I watched brothers kill brothers over system of legal tender
Deteriorating my loins with liquor looking for joy
I put my soul on a platter of joy
I do this for the regular people who out the ink route
Make it popular to be unpopular
Because if we all came together, ain't no stopping us
And it hurts me so, to think how they divided us
Like an island in the road
Just take control if you ain't know
And yo
Lock my body can't trap my mind
I got two decades of experience on my resume
Say I don't qualify and I'll call you a lie
I'm on a whole another plateau, you still tryna be fly
And that goes for the narrow minded who's ancestor was the pharaoh
He went from Number 1 to Zero
Let's Take it back

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The Pain is gone!

<i>[Punch:]</i>
Nah she still on me
She stalking my innermost thoughts, I guess she want me
Because he primary fear is to die lonely
I got, no disdain for Ms. Pain
She leaves me love letters sealed with a kiss
Lipstick stains on the mirror
She helps me see things a little clearer
Couldn't experience joy if she wasn't near us
I remember throwing shots back til' I collapsed
Waking up hung over in the effort to give her the cold shoulder
It never worked
As soon as I sobered up, I couldn't avoid her tender touch
Like when Izakaya died
I couldn't look his mama in the eyes
Feeling like I contributed to his demise
Guilt stricken, heart victimized
Postpartum Syndrome, I'm blacking out
She's wishing it was me, she cried
Each tear was like a symphony orchestra
Beethoven over the organs, she snapping a tremendous proportion
Take this recording as the truth distorted
Through the eyes of a man who reaped the fruits of her courtship
And no fortune could ever overturn the misfortunes I absorbed in
The pain made me impure like foreskin, more that I can bargain
Fool, still I love her forever more

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The Pain is Gone!

<i>[Hook: Ab-Soul]</i>
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates, But my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
And even when I die, she's going to follow my kids
