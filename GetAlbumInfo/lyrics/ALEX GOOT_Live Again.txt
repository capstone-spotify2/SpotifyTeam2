I just need somewhere to lay my head before the hour is gone
And I remember when the days were so much easier
They used to tell me that my dreams could be achieved

And just you wait, you wait and see
Your life is gone, whatâs left a mystery
Itâs just as easy to believe
The day will come when we can live again

These overwhelming facts of life are enough to scare anyone
It turns out youâre not immune to anything in the long run

And just you wait, you wait and see
Your life is gone, whatâs left a mystery
Itâs just as easy to believe
The day will come when we can live again

I refuse to let this conquer me.
And I
I made a pact with me myself and I
I canât be scared, I must move on
No matter what they say to me

And just you wait, you wait and see
Your life is gone, whatâs left a mystery
Itâs just as easy to believe
The day will come when we can live again
