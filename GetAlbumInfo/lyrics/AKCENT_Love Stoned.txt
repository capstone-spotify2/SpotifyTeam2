How deep is your love
Bring me sign my baby
How deep is your love
How deep is your

My world is falling
Without you
But you don't care
About anything besides you
I've been calling
Your number forever
But the silence was always
An answer

How deep is your love
Bring me sign my baby
How deep is your love
Spread the way inside
How deep is your

My love is fading without you
It's so cold here, I love to be beside you
I've been calling
Your number forever
But the silence was always
An answer

How deep is your love
Bring me sign my baby
How deep is your love
Spread the way inside
How deep is your

Bring me sign my baby Spread the way inside

How deep is your love
Bring me sign my baby
How deep is your love
Spread the way inside
How deep is your
