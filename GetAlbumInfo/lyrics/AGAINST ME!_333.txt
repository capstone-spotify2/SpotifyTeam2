Feeling like I need to fall down some stairs
Maybe lay face down in the river and float
Perfect weather for a head wound
Or studying sophisticated nuances of putting holes in your lungs
150 Marilyns, the war and the bomb
All reasons to be fearful but every new day to wake up

333, say that they knew me
333, bring it all back to me

All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you

I saw the "The Renowned Orders of the Night" in person
Why would I ever meet that with irony or cynicism?
Planned views and elevations walking through your tarot garden
Visible mutations fading right before your fucking eyes
Cycles of death and regeneration, sensations of absence and loss
I wish you had been there by my side to see it all

333, say that they knew me
333, bring your love back to me

All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you

All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
