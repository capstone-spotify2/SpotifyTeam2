Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know that she loves you a lot
Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know, don't you?

Ah there's a chill in the summer time air
You get a thrill from the smell of her hair
You get high from the taste of her wet
It's certified, but but, but you ain't getting there yet
Still can't forgive but baby cut me some slack
Still got a feel you ain't never coming back
You don't want the karma but you won't commit
You'll be spanking your monkey when she's all up in your sh*t

Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know that she loves you a lot
Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
I know you do cause I told you

Is that your girl in a lily white dress
How come she's so fucking passive-agress
I hear you say with your adorable tongue
And that you just don't care how especially yeah
While the night is still young
Still you raise your imagination
Do that ration, generation, single patience
Contamination, suffocation

Don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know that she's hot
Why don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
I know you do because

Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know that she's hot
Ah don't you know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got
I even know that she loves you a lot
Ah don't you know, don't you know, don't you know what you got
