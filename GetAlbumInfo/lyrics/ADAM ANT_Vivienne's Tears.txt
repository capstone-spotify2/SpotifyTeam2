I met Vivienne 30 years ago
She was walking down Kings Road
She had beautiful head, beautiful legs,
Beautiful legs

A cup of coffee in Beaufort Street
Don't know me from Adam
Because Vivienne's tears flood everywhere
She can make your garden grow
Vivienne's tears flow everywhere
She can make your garden, garden, garden grow

I met Vivienne at the Vortex Club
I was wasted after the show
She had beautiful legs, beautiful eyes,
Beautiful thighs

You shouldn't be a singer Adam, oh dear me no
You shouldn't sing at all
Should I have taken your advice?
It wasn't very nice

Well you were very funny from the first
With your garlic cure for thrush
Living on the planet, Vivienne,
Gave me the bums rush

Because Vivienne's tears flood everywhere
She can make your garden grow
Vivienne's tears flow everywhere
She can make your garden, garden, garden grow

Buy at the sound of trumpets, sell when there's
Blood on the streets
