Hey ya'll 
Come over here, check this out 
And gimme a minute of your time, but don't doubt 
Anything that I tell ya'll, listen up closely 
It's something ghostly, my ancestors told me 
Way back before we walked the earth 
It was so much cleaner cause it wasn't disturbed 
But there was still hatred and strugglin' for our color 
Cause if you had nothing you were bound to smother 
And I don't know why, cause helping hands should be a must 
It was written on the manuscript, in the book you trust 
Unless it's all just a way to get us arguin' 
Believe what you feel, even if it's a life of sin 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 

Ever since there's been a jail cell 
Murder's been committed 
Thou shalt not kill, and who's the one sinnin'? 
At the end of all of this, will they be judged? 
Punished for the life they took with no grudge 
Nowadays, things sure ain't changed 
There's a whole lot of states allowed to fry your brains 
That's cause lately we just burn it away 
Let them build they own prisons where their ass can stay 
It's a wonder how we let things happen 
I ain't special 
But I enjoy takin' it to another level 
Bad choices lead to a terrible afterlife 
So, just learn your wrongs from right 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 

Hey ya'll 
I don't mean to get ya thinkin' about 
Things that's gonna get ya down and out 
There just things I had to get up off my chest 
Cause I'm trying to relax and just do my best 
I don't wanna take a situation, and turn it upside down 
I just feel this world's fuckin' around 
I mean, who am I to judge? 
I just, I was raised to be strong enough 
Hey ya'll 
Do you understand what I'm saying? 
Hey ya'll 
My ancestors got me down on my knees prayin' 
Hey ya'll 
They keep tellin' me to spread the word 
Hey ya'll 
Cause when they come their gonna test what you have learned 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 

Hey ya'll 
Hey ya'll! 

Retaliation, what now bitch!!
