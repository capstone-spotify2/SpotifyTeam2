Are you tired, of me
Do you want to, be free
I just got to know
Should I hang on, or let go
Don't keep me guessing
It just ain't fair
You got me drowning in a sea of despair

I've held up for as long as I can
Ohhh I need to know, am I still your man

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do
Na na na na
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do
Na na na na na na

Putting pressure, on my heart
Maybe we need some time apart
We need to find out what's gone wrong
Before the love's completely gone

I've held up for as long as I can
I need to know am I still your man
I'll be past the point, of no returns
Is there a reason to be concerned

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Give me a chance 
to say what's left of my pride
Please tell me girl
Is the grass greener on the other side

<i>[Chorus]</i>
