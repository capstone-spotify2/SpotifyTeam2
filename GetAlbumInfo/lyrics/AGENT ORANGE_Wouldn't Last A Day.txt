could it be that you were hoping
something new would change your life?
a different view of things
that mattered long ago
and if you had your way
would everything be like it was before?
could it be that you would never ask for more?

i know that i'd never last a day without you
i wouldn't last a day without you

would it be too much to ask
if we could save a little time?
it's such a precious thing
that seems so hard to find
and if we get the chance
let's hope that you and i won't change our minds
we'll twist and tangle as our destinies unwind

i know that i wouldn't last a day without you
i couldn't find my way without you
i don't know what to say without you
i wouldn't last a day without you

i look into into sun - am i the only one
that doesn't see the future anymore?

you wouldn't last a day
i will not go away
and in the end there will be no long goodbye
