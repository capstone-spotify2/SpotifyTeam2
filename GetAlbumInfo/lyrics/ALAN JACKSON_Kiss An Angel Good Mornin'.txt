Whenever a chance to meet 
Some old friends on the street 
They wonder how does a man 
Get to be this way 
I always got a smiling face 
Any time and any place 
And everytime they ask me why 
I just smile and say 

You've got to kiss angel good mornin' 
And let her know you think 
About her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil 
When you get back home 

Now people may try to guess 
The secret of happeniness 
Some of them never learn 
It's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of 
Is a woman and a man in love 
And the anwser is in this song 
That I always sing 

You got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think 
About her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil 
When you get back home 

Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think 
About her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil 
When you get back home...
