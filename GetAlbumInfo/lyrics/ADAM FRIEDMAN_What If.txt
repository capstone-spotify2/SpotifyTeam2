What if I never met you last May
What if I did, what if I didn't
What if we never got drunk that day
Talking 'bout shit, I'll never forget

Yeah, those jeans you were wearing
The way you were swearing
Oh girl we had nothing to lose
What if I never fell in love last May
What if I did, what if I didn't

But we live
And we lie
And we love
And we cry
And we learn to survive
And we start asking why

I don't need no religion
Darling, you're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything let it all go
Who are we what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in

What if you never looked at me that way
What if you did, what if you didn't
What if you took the job and moved away
Forgot about us, forgot about love

But we got through diseases
You stayed for a reason
Your love keeps on preaching in me
What if you never looked at me that way
What if we stopped asking why

I don't need no religion
Darling, you're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything let it all go
Who are we what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in

I don't need no religion
You're enough to believe in

And when I'm at the gate you're waiting
Whenever my soul needs saving
You're the only one I'm praying to

I don't need no religion
You're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything let it all go
Who are we what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in
You're enough to believe in
