Take my hand, touch my face
Let me feel your embrace
Let me see in your eyes
That you wonât say goodbye
Just tell me how you feel
I donât know what youâre thinking anymore

And if you need me, youâd kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, youâd show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
Youâd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while Iâm feeling strong
I sing you one last song

Let me ask time has passed
Do you feel this could last
If you donât, why then stay
Take your wings, fly away
I love you way too much
To wanna be the one who brings you down

And if you need me, youâd kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, youâd show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
Youâd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while Iâm feeling strong
I sing you one last song

One last song I sing for you
Like I always did
This time itâs for real
I never come to you like this
Expecting you to turn my kiss
Oh no no no no no

And if you need me, youâd kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, youâd show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
Youâd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while Iâm feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Oh yeah
I sing you one last song
I sing you one last song
