I wonder how my life would be
If I had grown up by the sea
And lived a little
I wonder if my heart could grow
If the only love I know
Was all I needed

Sometimes I wish that I
Could fly away from here
âCause what if it all goes wrong?

Would it be bad if I drove too far
And forgot my way around?
Maybe my worry would disappear
If Iâm nowhere to be found
So maybe Iâll drive too far

I wonder how my voice would sound
If it was in the background
No one heard it
I wonder how it feels to speak
Still be heard without the need
To be the loudest

Sometimes I wish that I
(Sometimes I wish that I)
Could fly away from here
(Could fly away from here)
âCause what if it all goes wrong?

Oh, my vision's blurry now
(My vision's blurry now)
I wish it all was clear
(I wish it all was clear)
Not knowing's killing me

Would it be bad if I drove too far
And forgot my way around?
Maybe my worry would disappear
If Iâm nowhere to be found
So maybe Iâll drive too far

Sometimes I wish that I
Could fly away from here
What if it all goes wrong?
My vision's blurry now
(My vision's blurry all now)
I wish it all was clear
(I wish it all was clear)
Not knowing's killing me

Would it be bad if I drove too far
And forgot my way around?
Maybe my worry would disappear
If Iâm nowhere to be found
And lived a little

Oh (Would it be bad if I drove too far)
Oh (Forgot my way around?)
Yeah, maybe my worry would disappear
(Maybe my worry would disappear)
If Iâm nowhere to be found
(If Iâm nowhere to be found)
So maybe Iâll drive too far
Maybe Iâll drive too far
