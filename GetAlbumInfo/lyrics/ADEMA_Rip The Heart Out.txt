I woke up this morning and knew
That the world would test me come unglued
Is it me or do you feel my pain
This world makes my blood boil again

You rip the heart out of me
You rip the heart out of me
You make it look easy
Control and deceive me

I've tried to everything to please you
Gone out of my way like a fool
What makes me break down like a bitch
It's so hard to crawl out of this ditch
