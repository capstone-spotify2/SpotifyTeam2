Theres a girl in the street
You should see the tears in her eyes
Cause she weeps, for a man who told her lies
And the man that she loved
Left here for somebody new
And the girl, she dreams
That if only they could've seen

Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye
Love is a lie
Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye
Love is a lie
One day hes gonna pay

Theres a man down the street
You cant see the pain in his heart
And he weeps, for a love that he has lost
And the man left a love
To go and ind somebody new
Like the girl in his dream
Now if they only could've seen

Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye
Love is a lie
Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye
Love is a lie
One day shes gonna pay
One day shes gonna pay
