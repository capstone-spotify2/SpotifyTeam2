You can run through every forest
You can sail in the seven seas
You can climb the highest mountain
To try and dissolve these memories

In case you never knew it
You canât undo it

You can jump off the edge of the world
Hide out in some monastery
Lose your mind in meditation
And never put your mind at ease

You think youâre running to it
But you are wading through it
A sunny mystery

Life is the dream that you wake up to
Dreams are the life from which you wake
Everybody makes the extra effort
Never knowing what to do

But you know the answer
Yeah, you know the score
It feels just like before

Itâs a sunny mystery
Thatâs how itâs got to be
Because no one knows for sure
The outcome of this
Sunny mystery
