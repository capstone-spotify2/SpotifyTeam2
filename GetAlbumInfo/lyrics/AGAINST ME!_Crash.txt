What happened to us? What happened to us?
What happened to something that never was

I'm not a crash landing

The DNA has changed old hairs shed
Like nails clipped into bathroom trash cans

I'm not a crash landing
I'm not a crash landing
Let me stay up in your orbit a while
Let me stay up in your orbit a while

Crash landing
Crash landing

Do you sleep with your windows open?
Would you watch through mine if you could?
I just want to say the words to someone
Like I used to say the words to you

I'm not a crash landing
I'm not a crash landing
I'm not a crash landing
Let me stay up in your orbit a while
Let me stay up in your orbit a while

Good times always getting older
Good times you wish could last forever
Good times always getting older
Good times you wish could last forever
Good times always getting older
Good times you wish could last forever

Crash landing
I'm not a crash landing
I'm not a crash landing
Let me stay up in your orbit a while
Let me stay up in your orbit a while

Crash landing
Crash landing
Crash landing
Crash landing
