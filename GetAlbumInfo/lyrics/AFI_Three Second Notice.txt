Submission- My back hurts from bowing down.
Attraction - Was once so strong now can't be found. 
Affection - One gift i wish you would return. 
Frustration - as i accede.
i do not deserve your frigidness, such callousness, yet i persist.
What's wrong with me? 
I told you "you can't be replaced", you showed me I'm disposable. 
Spit in my face, as I submit, so I quit!
