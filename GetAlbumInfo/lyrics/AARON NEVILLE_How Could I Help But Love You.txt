When you hold me close, 
Honey, you're the most, 
Baby, you set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, 
Honey, I had to get you, 
You have been my one desire

How could I help but love you 
With a love so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part, 
It wouldn't be your fault, 
Yeah, it would be all mine

If you would ever leave me, 
Honey, it sure would grieve me, 
Baby, it would break my heart
But I won't let that worry me, 
This love will always be, 
It was meant right from the start

How could I help but love you, 
With a love so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part, 
It wouldn't be your fault, 
Yeah, it would be all mine

When you hold me close, 
Honey, you're the most, 
Baby, you set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, 
Honey, I had to get you, 
You have been my one desire

How could I help but love you, 
With a love so so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine

If we would ever part ...
