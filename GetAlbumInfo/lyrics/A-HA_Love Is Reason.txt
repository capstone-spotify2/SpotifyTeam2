My breath was coming fast
And as i make a start
You turn to go
oh, oh
I'll do what you want me to
I'll cry at the thought of the loss of a 
heart

Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason enough

My morals are changing fast
I told you it wouldn't last
You turn and go
oh, oh
I'll be what you want me to be
I'd die at the thought of the loss of 
your heart

Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason enough
