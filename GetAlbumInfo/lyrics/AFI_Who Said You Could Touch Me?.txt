You don't know I am so,
you can not get close to me
and I don't know who you are,
so just leave me alone.
I know you can't believe
the anxiety you're causing me
and I know you can't believe
your fake compassion I don't need.
Get away from me, You're standing too close.
Keep your hands off of me.
Keep away from me, Just leave me alone,
who said you could touch me anyway?
Don't try to rub my shoulders
and don't try to hold my hand.
Don't try to give me a fucking hug.
You crawl on me as if I were your very best of friends.
I don't even know your name.
Get away from me, You're standing too close.
Keep your hands off of me.
Keep away from me, Just leave me alone,
who said you could touch me anyway?
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. ah!
