Now there's a shadow passing over our faces
Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while we'll have to pick up the traces
We won't find the missing parts.
Buy me a ticket I'll go to the Bahamas
I need a rest from our petty little dramas
Yes I really do

Aha um hum
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun,
Baby you owe me one.
Aha un hum
It's my turn to run
A chance to see the sun,
Baby you owe me one.

I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation on our hearts.
Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Yes I really do

Aha um hum
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun,
Baby you owe me one.
Aha un hum
It's my turn to run
A chance to see the sun,
Baby you owe me one.
