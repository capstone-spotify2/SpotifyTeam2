A Rollin' rock,
Electric shock
She gives a lickin' that doesn't stop (That don't stop)

She line 'em up,
Push you 'round
Smokin' rings going round and round

Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standing proud

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
hard as a rock (I'm hard as a rock)
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
(Well it's harder than a rock)
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
(Well it's harder than a rock)

The lightnin' rod,
Strike it hot
Gonna hit you like a Rushmore rock
(It's gonna hit you like a Rushmore rock)

No nicotine, and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty it's darn right mean
Hell elevator
I'll see you later (Yeah, sooner or later)
no I ain't gonna take it I'm busting out
(Listen, I'm busting out)

<i>[Chorus]</i>

yea
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock yea
I'm getting harder yeah yeeeeeeeeaahh!
harder than a rock
Well I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Baby I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well it's harder than a rock
hard as a rock
Yeah it's harder than a rock yeah
hard as a rock well
I'm harder than a rock
hard as a rock yes
I'm harder, harder, harder, harder than a rock.
