Pretty eyes
Staring back at me so blue and wide
The colors of the summer sky
The colors of the world

If love is blind,
Why do I see you so clearly now?
Perfect vision of our love somehow
You take over my mind

Look up into the galaxy tonight
The stars illuminate the love we make

Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me alive, keep me alive
(keep me alive)
Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me alive, keep me alive

Pretty eyes
Youâre the one that keeps up all night
I know
No one else could make me feel this way
I want to look up into the milky way tonight

The sky illuminates the love we make
The love we make so bright

Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me a live, keep me a live
(keep me a live)
Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me a live, keep me a live

As the moon shines its light on you
Your pretty eyes they glow
Tell me that youâll stay the night
Just stay a while

Owoooooo
Ooohooohoooooo
Oohooowowooo

Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me a live, keep me a live
(keep me a live)
Cause you and your pretty eyes
You keep me alive, keep me alive
