Electric feel your hands around me 
Up and down me rest my mind
Unbroken seal your light astounds me
Take my dark and let it shine

Brighter than this path before me 
Reassure me take my hand
Hypnotize me then rewrite me 
Anything but fight this
Anything but fight this

Electric feel your hands around me 
Up and down me rest my mind
Unbroken seal your light astounds me
Take my dark and let it shine

Brighter than this path before me 
Reassure me take my hand
Hypnotize me then rewrite me 
Anything but fight this
Anything but fight this

(Can we not be great together?)

In this day I'm fascinated, too much time deliberated
Wasted, over nothing at all we could have made this, but now weâre nothing at all
In this day I'm fascinated, too much time deliberated
Wasted, over nothing at all we could have made this, but now weâre nothing at all

Unspoken words a powerful surge of all Iâve heard of on this earth
Rewritten rules will you abuse me use me âtil all thatâs left is dirt
Feel it running through this person youâve been cursing ease your tongue
Hypnotize me then rewrite me anything but fight this, anything but fight this

(Can we not be great together?)

In this day I'm fascinated, too much time deliberated
Wasted, over nothing at all we could have made this, but now weâre nothing at all
In this day I'm fascinated, too much time deliberated
Wasted, over nothing at all we could have made this, but now weâre nothing at all

Too long since I held you all wrong then I met you 
Please donât let this take you 
Please donât let this break you
Too long since I kissed you all wrong now I miss you 
Please donât let it take you
Please donât

(Can we not be great together?)
