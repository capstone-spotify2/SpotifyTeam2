Way way back in the 1980's
Secret government employees
Dug up famous guys and ladies
And made amusing genetic copies
Now their clones are sexy teens
Now they're going to make it if they tried
Loving, learning, sharing, judging
Time to laugh, and shiver and cry

Time to watch,
Clone high
Energetic and engaging
Clone high
Our angst is entertaining
Clone high
Our lives are never boring
Who am I?

There's a place that you can go to
And it's never very far
Famous people you can live through
If you don't know who you are
Why, there is so much to live up to
Expectations are so high
I'm not crying
It's my contacts
There must be something in my eye

You all must watch,
Clone high
Inspired and organic
Clone high
Possibly dramatic
Clone high
More fun than watching static
Where am I?
Clone high

Time to laugh, and shiver and cry...

I'll see you at
Clone high
I can't escape my name
Clone high
That's the price of fame
Clone high
Life is just a game
That's why...
Clone high
