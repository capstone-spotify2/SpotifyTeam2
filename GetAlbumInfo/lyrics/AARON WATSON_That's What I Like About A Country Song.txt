I heard someone out poking fun 
At the ol' country boy and the songs that he sung 
Still cracking jokes he sarcastically implied 
Let me guess your girls gone and your dog just died, 
and I said hey...

That's what I like about a country song
where somebody done somebody wrong
Not just something that is understood, 
by those high rollers in Hollywood
It's about real folks living a real life with real problems, like and old ex wife
If you agree with the boys and me then sing along, 
that's what I like about a country song 

Some like to rock, some like to roll
Some like it fast and some like it slow
If you're left or right or right down the middle 
Everybody stops to listen when that bow hits the fiddle 
It's music for the rich or poor, 
hot mamas driving to the grocery store
All the farmers, the doctors, 
the truckers and the teachers 
The young punks, the old drunks, 
even Church of Christ preachers 
PRAISE THE LORD!

That's what I like about a country song
where somebody done somebody wrong
Not just something that is understood, 
by those high rollers in Hollywood
It's about real folks living a real life with real problems, like a future ex wife
If you agree with the boys and me then sing along, 
that's what I like about,
that's what I like about,
