if your whole life feels incomplete
learn this song and sing yourself to sleep

anger turns to hatred - as the nights turn into days
people disappoint me in so many different ways
close your eyes - drift off to sleep
this song i sing is yours to keep
think of me, you'll be all right - we'll be together
in your dreams tonight
intensify the feel, the sound, the sight
we'll be together - in your dreams tonight

love belongs to no one - no one seems to care
i'm convinced that i could change your mind
if i was there
don't be sad, it's not so bad
just use your weary mind to add
some color to these lives - all black and white
in your dreams tonight
intensify the feel, the sound, the sight
in living color - in your dreams tonight

people try so hard - it doesn't mean a thing
just think of all the happiness
this little one will bring
looking through your eyes
i see the things you see
reaching out to grab a hold of me
in your dreams tonight
intensify the feel, the sound, the sight
i promise i'll be in your dreams tonight
