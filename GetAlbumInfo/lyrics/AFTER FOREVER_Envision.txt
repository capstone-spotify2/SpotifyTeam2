I see it, I hear but cannot know how you are feeling
I sense it but can't comprehend 

He's standing there waiting for the news to hear what's wrong with her
His feelings go way beyond my own

Only sense it, only imagine their fate
Just envision, the only way to relate

We try to, we say so but we can only imagine
We want to, but can't empathize

She's laying there crying, for the truth was stronger than her pain
Her feelings go way beyond my own

Only sense it, only imagine their fate
Just envision, the only way to relate for real
Can we sense it? Can we imagine their fate?
Just envision, there is no way we relate for real
