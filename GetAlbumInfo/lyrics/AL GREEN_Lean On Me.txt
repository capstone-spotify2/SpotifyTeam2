Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
But, if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.

Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend,
I'll help you carry on. For it won't be long, till I'm gonna need
somebody to lean on.

Please, swallow your pride, if I have
faith, you need to borrow. For no one can fill those of your
needs, that you won't let show.

You just call on me, brother when you need a hand,
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand, 
we all need somebody to lean on.

Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend,

somebody to lean on.

You just call on me, brother when you need a hand,
we all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand, 
we all need somebody to lean on.

If, there is a load, you have to bear, that you can't carry,
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load, if you just call me.

Call me......
