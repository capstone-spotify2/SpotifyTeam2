Don't let them tell you lies
Those voices in your mind
Pay attention when
People call you friend
And remind you of your light
Don't try to analyze
You're imperfect, so am I
Pay attention to
Those reminding you
You were made to bring us life

And you are everything, everything
That you ever dreamed you could be
And you bring everything, everything to life 
And I wish you could see
That darling, you are everything

Don't be afraid of change
You are braver than you say
Don't listen to
Those criticizing you
They don't even know your name
There's beauty in your scars

So don't paint away your flaws
Every crooked line
Is evidence you smile
And that's the hope that leads us on

And you are everything, everything
That you ever dreamed you could be
And you bring everything, everything to life 
And I wish you could see
That darling, you are everything

And you are everything, everything
That you ever dreamed you could be
And you bring everything, everything to life 
And I wish you could see
Your pieces are enough for me
'Cause darling you are everything
