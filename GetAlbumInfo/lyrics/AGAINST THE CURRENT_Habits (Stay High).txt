Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
I've gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend

To keep you off my mind

To keep you off my mind

Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
I've gotta stay high all my life
