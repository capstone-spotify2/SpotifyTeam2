Come to me
Whenever you're in time of need
I won't melt away
Like a fair-weather friend
On me you can depend

If I may
I'd like to take this time to say
I'll be by your side
Til the sun grows dark
And the moon brings light of day

Oh it's me for you and you for me
That's how it's got to be
Though fainter hearts
May come and go
Here's one thing you'll always know

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Through it all
You can depend on me
When tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all
I will ease your pain
When sorrows comes to call
Oh, through it all

When you say
You've never been loved quiet this way
I have to smile
And take credit for being
The first to truly say

Oh through it all
A spirit that's brighter by far
Then all of the stars
That shine through the night
You glow with heaven's light
It's me for you and you for me
That's how it got to be
Though love affairs
May come and go
Here's one thing you always know

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Through it all
You can depend on me
When tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all
I will ease your pain
When sorrows comes to call
Through it all <i>[2x]</i>

No empty promises you can be sure
We've both been down this road
And this time it's so much more
So much more

Through it all <i>[3x]</i>
I will ease your pain
When sorrows comes to call
I will stop the rain
(I'll be here beside you)
(The pain and rain can't hide)
(I'll be here beside you)
(The pain and rain can't hide)
(I'll be here beside you)
(The pain and rain can't hide)
