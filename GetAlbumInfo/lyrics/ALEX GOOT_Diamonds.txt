Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
Weâre like diamonds in the sky

Youâre a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, Iâm alive
Weâre like diamonds in the sky

I knew that weâd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
Weâre beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
Weâre beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Weâre beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Weâre beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, weâll never die
Weâre like diamonds in the sky

Youâre a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, Iâm alive
Weâre like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Weâre beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
