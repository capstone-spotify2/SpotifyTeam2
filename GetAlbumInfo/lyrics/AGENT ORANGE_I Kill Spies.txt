you've never seen my face before
you will not recognize my voice
i am the perfect law to end these wicked crimes
i am a man without a past
i face a world without a future
and i've done it all at least a million times
i'm the eyes that read between the lines
i devise the rumors - and vicious lies
i do everything i can to hide the truth
but can you see it in my eyes?
i kill spies

as i walked into the room
i couldn't help but feel the tension
i can hear your thoughts - i can read your mind
i've been through this all before
by persistence - by intention
i just do my job and leave the past behind
once there was a time when i believed
anything could happen - at any time
i've been waiting for this moment all my life
and now at last - the pleasure's mine
i kill spies
