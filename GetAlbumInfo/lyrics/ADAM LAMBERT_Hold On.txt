I'm alone, head strong
Now we on a mission
Stomping out all the rules of the game
Anti up, sleeves up
Now you got the vision
Bullet proof
And we're not gon change

The world eyes looking down cause we seem different
We got eachother and who cares who knows
If ignorance is bliss why they still bitchin
Haters eat our dust cause the winds gon blow

They say that we are only
Hopeless and alone
And they say we don't know who we are
Hold on now

They can't come between us
They'll never defeat us
We won't break so easily
Hold on now

Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust your gonna find it
Baby it's alright
You're born to fly

Just hold on

Misfits won't quite
Get your arms up
No one else can bring it like us

Rock and roll with the punches
Lights out
Hold on when the goin gets tough

They say that we are only
Hopeless and alone
And they say we don't know who we are
Hold on now

They can't come between us
They'll never defeat us
We won't break so easily
Hold on now

Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust your gonna find it
Baby it's alright
You're born to fly

Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on

Hold on now

Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust you're gonna find it
Baby it's alright
You're born to fly

Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on
Just hold on

I said just hold on
I said just hold on
Just hold on
