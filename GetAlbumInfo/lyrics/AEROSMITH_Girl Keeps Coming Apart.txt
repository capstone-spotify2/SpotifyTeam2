She was a 42nd street walker,
hangin' out down by a cheap hotel,
same old floosey floppin' in the wind,
titties and all,
that's right.

She's right peculiar
She'll try and fool ya
But the girl keeps coming apart

She's so appealing
Right off the ceiling
Yeah, the girl keeps coming apart

What did I tell ya
She buy and sell ya
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart

She's so affected
I'm so rejected
And the girl keeps coming apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down
Don't let it get me down

She's just a screamer
A nightmare dreamer
Yeah the girl keeps coming apart

She's like a call girl
Loose ends and all girl
But the girl keeps coming apart

White lace and leather
She's so together
But the girl keeps coming apart

I feel so sedated
Boxed up and crated
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Let it get me down
Don't let it get me down

So there she was
Buns up and kneelin'
I was wheelin' and a dealin'
My ace in the hole so to speak
