I wanna be more real than all the others
I wanna be more real than all the rest
I wanna be so real, you can see the difference

All of the places that we never went before
All of the times that we never had
They're dead in the past
Dead in the past

I wanna know how you stay you
The world is not enough, I want your brutal truth

I am still waiting for the visions
Possession has yet to take hold of me
We all want to burn on a pyre
So tell me what kind of witch are you

The skin on your neck looks a little thin
Don't go sticking it out for me
Like a beggar with a cold cup to fill
I am the dirt under your nails

I wanna know how you stay you
The world is not enough, I want your brutal truth
I wanna know how you stay you
The world is not enough, I want your brutal truth

The finest attributes of an amputee
Something to eat instead of what you need to feed
One day closer than the last
No more or less dead than the last second pass

I wanna know how you stay you
The world is not enough, I want your brutal truth
I wanna know how you stay you
The world is not enough, I want your brutal truth
