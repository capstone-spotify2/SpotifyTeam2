Die!

I gave in to
The stress in life
I can't escape
The pressure seems to get me down

It's like a needle in my spine
It stings inside
Poisons me with time
I can't deal with your lies

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't get 
(Your lies)

People have said (They have said)
I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I lost my mind, numb me 'til I won't feel pain again

It's like a needle in my spine
It stings inside
Poisons me with time
I won't deal with your lies

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't get 
(Your lies)

Life is gone
I have no one
Life is good
I am no one

Life is gone
I have no one
Life is scarred
I am no one

Life is gone
I have a lie

Something, something inside of my mind
Let it all go and tie me to your fight
Nothing is real inside, just the lies
Something keeps building you high with lies

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't bend
(The lies)

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't bend
