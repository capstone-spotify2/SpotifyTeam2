I wanna, I wanna come back home, baby
Out here baby everything is wrong, baby

In a dog-eat-dog world
Ain't nothing safe, baby
You've got mine, I've got yours
Everything's okay

I started out poor baby
Everybody knows you never told, baby
I got what it takes with my crazy ways
You came along and started this song
Everything's okay

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby

You came along with your crazy ways
You came along and started this
Everything's okay

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
