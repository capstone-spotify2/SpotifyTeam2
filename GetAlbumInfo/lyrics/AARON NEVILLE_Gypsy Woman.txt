From nowhere, through a caravan,
Around the camp fire light,
A lovely woman in motion
But hair as dark as night.
Her eyes were like that of a candle doll
But it returns me with love.

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman.

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody.
And from far her face was all a glow
How seen a chat in me.
Oh, how Iâd like to hold her,
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman,
I love you, gypsy woman.

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun,
Everyone was in heaven.
I hate to see the lady go,
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her.

Gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman.

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun,
Everyone was in heaven.
I hate to see the lady go,
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her.

Gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman.
