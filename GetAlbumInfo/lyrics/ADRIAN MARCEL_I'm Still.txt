I got a dollar and a dream and this kush that I'm fent to start rollin up
People ask me how it feels, its so real when you about to start blowing up
Everybody come around when it's good and I see as I'm growing up
That they ain't really real yeah
Paying the cost to be the boss
Nigga's mad cuz the team is taking off
Bad bitches begging me to break em off
Fake homies wanna call me cause they fallin off

Each day I see my life so much clearer thru the smoke and mirror
And every day I'm still
I'm still the same man I was before
Never will I let it change me
Sometimes i sit alone
Hoping that this life won't faze me

I got a call from my ex
Said: "Congratulations on your deal"
(Congratulations yeah yeah)
Say she hopes I stay the same
Never change and I keep it real
I remember when she cheated on me with my nigga in the past
She say she wish that she could take it back
(I know ,I know )
I know she hates She didn't wait
She fucked it up when I was just becoming great
And now she settling for shit she'd never take
From a nigga who be causing all this pain
I hope one day you'll see it much clearer
Who you need to be

Cuz baby I am still
I'm still the same man I was before, yeah
Never will I let it change me, no
Sometimes i sit alone, yeah
Hoping that this life won't faze me
Whoa
(Keep it real)
