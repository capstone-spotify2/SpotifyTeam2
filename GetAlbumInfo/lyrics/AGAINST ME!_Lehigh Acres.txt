Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Vacant lots and boarded up windows
Garbage piled up at the curb
There's a bank foreclosure notice taped to your front door

Who else is to blame for your own short sighted fate, kid?
What you could afford was never enough. You had to have more.
And now you're facing this new reality
You're learning lessons that can only be taught through poverty.
Florida Dreaming.
Easy money in the sunshine state.
Florida Dreaming.
The life you always wanted.

Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Million dollar high-rise condominiums
Look down over gold coast streams
While Henrietta Hughes begs the President for a home
Yeah, there's no end in sight, just a tropical third world
Has the volume of wealth ever excused such abhorred gluttony?
And now you're facing this new reality
You're learning lessons that can only be taught through poverty.
Florida Dreaming.
Easy money in the sunshine state.
Florida Dreaming.
The life you've always wanted.
Florida Dreaming.
Florida Dreaming.
Florida Dreaming.
The life you've always wanted: Cut me offs.
