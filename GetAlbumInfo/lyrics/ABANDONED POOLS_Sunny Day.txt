Hiding inside a crowd
My head is inside a cloud
Go where the music's loud
And all these talking heads are
Blurred in violet hues 

Another Sunny Day 

She doesn't know wrong from right
She doesn't know when to fight
She only knows that tonight there's always someone out there
She'll never be alone

Another Sunny Day
C'mon get out

Get off the bathroom floor
Daddy's not here no more
I'm showing you to the door
Enough of always numb and always insecure

Hiding inside a cloud
Go where the music's loud
My head is inside a crowd
And all this talk of rock-stars really makes me sick
