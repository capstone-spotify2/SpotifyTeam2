Baby you don't know,what you do to me.
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry.
Won't let no one come and take your place.
Cause the love you give can't be replaced.
See no one else love me like you do.
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you.
Wanna please you in anyway I can.
Wanna share my world don't you understand.

Your love is a one in a million it goes on and on and on
you give me a really good feelin all day long.
