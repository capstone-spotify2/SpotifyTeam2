Heartbreak, incarnate, I'm nothing if not your memories
Heartbreak, please let me be your joy and your pain

Someday, I will be...
I'll be those common words spoken uniquely
Because I may, will forever be floating as you feel.
Where all remaining failed

Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past are tear stained and wrinkled
Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past are tear stained and wrinkled

(Just say...) Say you will follow me (follow me)
Invite me to your memory
(Just sing...) Sing again follow me (follow me)
That long forgotten song

Heartbreak, incarnate, I'm nothing if not your memories
Heartbreak, please let me be your joy and your pain

Someday, I will be...
I'll be that waking warmth from a fading dream
Because I will, I may at best
Float as you feel

Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past look distant and wrinkled
Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow
Letters of past look distant and wrinkled

(Just say...) Say you will follow me (follow me)
Invite me to your memory
(Just sing...) Sing again follow me (follow me)
That long forgotten song

Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words
Let me be all the words

Let me feel the words echo in comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay
Let me feel the words echo in comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay, unsay, unsay, unsay

Let me be all the words echoing comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay
Let me be all the words echoing comfort, comfort... comfort
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay, unsay, unsay, unsay
