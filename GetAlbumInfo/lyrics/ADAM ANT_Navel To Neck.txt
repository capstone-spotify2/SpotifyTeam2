Give me your hand here is mine
Better in the open
It's showtime let's call the tune

He's her baby boy
Navel to neck
Give me your mouth
I want to kiss you

Something deep inside me waits
You're giving up your daughters
But perfection is so dull

He's her baby boy
Navel to neck
Give me your mouth
I want to kiss you

That's the way the honey goes
Sweeter than a toy
From his tippy to his toes
He's her baby boy

That's the way the honey goes
Sweeter than a toy (hey, girl)
From his tippy to his toes
He's her baby boy (what did I say)

That's the way the honey goes
Sweeter than a toy
Come out to play, huh

Every inch of you I prize
Your body is a vision
And all the while look in your eyes
