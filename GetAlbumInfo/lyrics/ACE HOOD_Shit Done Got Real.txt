<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Mother fuck this industry
God bless my enemies
Too many lame niggas try'na speak
Till they find a beat, it don't bother me
But um
Any nigga can't rap get out, him ASAP
Talkin' about their trappin' again
Hopped in the booth
I've been the truth
Got proof
Guess who was the popular kid?
Ya it's me in a drop top with a Glock out
Pop shots in the back of your head
Aimin' at your esophagus
Don't count of survivin' the lead
{See I'm so pissed off to the litter}
{Like a flow with the riddle}
Let her ass cheek giggle
I'm a dog and I'm all in the middle
Fuck her, ran her, got balls all in 'em
What!?
Damn ma' can't call up a nigga
Bust that real fast for all of my niggas?
Gotta man? Well it's fuck that nigga
I'm good anywhere like I'm SunPassin' 'em
God damn my flow so amazin'
Ask renegades, they can quote that statement
Your bitch wanna have my babies
Nigga fuck you, pay me

<i>[Hook: Ace Hood]</i>
Ok it's money over them bitches
Coffins go to them snitches
Talkin' outta your ass
You're gonna need a little more than them stitches
Shit done got real, shit done got real
Shit done got real, shit done got real
Any given day you could be victimized
Just pray and hope one day you see them {heavenly} skies
Shit done got real, shit done got real
Shit done got real, shit done got real

<i>[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]</i>
I don't really think you niggas get it
I'm a decorate your face kind'a like an upholstery nigga
It's getting' kind'a real up in this motherfucker
I don't think you should really even approach me nigga
Lay down motherfucker you ain't heard what I said
Why you try'na play me closely nigga?
And now you wanna talk?
I'm already about to die while you stranglin' and really try'na choke me nigga
Tell a nigga that I cut a nigga till you see the white meat
But I don't really eat poultry nigga
Fuck it, it don't matter anyways
Cause you know you're about to lay up in a box kind'a cozy nigga
Look
It be gettin' kind'a bafflin' to me
When a dude be actin' like he know me nigga
And then I had to let it go
A couple of friendly reminders
{Till they get to} sink it in your meat slowly nigga
Hit a nigga for their shit
Make a nigga strip down, bare
Yogi nigga
I know it's unbelievable
Well bitch, ya betta believe it
{It's the ones} that know me nigga
Beat him like the boy omi nigga
If you watch, {whoopin'} like a ceremony nigga
And when I'm finished with him
Go and get his little bitch
Let her blow me nigga
I wanna cry for you friend
{Why ya try to front when} you've got so much to lose
Problem is that I'm the one to show you the truth
And talk about you when a nigga get in the booth
You niggas betta know the deal when I come through
Better learn or you gonna {feel}
{And by they way shit is lookin'}
Shit done got real
Shit done got real

<i>[Verse 3: Yelawolf]</i>
Shit done got real, Yela got a deal
Shit done got real, Yela got a deal
Hold up, wait a, minute
Did you say my name, and offer me to
Drive up in this motherfucker
Park it like a Buick Regal?
You in need of, usin' needles
Feel like you wanna shoot up this dope
Well let me swerve in, like syringe
To the veins of the game with another unique quote
You need a boat
You've done got deep
I'm so dirty, you need the soap
You need the hope
And a wish ain't nothin' like the real thing bitch
Say you need to cope
White bread, white bread
You need a loaf?
Spread butter on it
Dead my opponents with the lead
Yeah I'm goin'
Where am I goin'?
Could it be that Eminem only knows!?
When a synonym {talks} with a syllable
I mean comparable
It's kind'a like a {Motorola crossed with other Motorolas} talkin' to the world in a {parable}
Hella cold
Flow done put my family in Freda clothes
Extra vegetables, on a plate, and steak right next to those
I got to get it buddy
And if it's dirty and wet
I'll get it muddy
Fuck clean kicks
I done walked through green shit
And I did it public
So when I wipe my shoes on hip hop's welcome mat
And I leave a stain
Paybacks a bitch
That's my way of sayin'
Keep the change
