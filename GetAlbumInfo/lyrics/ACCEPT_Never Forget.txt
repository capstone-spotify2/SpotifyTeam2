I recall that fateful Tuesday
Tattooed in my mind
Left wandering, wounded, shocked and stunned

And although we've been disfigured
There's a toughness inside
We've had to learn to adapt and overcome

<i>[PRE-CHORUS:]</i>
Right now I tell you
The point of your knife no longer pierces my kind
Hear what I say
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger in time

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
(Let's Roll)
And another page is turned
(Let's Roll)
Still in our minds, the memory burns
It's not over yet
We will never forget

And so this has become our breastplate
Our protection, our shield
This resistance scraping from within

Strike back in retribution
You've crossed over the line
We'll fight fire with fire, and seek the sign

<i>[PRE-CHORUS]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[SOLO]</i>

(Let's Roll)
Yes another page is turned
(Let's Roll)
Still in our minds, the memory burns
(Let's Roll)
This open wound never heals
(Let's Roll)
No, this is not over yet
We will never forget
