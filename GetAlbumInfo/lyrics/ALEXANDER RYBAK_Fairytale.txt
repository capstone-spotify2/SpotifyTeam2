Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked, a girl I knew
She was mine, and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then itâs true

Iâm in love, with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Coz I donât care if I lose my mind
Iâm already cursed

Everyday, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else, could make me sadder
But no one else, could lift me high above

I donât know, what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, weâll get a brand new start

Iâm in love, with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Coz I donât care if I lose my mind
Iâm already cursed

Sheâs a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
Coz I donât care if I lose my mind
Iâm already cursed
