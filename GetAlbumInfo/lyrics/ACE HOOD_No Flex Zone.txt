No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go getter

Attention err'body, I'm gettin' sick and tired of gettin' modest
I'm gettin' plenty money, now they think I'm Illuminati
I'm the reason why they own a new Bugatti
I'm the one who give the flow to the game
Rap game, it will neva be the same
I done burf you niggas and then nervous you niggas
I'm the reason why you eva had a name
I'm the one who runnin' thangs in the south
You don't run a damn thing but yo mouth
Niggas talkin' outta terms till I pull up with the burn
Now the souls outside of yo house
Man, see me ride round the city with the top down
Bad bitches all out of heads down
Turnt for a nigga whole throat
And I'm a come and get it like a rebound
Bust it one time like a Greyhound
Ass in the air with ya face down
All this money on the floor, all this money on the table
It so much you would think Floyd May 'round
Why the broke boys always wanna flex?
Be the main ones, scare me with the checks
Niggas ball for a minute, blowin' bands on them bitches
Now they missin' tryna car you collect
Howl, you's a fraud, nigga, I'm at yo bottle
U a thot, bitch, you ain't no model
It's a no flex zone, couple gold chains on
I look like I just hit the lotto
Whole minute gone with a foreign bitch tourin'
Heard ya new shit, ah, bored
I'm in the studio, cookin' that greatness
Take time, have a lil bit of patience
I'm the one, no Neo with the Matrix
No flex, we the best hood nation
These niggas wanna claim they run it
Thou trippin' like ya took a vacation
Shout to boy AC and my dawg Choo-Choo
Where the lil homie project baby?
Dane gank I see ya Pompano caracida
Lot of deal, deer feel with my Haitians
Brower

Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains on, they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, why you have so many condoms with you?
I said, I'm a player, to be honest with you
Hublot, whoo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money, when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple, on the red carpet
And I'm flyer, than a nigga on a hang glider
4-5-6-7 chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, on the loud singing acapella
Chain clang, like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them
