<i>[Verse:]</i>
Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah!
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

People talk about me, baby
They say I'm doin' you wrong when I'm doin' you right
Well, don't you worry baby
Don't worry
'Cause I'm right here, I'm right here, right here, right here at home

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
And play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run

<i>[Verse:]</i>
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
And play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one

Lots of people keep talking about me, baby
They say I'm doin' you wrong when I'm doing you right
Well don't you worry, don't worry, baby, don't worry mama
'Cause I'm right here, I'm right here, right here, right here at home

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
And play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
And play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
