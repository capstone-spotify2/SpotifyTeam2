<i>[Chorus: Sean Kingston]</i>
I'm addicted to this life style
Blowin all my cash, in the strip club, trying to find me some ass
I'm addicted to this life style
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
I'm addicted to this life style,
Buying four cars, buying out the mall, Baby I'm a star
I'm addicted to this lifestyle
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
My conscience always say, Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go in the mall
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go buy it all, buy it all
Money ain't an issue, gotta let you know this is who I am

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Beach side view, white girl coupe, make believe top, thought you seen the roof
White flip-flops, designer shades Louis, big face blockers family guy Stewie
I'm so addicted to it, My bitch she shop and tourin,
Them niggas wish to do her just know she so manure
Who you lyin folks, she got her game up, 24 inches, Rover Range truck,
This is my life style, I live my life wow, four or five bitches, Pipe down,
Money cars and clothes, all a nigga know, dedicate the flow

<i>[Chorus: Sean Kingston]</i>
I'm addicted to this life style
Blowin all my cash, in the strip club, trying to find me some ass
I'm addicted to this life style
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
I'm addicted to this life style,
Buying four cars, buying out the mall, Baby I'm a star
I'm addicted to this lifestyle
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
My conscience always say, Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go in the mall
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go buy it all, buy it all
Money ain't an issue, gotta let you know this is who I am

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
And I'm addicted to this life, I would never ever change it,
Looking back on life I swear to God that it's amazing
Ridin in the flyest riff, now I'm eating casian,
Thousand dollar Louie couple hundred for the fragrant,
Mamma I made it, yes I did,
Used to live with seven, three bed crib
But now I got my own and now I'm rottin chrome,
These women love the money, so they becoming showns,
I see these niggas hatin, but they can't be what I'm on,
Give my chic a couple stacks then I ship her off to Rome,
So bye-bye you, hit the mall and buy it all baby it's the truth

<i>[Chorus: Sean Kingston]</i>
I'm addicted to this life style
Blowin all my cash, in the strip club, trying to find me some ass
I'm addicted to this life style
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
I'm addicted to this life style
Buying four cars, buying out the mall, Baby I'm a star
I'm addicted to this lifestyle
Shorty I can't change cause that's just who I am
My conscience always say, Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go in the mall
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go buy it all, buy it all
Money ain't an issue, gotta let you know this is who I am
