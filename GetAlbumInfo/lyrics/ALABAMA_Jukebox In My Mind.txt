In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind.

I don't need no quarters, don't need any dime
You filled it up forever
When you said good-bye
Heaven knows I love old melodies
They were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playin' on my mind
Are drivin' me insane.

In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind.

Song by song, those melodies
Were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playin' on my mind
Are drivin' me insane;

In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind.
