A feeling, a presence,
Time is of the essence,
A fear that you'll be left alone.
A warning, a presage,
Delivery of a message,
It's all there in the unknown.

Alerting, averting
It's all disconcerting,
Shots ring out from afar.
Swerving, observing,
The sound is a piercing screech
Of a speeding car.

It's your final journey!
Destination unknown...
On your final journey
You'll be travelling alone!

A pitching and rolling,
Sensation controlling,
You strike while the iron's aglow.
Sensing the danger,
One look from a stranger
Just passing somehow you know.

Urgent, urgent,
Somehow it's all converging,
Your instincts tell you to run
Away from the blackness,
The fear and the madness,
Onwards into the sun.
