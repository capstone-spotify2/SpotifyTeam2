She said, I don't usually dance this close to strangers
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless
But when you smile that way I'm not so sure you are

I said, I don't usually come here for the dancin'
You can tell that by the way I move
When I saw you I thought that it was hopeless
But I just had to ask you for a dance or two

Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl, we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on earth I think we've found it 
If this ain't love we're dancin' all around it

The music stopped and we're still holding each other
This feels like the beginning of forever
Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on earth I think we've found it 
If this ain't love we're dancin' all around it
If this ain't love we're dancin' all around it

She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers...
