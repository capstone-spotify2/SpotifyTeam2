Release me 
Release my body 
I know it's wrong 
So why am I with you now 
I say release me 
'Cause I'm not able to 
Convince myself 
That I'm better off without you 

Yeah, it's perfectly clear 
That love's not what you need 
I tell you I don't care 
But I don't want to 
Anything that you say 
I hear myself agree 
And I don't recognize 
What I've turned into 

I don't know why I want you so 
'Cause I don't need the heartbreak 
I don't know what addictive hold 
You have on me I can't shake 
No, I'm not in control 
So let me go 

Release me 
Release my body 
I know it's wrong 
So why do I keep coming back 
I say release me 
'Cause I'm not able to 
Convince myself 
That I'm better off without you 

I could sleep by myself 
I would burn me alive 
Find me somebody else 
But I don't want to 
Try to leave out the love 
That goes againt the grain 
But I can rationalize it 
If I have to 

I don't know why I want you so 
'Cause I don't need the heart break 
I don't know what addictive hold 
You have on me I can't shake 
No, I'm not in control 
So let me go 

Release me 
Release my body 
I know it's wrong 
So why do I keep coming back 
I say release me 
'Cause I'm not able to 
Convince myself 
That I'm better off without you
