Itâs the fact that was real ill
And what we had was a real deal
You say that you donât wanna go back but I know in your heart that you still will
Warring caused the thunder
This bridge is broken thereâs water under it
Itâs crazy itâs come to this you say no love lost but of course thereâs tons of it

My eyes are opening
Inside this broken thing
Heavy on me
Across my mind

I was thinking a break was for the best while living my life like a bachelor 
Never realized that I caused a mess because the whole time acting up
You made a lasting impression feel like weâre past the essence
Trying to get her back again I need closure to these unanswered questions

What we gonna be is this just a fantasy will we be together forever youâre in my mind any weather
Is this now or for forever you hold my hand were together but weâre separate this is love

Ignite the fire the fear and crash into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it
Ignite the fire the fear and dance into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it

My eyes are opening
Inside this broken thing
Heavy on me
Across my mind

What we gonna be is this just a fantasy will we be together forever youâre in my mind any weather
Is this now or for forever you hold my hand were together but weâre separate this is love

Ignite the fire the fear and crash into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it
Ignite the fire the fear and dance into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it

It is what it is but then itâs not what it can be
I'm down on my knees and singing oh lord please
It is what it is but then itâs not what it can be
Iâm down on my knees 

Ignite the fire the fear and crash into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it
Ignite the fire the fear and dance into the light
It hurts but itâs worth it, it hurts but itâs worth it

This time I'm frozen in exposed I'm caving in
