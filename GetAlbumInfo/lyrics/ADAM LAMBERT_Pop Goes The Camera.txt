I got drive so I'll survive in Hollywood where I will thrive
I'll arrive I'll take a dive into the pool into the hive
I won't break I'm what it takes I'll make my mark like an earthquake
Raise the stakes I'm wide awake be in your sight 'til your head aches
Fascination, saturation
Stars are just like us
Validation, exploitation
All cause a big fuss
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes of fame
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes of fame
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes of fame
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
Cross promotion, cross the ocean, I'll make bank off their devotion
Drink the potions cause commotions got them feeling strong emotions
I'll inspire they'll admire, won't turn on me cause i got fire
Fame expires, I'll retire but I'll hold on down to the wire
Fascination, saturation
Stars are just like us
Validation, exploitation
All cause a big fuss
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes of fame
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
Look at me, look at me in a magazine
Look at me, look at me in a magazine
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
I've been told each flash steals your soul
Every celebrity knows
Fame takes it's toll
Fascination, saturation
Stars are just like us
Validation, exploitation
All cause a big fuss
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes of fame
Pop, pop goes the camera
Fifteen minutes right now
Look at me, look at me in a magazine
Look at me, look at me in a magazine
