<i>[Mark:]</i>
You said you need a groom this evening 
I told you I'm leaving 
Till you begged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me 
You promised to please me 
Then you take it away 

<i>[Mark:]</i>
The fire is fading baby stoke it up 
And let it roll up your sleeves 
Why canât you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breath 

<i>[All:]</i>
If you canât wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

<i>[Mark:]</i>
Let it in

<i>[Paul:]</i>
You used to keep me up till the morning 
Keeping me warm untill I had to be gone 
And now you canât find a room in your head 
You see you got out of bed 
Well that my coffee ain't on 

<i>[Paul:]</i>
The door was open do you locked it up 
And then you threw out the key 
Why canât you tell me that we're breaking up 
That I need space to breath 

<i>[All:]</i>
If you canât wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

<i>[All:]</i>
Let it out      
Let it in 
I canât wait 
Let it out      
Let it in 
I canât wait  

<i>[All:]</i>
If you canât wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

<i>[All:]</i>
Let it out      
Let it in 
I canât wait 

<i>[All:]</i>
If you canât wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

<i>[Mark:]</i>
Let it out 

<i>[Paul:]</i>
No I canât wait 
Till you let me in 
I canât wait 

<i>[Mark:]</i>
No I canât wait 
You got to let it out
