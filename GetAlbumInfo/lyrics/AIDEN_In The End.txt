When the walls came tumbling down
Were you there to save me?
The cemetery gates cemetery gates
Iâm still alive.

Be still the voice inside my head
Plan nine, walk among the dead
Iâm insane.

In the eyes of recognition
I can feel the darkness,
The cemetery gates cemetery gates
Iâm still alive.

In the end, we fall will you all shine?

You fall Iâll shine
You fall Iâm still alive
You fall Iâll shine
You fall Iâm still alive

In the end We Fallâ¦
Will you all shine?
