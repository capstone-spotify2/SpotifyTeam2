<i>[Intro:]</i>
Smell the murder in the air, uh oh

I swear to God I'm killing niggas

<i>[Hook:]</i>

You just all talk, you just all hype
Claim you be with killers, heard it's all lies

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I'm talking crack your melons, rebels on some felon shit
Talking dirty burners, fuck the judge I'm thugging bitch
Money, money, money, money, all I'm working with

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Ok now, word on my mama, nigga try me he gon' die tonight
Handle you and maybe out of sight before them siren lights
Murder only mind state, show up at your mom's place
Yeen' about that life, bodies found on your landscape
Niggas want problems, get served like a warrant
Looking for me bitch, I'm whipping a foreign
Drop with that clip and I'm ready for war
Niggas is bitches and most of them flaw
Talking that shit that they not really bout'
Loving they hoes, they be digging their mouth
Bringing them in, kicking them out
Dicking them down, that's what I'm bout'
Hate when niggas be talking talk, that's until the chopper bust
That's until the suits are black, bless your soul in God we trust
Yeen' about that life, pills, purple, white
Niggas threaten mine, he might see the light

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Smell the murder in the air, uh oh
Them boys letting choppers go
I swear to God I'm killing niggas
Somebody plan a funeral
