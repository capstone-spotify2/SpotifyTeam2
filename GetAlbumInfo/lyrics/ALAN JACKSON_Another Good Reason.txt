I woke up the other night
Lyin' on the floor
Right beside someone
I've never seen before
She said, my name's Juliet
Romeo you ain't
That's another good reason not to drink

That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this
I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink

I can't go see my best friend
An' he said stay away
Just because of what I said
On his wedding day
He oughta call a Sherman
'Cause she looks just like a tank
That's another good reason not to drink

That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this
I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink

I'm gonna sue to city
About that policeman
Last night as I left the bar
He stepped right on my hand
He said, are you drunk or blind?
I said, let me think
That's another good reason not to drink

That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this
I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
Ooh

That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this
I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason
Baby, let me in I'm freezin'
Another good reason not to drink
