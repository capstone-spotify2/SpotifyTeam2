I used to love a girl
Sometimes I still think I do
Thinking about her makes me a little crazy (crazy)
She used to be my world
How could we be split in two
We were just like peas in a pod (a pod, a pod)

I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real

So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go

I tried to play the field
Lost my share in one a few
I never really hit one out the park
No, I guess I wasn't healed
Trying to forget the truth
Life without you left me with a scar

I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real

So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go

So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go

Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
I gotta let her go

Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
