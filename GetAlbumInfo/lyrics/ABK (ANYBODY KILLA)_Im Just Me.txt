All this time I spend just writing down
These thoughts that build in my head
I try to get away but they keep chasing me down
They tell me set them free
So this is how I release
By giving everything to you
So you can witness whatâs in me

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
All I am is who you see (who you see)
All I give is what you really need (what you believe)
Iâm just me, Iâm just me
Iâm just me, Iâm just me
Yeahhhhhh

I just donât understand why these feeling take control over me
Is it just because Iâm weak or is my mind all that they need
Cause when I close my eyes is when they usually try to speak
And when I awake I just grab my pen because thatâs how I spread my wings

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

Is your eyes wide open, do you feel like you canât keep copin
Do you believe in what you see
All these words that have been spoken keep some alive
And always searchin because they believe in what they see

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
