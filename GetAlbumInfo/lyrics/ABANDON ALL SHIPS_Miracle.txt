Love was meant to be durable
But now my broken heart's incurable
To her I feel so invincible
I need a miracle

Walk away and know you're never alone
Your lips speak the words to my heart are unknown
You think you own me step down from your throne
Is this how it ends? Your true colours have shown

I search for the good in your lies
How can I compromise
The feelings I keep down inside

And I don't know why
I feel so alive
I made up my mind
It's time
This is goodbye

Love was meant to be durable

And I don't know why
I feel so alive
This is goodbye

Love was meant to be durable
But now my broken hearts incurable
To her I feel so invincible
I need a miracle
