Alcohol was a friend of mine
It almost got me dead
I crashed some cars, got into fights
Some things I now regret 

I've been told I've got nine lives
Or maybe even ten
Now I've changed my ways, my soul's restored
I'm better now than then 

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And that's alright
That's alright with me

Temptin'd fates, not what I want to do
I'll soon enough be dead
And all that glitters isn't always gold
You know I've heard it said

I've taken chances, I crossed the line
I lost my faith in love
Now the road is clear
My aim is true, with help from above

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And that's alright
That's alright with me 

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And I can't fly
I won't fly away 

You know I won't fly away
We got to find our own way
But I don't know if I'll make it to Heaven
Just open the gates of Hell

Daddy, have you ever seen an angel?
Sure baby
Well, what was it like?
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen

Just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And that's alright
That's alright with me

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And I can't fly
I won't fly away

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And that's alright
That's alright with me

We're just below
A little lower than the angels
And I can't fly
I won't fly away

We're just a little below
A little lower than the angels
And that's alright
That's alright with me

We're just a little below
