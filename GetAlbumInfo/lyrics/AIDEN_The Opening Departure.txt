Close your eyes
The rain won't wash away
Close your eyes
The rain won't wash away

This time our sins are complete
The rush to defeat
But I'll stay, if you promise
Always, someday will be our day

Close your eyes
The rain won't wash away
Close your eyes
The rain won't wash away

This time we have to believe
And so beautifully we'll sing "Stay
if you promise, always, someday will be our day"
Someday will be our day
I said now, someday will be our day
