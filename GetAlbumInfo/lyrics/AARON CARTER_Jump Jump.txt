<i>[Verse 1]</i>
I got a friend and I may just get him
Ready and a push with a mic in my right hand
Move you, groove you
Get something to dance to, if you want to
Step outside, come along, let's ride
Don't listen to the talk, take a walk on the wild side
Thinkin', talkin', clockin', everybody's shockin', and rockin

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Cause you know and I know
that we rule the dance floor
If the DJ's too slow-slow
I guess that it's a no-no, no-no
If I say...

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Jump jump to say how high
Jump jump to the left to the right
Jump jump and turn around
Jump jump and touch the ground
<i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Ain't gonna mix with the latest craze
Everybody's thinking it's just a phase
But they don't about going out, showing out, and hanging out
And don't know the rules about...

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Rap:]</i>
Say boomity boom boom, boombastick
Fun fun fun, funtastick
Swing the nation
Cause a sensation
Or good vibration
??
Somebody, anybody, everybody
SCREAM!

Yo, Aaron, where you at, man?

<i>[Chorus x2, fade out]</i>
