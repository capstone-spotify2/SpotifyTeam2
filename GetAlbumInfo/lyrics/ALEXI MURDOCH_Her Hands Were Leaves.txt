I see my brother, he is walking in the sun
His back is bare, he carries no burden for anyone
I see the island, a silver line
Brother, how you shine

And all around the light
And all around the light

Now I see my father, he's so small against the sky
The child, the tree, the shadow is on his eye
He doesn't know who he's supposed to be
Father, you are free

And all around the light
And all around the light

Now I hear my mother, she is crying on the stair
Her hands are leaves, the light is in her hair
And as she prays, she thinks that no one heard
Mother, you are a bird
Mother, you are a bird

And all around the light
And all around the light
And all around the light
Now all around the light
