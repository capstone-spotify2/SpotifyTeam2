Listen close
I'm not a puppet in your role play
You should know
I cut the strings and do it my way

You can't tell me no
But you know I need not follow
I'm letting go
You won't phase me anymore

I won't apologize
About what I'm about to say, no
I won't back down, you know
It makes me want to show

That I'm invincible
And you told me you're invincible
And I do this on my own

I'm going up, up, up, yeah
With or without you
Up, up, up to stay
I'm going up, up, up, yeah
I don't need you
You won't get in my way

Yeah, I would always say
You gotta walk the talk you're speaking
(You gotta walk the talk you say)

It's swatter day
I'll be a big girl
Now I'm leaving
Ow

You can't tell me no
But you know I need not follow
I'm letting go
You won't phase me anymore

I won't apologize
About what I'm about to say, no
I won't back down, you know
It makes me want to show

That I'm invincible
And you told me you're invincible
And I do this on my own

I'm going up, up, up, yeah
With or without you
Up, up, up to stay
I'm going up, up, up, yeah
I don't need you
You won't get in my way

You know I won't stop
You're just a road block
You know I won't stop

The road is all mine
It's mine, I see it just fine
All I need is one night

Listen close
I'm not a puppet in your role play
So listen close
I cut the strings and
I'm gonna do it my way

I'm going up, up, up, yeah
With or without you
Up, up, up to stay
I'm going up, up, up, yeah
I don't need you
You won't get in my way
(You won't get in my way)

I'm going up, up, up, yeah
With or without you
Up, up, up to stay
I'm going up, up, up, yeah
I don't need you
You won't get in my way

I'm going up
You know I won't stop
You're just a road block
You know I won't stop

The road is all mine
It's mine, I see it just fine
All I need is one night
