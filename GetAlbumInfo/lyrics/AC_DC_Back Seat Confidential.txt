Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers on the automobile floor

What's that (social<i>[?]</i>) sound?
Thing's goin' down
Look at what's goin' round

Back seat confidential

Said to buy a rubber (at/by) the cigarette stand
Dying to get it off so that I can get in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She say what you gonna do 'bout my protection?
All right mama, gotta listen to me
Last chance thrill it's half past three
Huggin' and kissin' will be real nice
Every man's got his price

What's that (social<i>[?]</i>) sound?
Something's goin' down
There's passion 'round

Back seat confidential

Wha - ooh

Old man's car (on/it's) a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers in the backseat floor

What's that (social<i>[?]</i>) sound?
Somethin's goin' down
There's passion 'round

Around!
