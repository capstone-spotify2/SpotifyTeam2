I never should've left you, I'll do anything to get you
Back in my heart, back in my life now
I thought my wish was granted when I saw you standing
Waiting for me, waiting for me here

Then when you came a little closer I see your anger isn't over
I, oh I am sorry

Unforgiven, unforgiven
I'm unforgiven by you
I was wrong, now I know that I just can't take it back
I'm unforgiven by you

By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you

Even if we want this, there's too much under this bridge
Waiting for us, to destroy us here
'Cause when you came a little closer I see your anger isn't over
I, oh I am sorry

Unforgiven, unforgiven
I'm unforgiven by you
I was wrong, now I know that I just can't take it back
I'm unforgiven by you

By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you

As hard as it is for me to admit
The damage is done and I am the one
The one...

Unforgiven, unforgiven
I'm unforgiven by you
Unforgiven, unforgiven
I'm unforgiven by you

By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you, you, you, you
By you
