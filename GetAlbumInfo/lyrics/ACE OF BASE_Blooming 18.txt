Reality reality reality is always

You tattoes yourself like a piece of art
You've already broken your mother's heart
When I was your age, working my ass off
Your generation's soft

Reality is auch a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The bearely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's keeping her from searching

You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye your hair, dad's gonna wash it out
Come on wash your mouth

Reality is always...
What's hiding in the shadow

Reality reality reality is always

Reality is always...
