Ladies can be captains and ladies can be chiefs
just like glorious Amazons, Ann Bonny, Mary Read
ladies can be captains and ladies can be chiefs
this stuff I'm talking buddy-bob
don't give me any grief

5 Guns West

I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna take a whirl with a big tough girl
I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna spend my life with a big tough wife

a woman's wrath hath no man, and this all men must fear
these were ladies from hell, carving crimson careers
ladies can be captains and ladies can be chiefs
this stuff I'm talking buddy-bob
don't give me any grief

5 Guns West

I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna spend my day in a big tough way
I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna take a whirl with a big tough girl

5 Guns West

I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna spend my life with a big tough wife
I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna take a whirl with a big tough girl
I'm a big tough man and my name is Stan
gonna take a ride with my big tough bride
I'm a big tough man with a big tough plan
gonna spend my day in a big tough way
