<i>[Intro:]</i>
You don't want to get me started ho
You don't want to get me started ho
Ace Hood
We the best, YMCMB

<i>[Hook: Ace Hood]</i>
My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake
Was on the block every night, was on the block every day
I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame
I kept it real from the joint and that's just how I remain
Don't get me started, don't get me started
My nigga, my nigga don't get me started, don't get me started
My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded
Cause a nigga wanna think it's sweet then try me
Don't get me started, don't get me started

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Ok now clique full of niggas with tempers
Clique full of niggas and killas
When they cut me I don't pay them
With the two them nigga eyes remember
I'm the same lil nigga from the block ho
And I drive still walk with the Glock on
I'm about that cream, guaplage on
Don't get me started up ho
I come to whip in the Phantom
Y'all niggas really can't stand it
Them hoes really be jocking
Diamonds that got them watching
Say Ace ain't getting' no money
Pussy, I beg your pardon
You don't wanna get me started
You don't wanna see how I'm ballin'
Ok ok, what it look like?
Well that good thing got and it's good night
With a bad bitch, she's so thick
She rolling, I know this
And her neck gon' froze, better know that
Act up, I smell like a Kodak
And these niggas these niggas
These niggas these niggas
These niggas these niggas won't hold back

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
Ok them pussy niggas be hating
Focus on what I'm making
Came through in tha Phantom
Them pussy niggas can't take it
Spit big bread on my chain
Still on stroke with your main
I'm rich nigga like yea nigga
They hoping I stay the same
They say I changed when I got fame
Bitch niggas, they complain
Flat black in that 2 door
Nigga must think he Bruce Wayne
I'm like damn hood what it be like?
Hold 'em down as your knee lights
New bitch like every day
Swear to God you won't see her twice
That purple that got me leaning
They don't wanna get me started
Come on this hook, no phonics
Introduce this shit and go retarded
Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that's standing tall; two chain
