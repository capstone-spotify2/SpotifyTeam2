I got way too many enemies...got a nigga paranoid

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Everyday I wake I pray dear Lord protect my soul
I got way too many enemies, these niggas ain't a friend of me, Lord
HEY
Blessings all around me, I got shooters on my line
I got way too many enemies, these niggas ain't a friend of me, Lord

Got a lawyer on my phone, I've been stressed all day
I got homies doing life, friends changed, I'm ashamed
I got bands in the safe; bail money just in case
No conceals on my weapons; pray I do not catch a case
Gotta protect my Junior, gotta protect my daughter
Gotta make it back home, my kids expectin' their father
Know ima ride for my brother, I would die for my momma
I'm gon' stand up in court and then tell a lie to your honor
I had to struggle my nigga, where were you then?
I got the money and now they wanna be friends (Where were you?)
I never fucked with you, you know I never did
Im tryna chill on behalf of my two kids

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Everyday I wake I pray dear Lord protect my soul
I got way too many enemies, these niggas ain't a friend of me, Lord
HEY
Blessings all around me, I got shooters on my line
I got way too many enemies, these niggas ain't a friend of me, Lord
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH HEY

Liquor on my breath, I got the shooters ridin' passenger
Treat the beef like Benihana; cook it right in front of ya
I got paranoia pussy niggas so disloyal
When they act like they are for ya just to make my blood boil
Motherfuck all you niggas, motherfuck all you bitches
Just a bunch of them devils out here with spiteful intentions
Against the world, with middle fingers
Blunt in my mouth watch what you say
Get put in danger its in my nature I see
Niggas will pray that you fail, act like they wishing you well
God damn you was my nigga for real, how did we ever get here?
You were supposed to be whippin' that Bentley you with me
You with me from city to city but now that I made it, I'm famous
You say that I'm chaning but why so much hate
