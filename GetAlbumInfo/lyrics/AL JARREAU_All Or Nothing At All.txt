Everyday we go through
I do something that will please you baby
And I know having you around
Well, just keeps me grounded

If I get jealous, if I act like a fool
It's an overreaction to loving you

I want it all or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

All other men try for you
They won't give you what I do now, baby
I won't share, want you to myself
So I'll keep trying

Gonna make my lovin' the best it can be
'Cause I need your devotion desperately

All or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

Just tell me now that there's no other man
'Cause I don't want my heart broken up again
And when you say that you'll never let go
Only then will I know, woah

I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all
Lay your love on the line
Right now, I need you to
Lay your love on the line,baby

I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

All or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

All or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all
