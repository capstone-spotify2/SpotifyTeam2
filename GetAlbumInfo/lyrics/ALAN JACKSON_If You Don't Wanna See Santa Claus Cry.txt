Well I'm making out my list 
For ole St. Nick tonight 
But I'm afraid what I want this year 
Can't be had 

But Santa he's the kind 
When he makes up his mind 
Wishes can come true 
And I bet my Christmas stockin'
If my wish don't come knockin'
He's gonna be blue 

So baby come home 
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry 
He can't see where he's going 
When it's snowing 
If there tears in his eyes 

And don't you know his ho ho ho will be 
A sad sad sigh 
So baby come back to me 
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry

And don't you know his ho ho ho will be 
A sad sad sigh 
So baby come home to me 
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry 

So baby come back to me 
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry...
