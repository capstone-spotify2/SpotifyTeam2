Alone out in the city
On the wrong dark side of town
Man she's lookin' pretty
And the sun is goin' down

I said who's that knockin' at my door
Wearing soft silk lingerie
You got your look from a book at a weekend sale
And now you wanna play

I said what's up baby?
Why don't you come inside?
The big bad wolf is feelin' good
He's gonna make you feel alive

Let's ride like dogs in heat
Let's ride just you and me
Let's ride in between the sheets
And never stop till the sun comes up
Let's ride

Well we rode all through the night
Like we never had before
Sweat poured from our bodies
As the bed bounced off the floor

She said don't stop honey, take me there
Do it to me all night long
I said I ain't gonna stop till I blow the lot
So you better keep holding on
She said harder baby
Don't ever slow down
I said don't worry honey I'm the big bad wolf
And I ain't gonna let you down

Let's ride like dogs in heat
Let's ride just you and me
Let's ride in between the sheets
And never stop till' the sun comes up
Let's ride

What the hell you waiting for c'mon baby
Let's ride like dogs in heat
Let's ride just you and me
Let's ride in between the sheets
And never stop till' the sun comes up
Let's ride, ride
Let's ride, ride
We're gonna ride, ride
C'mon let's ride, ride
Oh yeah we're gonna ride, ride

C'mon baby
C'mon girl
C'mon baby
What are you waitin' for?
