There's snow on the mountain
And fog in the street
Flickering candles in the room
Hear the church bell ring
See the children playing
I feel their pure delight
And the snow is falling
Taking me away
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Reflecting the sound of my heart
It's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Don't try to tear me apart - cold winter dreams
Find myself in peace
Warm from underneath
Wish you would be here
In this magic scene
I've escaped from reality
Dancing in the snow
Cold blue sky gives me
The innocence I need
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Freezing the heat in my heart
It's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Chill me and tear me apart - cold winter dreams
The world seems so clear
Like a wonderful diamond
Can't imagine there's meanness
Can't imagine one lie
But when I'm dead and gone
And snow's pouring down
I'm buried and covered
Peaceful under millions of stars
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Reflecting the sound of my heart
It's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Don't try to tear me apart - cold winter dreams
