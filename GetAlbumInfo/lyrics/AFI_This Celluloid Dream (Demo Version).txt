Calling tears from deep inside, oh, you're so exquisite.
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes.
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit
All midnight eyes, read "vacancy."

Twisting,
twisting.

To the lovely dancing lights, I begged, "May I cut in?"
But they never stopped, playing their song.
Of a joyous song they sing, I've heard whispers.
On a freezing note, I resonate.

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end,
just like a memory, it twists me.
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end,
twist.. twisting me.

You land as lightly, as the new snow,
(Cinematic)
onto the melting boy.
(and melt away)
You light as gently, you're so.
(Cinematic)
Bathed in your radiance, I melt.

Oh.

In the glitter, in the dark, sunk into velvet,
Praying this will never end.
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor,
I realized I never began.

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end,
just like a memory, it twists me.
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end,
twist.. twisting me.

You land as lightly, as the new snow,
(Cinematic)
onto the melting boy.
(and melt away)
You light as gently, you're so.
(Cinematic)
Bathed in your radiance, I melt.

All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to Grey.
All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to Grey.
(All Grey)
All the colors,
(All Grey)
upon leaving,
(All Grey)
all will turn to Grey.
(All Grey)
All the colours,
(All Grey)
upon leaving
(All Grey)
all will turn to Grey.
Grey.

Twisting me

You land as lightly, as the new snow,
(Cinematic)
onto the melting boy.
(and melt away)
light as gently, you're so.
(Cinematic)
Bathed in your radiance.

You land as lightly, as the new snow,
(Cinematic)
onto the melting boy.
(and melt away)
You light as gently, you're so.
(Cinematic)
Bathed in your radiance, I melt.
