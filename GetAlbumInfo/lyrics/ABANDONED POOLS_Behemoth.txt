Strong arm man
You do what you want to
You poke my eye
You do what you want to
You behemoth
You go where you want to
You've been stalking me around
You go where you want to
Till you come undone
So tragically
Killing your time
So tragically

Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine

When you dream
You are none the wiser
When you shut your eyes
You are none the wiser
Till you come undone
So carelessly
Killing your time
So carelessly

Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine

Don't look down
Where you go I go
Slow it down
Where you go I go too

Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine
