Early morning
Eight o'clock precise
I see the lonely August sun arise

Say you know
You will
Move me like you do

Out on the fields...
I'm waiting the whole night through
Early morning, early morning, yeah

Ran the whole way
Down to the tracks
Through the doorway
Then a last look back

Say you know
You will
Save me like you do

Out on the fields...
I've waited the whole night through
Early morning, early morning, yeah

I climbed all the stairways
To find the rooftop clear
Got the shotgun lying with me here
Say you know
You will
Move me like you do

Out on the fields...
You know how it feels, yeah
Early morning, early morning, yeah

Early morning
Eight o'clock precise
