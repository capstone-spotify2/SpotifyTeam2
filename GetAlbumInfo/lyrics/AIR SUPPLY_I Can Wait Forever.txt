When you say, I miss the things you do
I just want to get back close again to you
But for now, your voice is near enough
How I miss you and I miss your love

And though, all the days that pass me by so slow
All the emptiness inside me flows
All around and there's no way out
I'm just thinking so much of you, there was never any doubt

I can wait forever
If you say you'll be there too
I can wait forever if you will
I know it's worth it all, to spend my life alone with you

When it looked as though my life was wrong
You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong
I'll be here, when hope is out of sight
I just wish that I was next to you tonight

And though, I'll be reaching for you even though
You'll be somewhere else, my love will go
Like a bird on it's way back home
I could never let you go, and I just want you to know

I can wait forever
If you say you'll be there too
I can wait forever if you will
I know it's worth it all, to spend my life alone with you

I can wait forever
If you say you'll be there too
I can wait forever if you will
I know it's worth it all, to spend my life alone

I can wait forever
If you say you'll be there too
I can wait forever if you will
I can wait forever more, I can wait forever
