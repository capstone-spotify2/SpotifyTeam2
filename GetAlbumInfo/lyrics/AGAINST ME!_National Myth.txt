All your glorious battles, what did they amount to, what did they prove? 
All for your pride of country, all for your sacred democracy, rival national myths. 
All for your rich ancestry of warmongers, you hailed as heroes. 
Don't believe in your jingoistic pride, that fuels your imperialistic genocide. 

When all I cry for is Anarchy. 
When all I plea for is to be free. 
Their slavery will never get the best of me. 
Their restrictions will never imprison me. 
Their poisons will never disable me. 
Love is the force that binds me. 

A better world will emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past. 
Considering tens of millions lost their lives in conflict, is that too much to ask? 
Wars of religion, nationalism, made all the more devastating by advances in perverted science. 
Led the innocent to early deaths, soldiers to shallow graves. How can you sleep at night? 

When all I cry for is to be free. 
When all I plea for is Anarchy. 
Their slavery will never get the best of me. 
Their restrictions will never imprison me. 
Their poisons will never disable me. 
Love is the force that drives me. 
Hatred will never overtake me.
