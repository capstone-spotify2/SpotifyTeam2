Christ the Lord is risen today
Hallelujah
Sons of man and angels say
Hallelujah
Raise your joys and triumphs high
Hallelujah
Sing ye heavens and earth reply

Loves redeeming work is done
Hallelujah
Fought the fight the battle won
Hallelujah
Death in vain forbid Him rise
Hallelujah
Christ has opened paradise

Hallelujah, He is risen
Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven
Now we have power over the grave
Christ the Lord is risen today

Lives again our Glorious King
Hallelujah
Where o death is now thy sting
Hallelujah
Dying once our souls to save
Hallelujah
Where thy victory o grave?

Hallelujah, He is risen
Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven
Now we have power over the grave
Christ the Lord is risen today

All creation sang
Hallelujah, the King is risen
Glory to the name of the Risen Lord
Let all the earth proclaim
Hallelujah, our sins forgiven
Glory to Your name forevermore

Hallelujah, He is risen
Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven
Now we have power over the grave
Christ the Lord is risen today
We have power over the grave
Christ the Lord is risen today
