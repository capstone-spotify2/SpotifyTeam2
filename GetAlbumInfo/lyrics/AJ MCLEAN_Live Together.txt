I've been through the fire breathing
Took my time so I ain't leaving
And Lord you know I need to be saved
I sure ain't saving myself

We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, we should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Die die alone

I've seen so much hate and breathing
We should take a break from hating
And Lord you know we need to be saved
(Oh yes)
Cause we sure ain't saving ourselves

We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, we should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Die die alone

<i>[Jordan James:]</i>
Yo
We've got it all
We nothing but puzzle pieces
Every one of us need this
I'm tired
I don't believe this
Why racism still exists
Don't matter, Catholic or Christian
Buddhist, Jewish, or Muslim
Or twenty dozen some others
I wonder
Ain't Martin Luther bring some truth to this situation?
Cause Jefferson got us looking for justice and we waiting
People still killing
But we got no Batman and Robin
They grabbin' bats man and robbin' each other over their problems
But look
We broke as hell
Some hopeless and go to jail
Murdering, bombing countries like we ain't afraid of hell
Some already know it well
Live it like show and tell
Bragging about selling drugs
I'm calling that blow and tell
And we searching for meaning
Grabbin' books and we reading
Just take a look at that man in the mirror before you leave and see him for what he is
Cause generations of kids is looking up to us thinking like
"This is the way we live?"
Damn

We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, we should all, all live together
Or die alone
We should all, all live together
Die die alone

All live together
Die die alone
