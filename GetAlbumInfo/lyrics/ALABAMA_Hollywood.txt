Atlanta, Georgia made her the cotton queen
L.A. bound she had visions of the silver screen
But Hollywood ain't nothing but glamour and lights
To a blue eyed, blonde with stars in her eyes.

Her days are long, but hard her nights are longer yet
Trying to find a part that will make her the queen of sex
She's realizing what it's all about
From too many nights upon the casting couch.

Hollywood, parties and thrills
The mansion in her mind is somehwere in Beverly Hills
She's been discovered too many times
Standing on the corner of Hollywood and Vine.

She makes her entrance now
A days through the swinging doors
She found her stage on a hardwood bar room floor
But it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fall
Her biggest fan's the man tonight she'll give her all.

The dream is dying of her name on the marquee
The folks back home wonder
What happened to their queen
The morning paper's told it in black and white
Calling it another Hollywood suicide.

Hollywood, parties and thrills
The mansion in her mind is somewhere in Beverly Hills
She's been discovered too many times
Standing on the corner of Hollywood and Vine...
