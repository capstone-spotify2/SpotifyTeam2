You took my guitar you took my amp
You picked the wrong day you picked the wrong man
Gonna storm your office gonna kick down your door
Cause I'm not takin the shit no more yeah

With the devil at my side
Guitar on my back
I will ride
To hell hell hell and back
Yeah stand and deliver
I'm gonna stand and deliver

I'm gonna cause trouble gonna kick up the town
Cause I'm not leavin this one down
See me burnin up like a wild fire
You can't put me out cause I'm not for hire

With the devil at my side
Guitar on my back
I will ride
To hell hell hell and back
Yeah stand and deliver
I'm gonna stand and deliver

Alright!

All I got is a bottle of wine
Which I got for my latest crime
Yeah the amps are loud the lights are bright
Gonna be a hell of a show tonight

With the devil at my side
Guitar on my back
I will ride
To hell hell hell and back
Yeah stand and deliver
I'm gonna stand and deliver
