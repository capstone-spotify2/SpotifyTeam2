I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

(And ooh yeah, now)
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day,
You know it's always been that way

(Ooh yeah, now)
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop (ooh, ya'll)
The girl is right on time now (come on)

Her loving arms are there to greet me,
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

(One woman's making my home)
One women's making my home
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong.

(One woman's making my home)
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong

(One woman's making my home)
Baby baby baby...
