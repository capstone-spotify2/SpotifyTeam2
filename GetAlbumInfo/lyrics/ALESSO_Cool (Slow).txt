I saw stars on the pavement
Californian dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see

You said, "It's all yours if you take it there"
I said, "I can't do it alone, I swear"
You said, "It's all yours
It's all yours when you smile"

It's only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream it from the roof
I'm trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it ('bout it)

Before you I was always lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one that rescued me

You said, "It's all yours if you take it there"
I said, "I can't do it alone, I swear"
You said, "It's all yours
It's all yours when you smile"

It's only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream it from the roof
I'm trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it ('bout it)

You said, "Oh, whoa"
I won't lose you, no, whoa

It's only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream it from the roof
I'm trying to keep it cool
But I can't keep cool about it ('bout it)
