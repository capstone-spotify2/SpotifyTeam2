Ain't it funny how, one minute, your whole life's looking fine
And a short few words later it all just comes untied?
You can't believe you're looking what was always someone else
Now it's staring right there at you, yesterday you couldn't tell
So shocked and disillusioned, helpless and confused
Not knowing how and what to say, not accepting that it's true.
You can't help but see the worst to come a thousand different ways
The same time trying to hold a strong and optimistic gaze.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the anger starts to surface, looking up, asking why
And you realize He probably wants the best, as same as I
Days just go by quickly, nights just never end
As time gets so more precious, every sunrise, an old friend
Trying to be a post, to lean on, a part you learn that's hard to play
Asking God to let you take her place or just take it all away.
Hope you'll wake up in the morning, was all just been a dream
You never take for granted every second that you breathe.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the seconds turn to minutes
And minutes wouldn't last
And the hours, days and weeks and months
Seem endless and too fast
And the blessings poured from Heaven
Like the rain on that first spring
Since that moment I first thought you
You might not always be with me.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

Ain't it funny how, one minute, your whole life's looking fine
And a short few words later it all just comes untied?
