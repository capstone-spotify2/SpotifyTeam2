I look sickening so give me all your money
I work so hard I deserve this honey
I've been working this ass from LA to Alabama
Turning it out
From the steam works to the slammer
Sparkle your eyes like a kaleidoscope
And when I don't know the words I'm like
Watermelon cantaloupe
My body came from Brooklyn
My hair came from China
So keep on lucky looking
Tryna find a boogina

Ganja, I got you paying a bitch to get smoke
I tricked and treated to this and get broke
I'm the wildest thing, word to Tone Loc
Off my words you're gonna choke
If you're paying call my hotline
$100 a minute
We ain't got no limits
Except an hour minimum time
Alaska, last time time you took my hot phrase
Went and made it into a hot flick
I could care less a bitch got paid
Cha ching (yes GAWD)
If the register ring
Estranja gon' sing
A blank checks what you need
If you want a fling
Either that or I need them karrots to bling
I'm a clipper
I need that crisper Rupaul money
I make you holla holla
Till you falla falla
Or platinum card honey
One more thing (Come on platinum card)
You should know about this chick
Pink money is the label
And they say you better pay a bitch quick
