Lord Salisbury said to me
"Though we spend our lives in isolation
Girdled 'round by the Emerald Sea
No fear shall we know".
Look away, look away, look away
To the lamp-lit square
At the ebb of May
Look away, look away, look away
For our survival

Lord Salisbury takes his time
The government sits in contemplation
All is ordered and in its prime
No fear shall we know
Look away, look away, look away
To the fog-bound ship in the icy bay
Look away, look away, look away
For our survival

On th mantelpiece is a silver clock
And it counts the hours and they won't turn back
The evening set and the room forgets
The day that went before
And through my window
Iron wheels on a cobbled mews
You will know changes soon

Lord Salisbury reads the news
And puts the paper on the table
Many paths will be ours to choose
No fear shall we know
Look away, look away, look away
To the fleets of steel and the waves of grey
Look away, look away, look away
For our survival

The Queen is old but she lingers still
Like the fading ring of a distant bell
And Oscar Wilde in his prison cell
Laments a brighter day
And in some window a red flag flies
In a meeting room
You will know changes soon

Lord Salisbury said to me
"Though we spend our lives in isolation
Girdled 'round by the Emerald Sea
No fear shall we know".
Look away, look away, look away
To the lonesome cry of the modern day
Look away, look away, look away
For our survival
