Indeed I have sucked it up to heights
unknown to those outside
my body has contained and suppressed
and swallowed and abetted
Oh I am a stranger to myself
beneath altruism dwells
a force uncontended
a voice that is tempered
to boiled and unhindered

Who am I kidding?
I am not some Mother Theresa
If I don't say something soon
I will break from the weight of the high road I take
No

Indeed I need my chance to fail
some room to unravel
I need a chance to blame for two minutes
unbridled, unbrazened
so I need imaginings of maiming
fantasies of outright screaming
I need a chance to thrash for minutes
uncontained, unforgiving

Who am I kidding?
I am not some Mother Theresa
If I don't do something soon
I will die from restraint
As a sick subjugate
No

I will move beyond, I'm certain of that
the sooner I go the quicker I'll be back
I would not threaten or cause you any harm
Have to get this out or my light will go out

Who am I kidding?
I am not some Mother Theresa
If I don't do something soon
I will die from restraint
As a sick subjugate
No
