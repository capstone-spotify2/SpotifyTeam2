You learn to sing
You learn to play
Why don't the businessmen
Ever learn to pay

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You play in halls
Play in bars
You're climbin' walls
Chasin' stars

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You pay the man
You pay your dues
When it's all gone, ooh
You sing the blues

Show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You wanna roll
You wanna rock
You find it hard
If your guitar's in hock

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You're smoking butts
They smoke cigars
You're drown in debt
They drown in bars

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You pull a chick
Take her home
No use, man
You're worn out to the bone

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

That's show business, show business
That's show business, show business, show business
That's the way it goes
Know what I mean
