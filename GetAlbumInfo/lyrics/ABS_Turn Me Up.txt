Well I know you heard about girl how I like to
When I do my thing when I'm in the mood
And if you want girl we can freak, on that dirty week
Girl I think I'm falling for you

Yeh, you're giving me those feelings
You're making me go crazy
I'm talking to you laydee
Make me be, make me be...

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
Your fooling around and around
You turn me inside out

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
I'm turning around and around
Without my feet on the ground

Ba da da da da
Yeh C'mon
Let me do it again

Always get myself caught up in situations (situation)
I'm always feeling on the side of desire (desire)
But the only thing I've found
It ain't cool when you're around (you're around)
Cause I'm burning girl
You set me on fire

Yeh, you're giving me those feelings
You're making me go crazy
I'm talking to you laydee (layyydddeee)
Make me be, make me be...

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
Your fooling around and around
You turn me inside out

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
I'm turning around and around
Without my feet on the ground

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
Your fooling around and around
You turn me inside out

Your turning me up
Your turning me down
I'm turning around and around
Without my feet on the ground, Yeh
