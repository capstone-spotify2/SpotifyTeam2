I went to the doctor to open up my heart 
Got my symptoms all mixed up 
He didn't know where to start 
Ain't no doctor in this world 
That can keep a broken heart from falling apart 

'Cause they don't know 
Oh, they don't know 

I went to my mother to show me how to cry 
She said "Baby let me shed your tears, I'll make the sacrifice" 
But ain't no crying in this world's gonna take the place of mine 

'Cause they don't know 
They don't know 

Some questions have answers 
And others just lead you on 
Some answers don't answer enough 
But I know 
The answer is love 

But they don't know 
Oh, they don't know 

I went to my brother to help me understand 
Asked him why they're walking by 
Don't seem to give a damn 
Don't they see the love they pair's walking by empty-handed 

'Cause they don't know 
They don't know 

I went to my father to get some prayer for me 
He said I hold my head up high 'cause there's something there for me 
Crying but I'm smiling through 
'cause suddenly I see 

What they don't know 
They don't know that 

Sometimes, 

Some questions have answers 
And others just lead you on 
Some answers don't answer enough 
But I know 
The answer is love 

But they don't know 
Oh, they don't know...
