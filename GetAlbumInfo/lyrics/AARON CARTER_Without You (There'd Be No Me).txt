I've been around on this journey
And I'm learning
As the world keeps turning
You got a face to fight
Just to live the dream
Who could've believe
That one of achieved
Who would have ever guessed
It would be like that
(Come on)

But through it all
Who's been there for me
To care for me
Even shed a tear for me
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)

Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)

No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)

It's a dream that
I've come so far
The ups and downs were there
But I've worked so hard
Many people don't know the life I live
Always on the road, always planning the show
Getting down to business in the studio
I can face the day cause the love you give
Through it all when the day is done
The nights begun
You're still my No. 1
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)

Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)

No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)

One shout to my family
Cause when things get hard you understand me
Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there you know you're not alone
Three shouts to my label
Cause with them I would not be able to make the fourth
Shout out the ones I think about
Masterpiece to the masterplan
That's you the fans

Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)

No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)

Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)

No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me)
