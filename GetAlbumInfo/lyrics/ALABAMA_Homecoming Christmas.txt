A glowin' fire and fallin' snow,
They spark a memory
Stockings hangin', mistletoe,
Presents beneath a tree.
A happy boy wakin' up to toys,
And lookin' so surprised.
And wondering how Santa knew
Just when I closed my eyes.

It's a Homecoming Christmas,
Goin' back where it all began
Homecoming Christmas,
I wanna be there once again.
Memories so sweet and strong
And I've been gone too long
It's Christmas time and I'm goin' home.

I can see the Christmas tree
And feel the warm fireplace
Handmade decorations,
Homemade pies and cakes
Family together now
With so much love to share
A special time and I can't wait,
Can't wait to be back there.

It's a Homecoming Christmas,
Goin' back to where it all began
Homecoming Christmas,
I wanna be there once again
Memories so sweet and strong
And I've been gone too long
It's Christmas time and I'm goin' home.

It's a Homecoming Christmas,
Goin' back to where it all began
Homecoming Christmas,
I wanna be there once again
Memories so sweet and strong
And I've been gone too long
It's Christmas time and I'm goin' home.

It's Christmas time and I'm goin' home.

Going Home... Going Home...
