I say come on
Can you stand the heat
You feel the flames
Burning in the streets

Get it on - get it on

The stars of heaven
Will fall today
You'll know the devil you know
Had his day

Hell what a night - get ready
Hell what a night - hey
Take your pick - get the kick
It's gonna be hell tonight

Alright

A lightning blitz
Comes raging down
You go running
For higher ground

Get it on - get it on

Hear me tonight
Your blood runs cold
A killer guitar
Screams in your soul

Hell what a night - get ready
Hell what a night - hey
Take your pick - get the kick
It's gonna be hell tonight - yeah

Get it on - get it on
Get it on - get it on
It's coming on

Hell what a night - get ready
Hell what a night - hey
Take your pick - get the kick
It's gonna be hell tonight

Hell what a night - get ready
Hell what a night - hey
Take your pick - get the kick
It's gonna be hell tonight
It's gonna be hell tonight
