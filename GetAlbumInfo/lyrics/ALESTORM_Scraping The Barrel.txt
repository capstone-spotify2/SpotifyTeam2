For many a-year we have travelled the seas,
Singing songs about pirates and all their misdeeds!
Stories of treasure and great undead foes,
Just a day in the life of a man that I know.

Your legendary prowess in drinking much beer
Recorded in song for all people to hear.
But many have asked where we're next gonna sail
The answer lies deep in a barrel of ale!

<i>[Chorus 2x:]</i>
There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!

You may think you've heard all this music before,
That Running Wild did it back in '84
But times are a-changing and we don't give a damn!
So if you don't like it, go start your own band!

Many have told us that we can't go on!
That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs!
But when the time comes to write album four,
We'll scrape at the barrel once more!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus 3x:]</i>
There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!
