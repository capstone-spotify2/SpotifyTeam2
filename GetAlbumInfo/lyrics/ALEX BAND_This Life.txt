(Living this life for)

I believe in the common man
Working hard with the dirt on his hands
He knows that we can't understand it all

And I believe in our darkest hour
You will find that there is a power
I believe in the faith that makes us one

But some days, I can't find my own way
Not sure where to go, now I just need to know

Tell me what we're living this life for
We can't go on not knowing anymore
Just standing here in front of this open door
So tell me what we're living this life for

What we're living this life for
What we're living this life for

I believe in eternity
Long after we live and breathe
I believe that the best is yet to come

And I know in our darkest hour
We will find that there is a power
I believe in a faith that makes us one

But some days, we just go our own ways
All under the gun, what have we become

Tell me what we're living this life for
We can't go on not knowing anymore
Just standing here in front of this open door
So tell me what we're living this life for

What are we living this life for
Don't you think that it's time we know?
What are we living this life for

When I sleep, I can feel the heart beat
Of each and every one, staring at the sun
Even though that some days, I can't find my own way
Just to come and then, I'll never understand

Tell me what we're living this life for
We can't go on not knowing anymore
Just standing here in front of this open door
So tell me what we're living this life for

What are we living this life for
Don't you think that it's time we know?
What are we living this life for

Don't you think that it's time we know?
(Don't you think that it's time we know?)
