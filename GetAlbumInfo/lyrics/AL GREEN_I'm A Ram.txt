Drive on
Until I get there
I got to drive on
Until I get there

I'm a ram, yes I am
I know just what to do
I keep on pushin', baby
Until I get next to you

I'm a ram
Bet your life, I am
I'm a ram
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I got to drive on
Until I get there

I'm a ram, yes I am
And you are what I lack
I keep on pushin' you, baby
You keep on pushin' me back

I'm a ram
Bet your life I am
I'm a ram
I wanna get close to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I got to drive on
Until I get there

The ram caught in a bush
Needs to be free
Well somebody, I said
Come on, it's about me

I'm a ram
Bet your life, I am
I'm a ram
I wanna get next to you

Oh, you know I got to get next to you
