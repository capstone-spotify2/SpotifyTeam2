Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Darling kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for evermore
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you

<i>[Instrumental]</i>
In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you
