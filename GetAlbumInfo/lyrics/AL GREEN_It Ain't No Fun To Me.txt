Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain
Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain

October sun is shining
These tears they cause me pain
Oh, it simply make up
Only just to break up, oh baby

And that ain't no fun to me
I said it ain't no fun to me
Leaving you, it sure ain't no fun to me, babe
I said leaving, sure ain't no fun to me, baby

I believe in you
And I would like what you to do me
Baby, oh you make me feel like a brand new man
Oh, baby, another thing I'd like to say

I'll take the love and affection
Wherever I can, baby
Now that's no fun to me, let me see it
That's no fun to me, baby

You got me standing here waiting
You got me standing here waiting
I really, really, I don't mind waiting
If I told you it ain't no fun to me
I want you to know, it ain't no fun to me, baby

'Cause sometimes I have to sit down
I think about it
Just sit down, think about it
It ain't no fun to me, baby

Sometimes I feel like leaving you, baby
I don't mind leaving you, baby
But it ain't no fun to me, no, no, no
But it ain't no fun to me
