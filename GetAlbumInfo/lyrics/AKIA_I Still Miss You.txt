I used to be in love with the finer things
It was all about the cars and the diamond rings
When I was with you
You never could afford those kinda things
Now I gotta man thatâs ballinâ N all I do 
Is think about how much I miss you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Coz even though he has a better car
And let me use a credit card
I wake up every morning with an attitude
Coz all I think about is you
And even though he buys me everything I need
That ainât everything I need
I miss the little things that we used to do
And all I think about is you

TV screen in the car, Cartier on my wrist now
V.I.P at the bar with my girlz sipping Crystal
Everything that I want why do I wanna switch now
I had it all but I threw it all away
Iâm sitting in a pink navigator now
I should be happy but I canât even fake a smile
Coz Iâm not with you
I went from trips to the beach now itâs overseas
Working 9 to 5 now Iâm spending Gâs
But money doesnât matter that much to me
Coz I still miss you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Coz even though he has a better car
And let me use a credit card
I wake up every morning with an attitude
Coz all I think about is you
And even though he buys me everything I need
That ainât everything I need
I miss the little things that we used to do
And all I think about is you

Now I feel alone
I was wrong 
I shoulda kept you home now that youâre gone
Made me realise that youâre mine
Need you by my side
True love canât die

Now I feel alone
I was wrong 
I shoulda kept you home now that youâre gone
Made me realise that youâre mine
Need you by my side
True love canât die

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Coz even though he has a better car
And let me use a credit card
I wake up every morning with an attitude
Coz all I think about is you
And even though he buys me everything I need
That ainât everything I need
I miss the little things that we used to do
And all I think about is you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Coz even though he has a better car
And let me use a credit card
I wake up every morning with an attitude
Coz all I think about is you
And even though he buys me everything I need
That ainât everything I need
I miss the little things that we used to do
And all I think about is you
