These hands do nothing, until You compel me
These feet go nowhere, until You propel me
My heart is barren, till Your Spirit, rushes through
This life is nothing, without You

I've reached the end, of what my sight can show me
I only wanna know, the One who knows me
My heat was searching, now I've finally found the Truth
This life is nothing, without You

Let Your hope, be my breath
Let Your love, be my song
Let Your peace, be my rest
I was made to belong; to You!
I belong to You!

You're my begining, and You're my forever
You are my victory, and surrender
Oh, Hallelujah, by Your mercy I am new
This life is nothing, without You; ohh...

Let Your hope, be my breath
Let Your love, be my song
Let Your peace, be my rest
I was made to belong; to You!
I belong to You!

Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again
Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again

Let Your hope, be my breath
Let Your love, be my song
And let Your peace, be my rest
I was made to belong

Let Your hope, be my breath
Let Your love, be my song
Let Your peace, be my rest
I was made to belong; to You!
I belong to You!

Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again
Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again

Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again
Take this flesh and bone; breathe Your life within
Take this heart of stone; make it beat again!...
