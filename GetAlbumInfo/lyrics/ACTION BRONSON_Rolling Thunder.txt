Aw man
Smoking in that rocking chair
Ah

My past life I was a Rabbi
Now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman in Venice inventive
She took a bump then started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I'm playing tennis
One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I'm protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus watching 'Se7en'
Land in Dublin
Pull me in the room and ask if it's resin
I said no they sent me on my way with blessings

I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
That's if your mouth running
You'll get your cow something
I'm rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don't spoil it
'Was is it baby?'
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I'm Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open up the comic book to figure who the villain be
It's me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I'm not around
She always hold it down pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep
Sleep, that's if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna
It's better than the piggys blissing on the corner
Come in the crib every night, and I kiss my daughter
Same lips spit on the lawyer
<i>[Spitting noise]</i>

We out
It's me
Always
Forever
