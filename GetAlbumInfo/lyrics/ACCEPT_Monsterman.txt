Screaming just for mercy
I am no monster man
Knowing makes you guilty
Not free of any faults

I see a hot, hot fighting
On controversial sides
They call me mercy killer
'cause I did it right

For love I gave your fading life
For love I had to give you up

I am no monster man - mercy or crime
Dead or alive, dead or alive
I am no monster man - mercy or crime

Facing all the trouble
I still remember our nights
And we're swearing both to free us
When life is only pain

For love I had to give you up

I am no monster man - mercy or crime
Dead or alive, dead or alive
I am no monster man - mercy or crime

Monster man

I am no monster man - mercy or crime
Dead or alive, dead or alive
I am no monster man - mercy or crime
Dead or alive, dead or alive

I am no monster man...
