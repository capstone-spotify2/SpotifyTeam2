So fake that you
You hate it
A city that seems so jaded
I can't
I can't end up like that
It's all about what you drive
Who you know
In a second it'll swallow you whole
And so fast
Just like that
You're way off track
To all you
Who want to
You want to it just ain't worth it
To all you
Who need to
You need to know

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me
I've finally had enough of what you say
Now you're talking tough cause you backstabbed me
You're my derailment

So sick and so shameless
I swore I'd never start by saying
Do you know
You know who I am
It's not about what you drive
Who you know
Cause when it's gone
You'll be standing alone
And so fast
Just like that
You can't go back
To all you
Who want to
You want to it just ain't worth it
To all you
Who need to
You need to know

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me
I've finally had enough of what you say
Now you're talking tough cause you backstabbed me
You're my derailment

It's funny how you lie and try to wreck me
It's funny how you're falling on your face
I'm never going to let you disrespect me
You're my derailment
The train is off the tracks
I'm not looking back

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me
I've finally had enough of what you say
Now you're talking tough cause you backstabbed me
You're my derailment

It's funny how you lie and try to wreck me
It's funny how you're falling on your face
I'm never going to let you disrespect me
You're my derailment
Where do we go from here
With everything so unclear
Turned out to be by far my longest year
It's too late to turn back time
I'll never make it out alive
End of the day I see through all your lies
