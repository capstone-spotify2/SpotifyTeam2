I thought it would rain forever
Caught in the flood
Reaching for some high ground
Just before I went down

It's hard for me to remember
Just how I got through
Now I'm lying on the cool sand
Happy here where I am

I look up
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night

The rolling of distant thunder
Trouble ahead
Now don't you be afraid now
We'll get through it somehow

Just look up
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night

Some like burning all night long
Some like howling at the moon
Some just like to sing along
Cause we get lonely, lonely, we get so lonely

The stars in the sky above me
Can make me forget everything but you babe, everything but you

I look up
See your shining smile
And I know it'll be all right
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night

Just look up,
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. let it rain

It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
