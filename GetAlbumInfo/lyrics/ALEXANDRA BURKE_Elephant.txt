You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it,
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it,
Ey, ey, ey
You wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it,
Wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it,
Ey, ey, ey

How you doing? How was your day?
Small talk, small talk, you wanna play?
You getting further, further away,
No kiss. No hug. Just blank.

And I just can't figure out,
How it all turned upside down
And when I look at you right now, it's strange 'cause.

I know something's going on
That's going on with you
I think you should tell me
You got nothing left to lose

Oh, there's an elephant, standing in the room.
Oh, though we're all alone,
It's not just me and you.

You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it (eh, eh, ey)
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
There's an elephant in the room.

Oh, you wanna, wanna explain.
Well your talk is cheap cheap just saying.
You say you're sorry, say you're to blame,
And you're promising, you swear you'll change

And I just can't figure out,
How it all turned upside down.
And when I look at you right now, it's strange 'cause.

I know something's going on
That's going on with you
I think you should tell me
You got nothing left to lose

Oh, there's an elephant standing in the room
Oh, though we're all alone,
It's not just me and you

You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it (eh, eh, eh)
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
There's an elephant in the room

And it's crushing me, there's no room to breathe
Got me backed against the wall, like that
And I just can't see, 'cause it's blinding me
Coming closer, I can't relax.

(Ohhhh, ahhhh)

You wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it (eh, eh, ey)
You wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, do you wanna talk about it (eh, eh, ey)
There's an elephant in the room.
