Years, it's been so many years, 
Resenting the years, 
And my heredity... 
Oh, I have hated and loved you... 
I have hidden behind you, 
But I finally see... 

You, I've mistaken for destiny, 
But the truth is my legacy
Is not up to my genes... 
True, though the imprint is
Deep in me, 
It will always be up to me... 
Up to me... 

Oh, free at last... 
Oh, I'm free at last.

(Free at last...)

(Find your way... 
Find your way...)
