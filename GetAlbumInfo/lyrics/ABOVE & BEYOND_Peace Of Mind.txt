I lost all my riches
The diamonds in the mind
It turns out that this was the best thing to ever happen to me
Errors and glitches
What a way to find
That such hurt could bring you greater peace of mind

Ooh, bring me peace of mind
Ooh, bring me peace of mind

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you
