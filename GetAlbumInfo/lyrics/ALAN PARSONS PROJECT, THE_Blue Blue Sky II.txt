I only know what I can see
So I imagine what could be
Where the horizon cuts the air
Look for me out there

Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky
Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky

If I could kiss the Earth goodbye
And cruse the never ending sky
Where the horizon cuts the air
Wait for me down there

Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky
Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky
