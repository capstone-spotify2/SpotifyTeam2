Photographs in a card board box
Remind me I can't turn back the clocks
So far now from the starting blocks
I still don't know what this key unlocks

I say who
Made you give it away
Say who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now

Spiraling down
Memory lane I went
Hitting it hard
To hammer out the dents
No more sitting on a broken fence
It's to rebuild my confidence

I say who
Made you give it away
I said who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say, heh

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now

We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all

Nice to see that you're doing well
You're happy now as far as I can tell
We soldier on with the hands we're dealt
We're strangers now to the way we felt

<i>[Chorus: (2x)]</i>
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now 

We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all
