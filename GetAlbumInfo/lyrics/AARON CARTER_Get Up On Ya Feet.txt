Say ya gotta believe, ya gotta put on the show
Everybody's on the floor sayin ???
Face to face now we're comin' back
Hear the noise and feel the heat
From block to block, and down every street

Don't have to run when ya get the call
Beat the buzz is through it all
Make some noise all you girls and boys

Fire it up, fire it up. Here we go

Yipe-yay-yipe-io
Get up on ya feet now

Pumped up, funked up, ready to ryhme
From state to state
Workin' over time
When that runaway trains rippin' down the track
Jump aboard and don't look back
Now ya got the flow
It's time to show
The whole world that you're no joke

Don't have to run when ya get the call
Beat the buzz is through it all
Make some noise all you girls and boys
Come on. We're all fired up and ready to roll
Fire it up, fire it up. Here we go

Get up on ya feet now
Gonna rock the place

Give it to me high, give it to me low
Give it to me - here we go
