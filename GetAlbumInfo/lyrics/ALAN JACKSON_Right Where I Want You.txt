I'm usually strong
Keep love all away
Wall around my heart
So it won't have to brave
But you take me some place that I've never been
Now I don't know if I'll find my way back again

<i>[chorus:]</i>
Cause you've got me right where I want you
And there's not a thing I can't do
Completely consume all about you*
You've got me right where I want you

I close my eyes you're looking at me
You wake me at night walking round in my dreams
Windows are smell of roses in blue
And all I can think of is last night's perfume

<i>[chorus]</i>

And I've never thought that I would get caught
But here I am wrapped up in you

<i>[chorus]</i>
You've got me right where,
You've got me right where,
You've got me right where I want you.
