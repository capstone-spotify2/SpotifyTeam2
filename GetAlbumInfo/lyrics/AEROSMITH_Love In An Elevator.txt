Workin' like a dog fo de boss man
Workin' for de company
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'
I'm gonna have a fantasy
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
to read between the lines

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Jacki's in the elevator
Lingerie second floor
She said 'can I see you later
And love you just a little more?'
I kinda hope we get stuck
nobody gets out alive
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mailroom honey 
and have you home by five

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

In the air, in the air, honey one more time not it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love in an
elevator
goin' down

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I hit the ground

Gonna be a penthouse pauper
Gonna be a millionaire
I'm gonna be a real fast talker
and have me a love affair
Gotta get my timin' right
It's a test that I gotta pass
I'll chase you all the way to teh stairway honey
Kiss your sassafras

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Do you care? Do you care?
Honey one more time now it ain't fair.
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
