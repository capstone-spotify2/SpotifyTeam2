Seems like yesterday my life had begun
As we went through life
Tryin' to make it so much fun
And I know that I'm still in love with you
Cause you're one bad habit that I can't refuse
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard

Life's been strange to me since you've been gone
And it's so hard tryin'; to say that I was wrong
Now I know that I'm still in love with you
Cause you're the one bad habit that I can't refuse
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard

You know and I know that you can't live on memories alone
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of
Just one habit that I can't shake off, it's you
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
And there's just one memory I'm thinking of
Just one habit that I can't shake off, it's you
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
