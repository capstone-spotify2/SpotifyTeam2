Eager and waiting for you, wonder if you're waiting too
All of my senses on fire, wonder if you feel desire
Anxious and praying for you, my love
For you, my love, when we're apart

Heart in my hands, I go on
You in my heart, I am strong
Anxiously waiting for you, my love
For you, my love, when do we start?

Across the midnight sky, eagerly I fly
All I feel is desire, desire for you
Open up your heart, make the magic start
Even while we're apart, I burn for you

Do you begin everyday thinking that while we're away
Misfortune might get in our way, my love?
Come stay, my love
Reach for the stars

Across the midnight sky, eagerly I fly
All I feel is desire, desire for you
Open up your heart, make the magic start
Even while we're apart, I burn for you

Can't you see that I'm anxiously waiting for you, my love
For you, my love?
When do we start?

Across the midnight sky, eagerly I fly
All I feel is desire, desire for you
We're racing with the moon, morning comes too soon
We can make it if you feel like I do
Al, la, la, la, la
