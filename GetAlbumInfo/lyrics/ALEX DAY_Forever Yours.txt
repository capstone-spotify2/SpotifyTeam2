We sing together out of key,
Although we try it seems we just can't find our harmony,
We just don't fit each others frequencies,
That makes you out of reach,
And I am finally accepting that,

About you and me, it's plain to see,
We only ever want to stay inside and watch tv,
Because that's just as good a memory,
You're just good company,
And I am finally accepting that,

Remember the time when we stole the whole day?
And nobody knows it, we took it away,
And it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours
Now we own the night, and it can't be undone,
We'll never forget how it feels to be young,
Cause it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours

Come on darlin' have some indecency,
You know there's nothing you could say that would embarrass me,
I heard a song tell me that talk is cheap,
But it's all you do with me,

And I am finally accepting that,
It's just our routine,
We try and dream,
And buy the things we said we'd buy when we got more money,
All in the name of making memories,
That's what you want with me,
And I am finally accepting that,

Remember the time when we stole the whole day?
And nobody knows it, we took it away,
And it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours
Now we own the night, and it can't be undone,
We'll never forget how it feels to be young,
Cause it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours

Remember the time when we stole the whole day?
And nobody knows it, we took it away,
And it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours
Now we own the night, and it can't be undone,

We'll never forget how it feels to be young,
Cause it will be forever mine,
And it will be forever yours

This
Will
Be
Forever mine

This will be forever yours

Now we own the night, and it can't be undone
