I've got a girl and Charlene is her name
Since she flipped her skirt at me I ain't never been the same
All of the boys in our trailer park
Would take a bath and go to school just to win her heart
Her name is Charlene Gene, she's every rednecks dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 

Just the other day we were riding in my car
We got to Charlene's trailer and I pulled up in the yard
On her front porch was her old boyfriend Chase
He blew a little kiss at her so I kicked him in the face
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 

Charlene's got a brother and his name is Jim
And she's got one other and his names the same as him
One of them is ugly and one of them is mean
But both of them together couldn't keep me from Charlene
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 

Charlene's mom and daddy bought a brand new double wide
And when she moved away from me I will admit I cried
But that Friday night at the local quickie mart
A pretty girl winked at me and nearly stole my heart
Bobby Joe Briscoe the queen of the rodeo
She may be sweet on me but she don't even know
It don't matter how she butters up my bread
I'll always love someone else instead 
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most

Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 
But most of most I love her lovely name
