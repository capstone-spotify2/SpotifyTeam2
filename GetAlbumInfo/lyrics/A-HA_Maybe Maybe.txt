Maybe you were joking 
When you said that you were 
walking out on me
Maybe, maybe

Maybe I was joking 
When I said that I was running out on you
Maybe, maybe

I could be wrong, so wrong
I could be wrong, so wrong
I could be wrong

I don't know, but it's been said
Decisions travel far from heart to head
Maybe, maybe

Maybe it was over 
When you chucked me out the 
Rover at full speed
Maybe, maybe oh baby

I could be wrong, so wrong
I could be wrong, so wrong
I could be wrong, so wrong
