<i>[Adore Delano:]</i>
Iâm walking in like Blondie
A human ball of laundry
No shower, just my perfume
My tights are grey, no costume
Donât need to brush my hair out
Birds need a nest to hang out
Heels are a step from breaking
Iâm so amazing
One leather glove, one satin
But Iâm still good at snatching
Thrifting I found my glory
Cause I like wearing stories
Had you from the beginning
Iâm playing dumb and winning
My nails are broken busted
But Iâm still fucking dusted

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Iâm polish remover
Iâm ratchet couture
Iâm a goddamn mermaid
I donât need to try
I donât even care who gives a shit
Cause I look fucking cool

Cause I look fucking cool

<i>[Alaska:]</i>
Iâm standing 7â 7â with my hair up to Heaven
Dirt poor but spirit wealthy
Dead battery from selfies
Skin on my knees is bleeding
Time for a psychic reading
Give Dionne Warwick a call cause pride comes before the fall
My hairâs never seen a brush
Smells like jungle juice and rush
We got your pussy popping
And thereâs no sign of stopping
Eat up these kibbles and bits
Take us to 10 billion hits
A natural disaster
Weâre Team Adore Delaska

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
All right, so Iâve never heard of a hair brush
So I'm like a coloring book, even a child could read me
Well, you know what, motherfucker?
I look fucking cool

I look fucking cool

<i>[Adore Delano:]</i>
Cause I look fucking cool <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Omg, Alaska, can you believe this shit?

<i>[Alaska - Spoken:]</i>
I know, right, Adore Delano?
Our song is so good
I love it

<i>[Adore and Alaska:]</i>
Cause we look fucking cool <i>[x7]</i>
