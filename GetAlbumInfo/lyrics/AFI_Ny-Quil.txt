Sleep. I want to stay in bed all throughout the day, no one bother me.
I don't wanna open my eyes.
I'll lie here in my room. I have no need to see.
No one wake me, I just want to stay right bed.
No one move me, I just want to lie right here, right in my warm bed,
because I don't want to see tomorrow.
Here I am so happy, so just leave me be.
I just want to stay.
I do not bother you, so don't you touch me.
Get the fuck away!
