Young man on the side of the road. Lost and beat up with nowhere to go.
Smells like a hangover from days ago, but he does what he can to survive.
Single mom with a dead end job. 90 hour week just to keep what sheâs got.
But the bills add up and now sheâs caught. She does what she can to survive.
Well, let me say that love wonât take away the pain.
But donât be afraid cause it will never walk away.

If your scared that you donât matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookinâ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.

Some turn to a bottle. Some turn to a drug.
Some turn to anotherâs arms, but it seems like itâs never enough.
Well, I wonât say that you will never fail again.
But, there is grace to wash away your every sin.

If your scared that you donât matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookinâ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.
All you gotta do is turn around.

Turn around.

You donât have to take the broken road.
You can turn around and come back home. 
You donât have to take the broken road.
You can turn around and come back home.

If your scared that you donât matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookinâ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.

No one listens to you anymore.
Any your heart has broken down.
You donât need to move.
Love has come to you.
All you gotta do is turn around.

All you gotta do is turn around.
