I can't stop
I just can't stop loving you
I can't stop my hands from holding you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
You and me, you and me

I can't stop
I just can't stop holding you
And I can't quit a love like this from consuming you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
Me loving you, you loving me
Your love is more than I deserve
Oh baby, you made me, you gave me your love...

I just can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you
You keep me hanging on
Whatever I do
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no
I just can't stop
