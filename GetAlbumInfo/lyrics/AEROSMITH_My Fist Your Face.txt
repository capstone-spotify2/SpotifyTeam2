Wake up baby, what you in for 
Start the day upon your knees 
What you pissin' in the wind for 
You musta snorted too much blees 
East house pinball wizard 
Full tilt bozo played 
Second floor trekkie 
Makin' warp speed out the door 
Julio Anpacolucci 
He the only one who stayed 
Countin' up the days 
Please no more 

My Fist Your Face 
That's for sure 

Hey Betty Boop you got me droolin' 
I'm buzzin' 'round your hive tonight 
You played the hooky 'stead of schoolin' 
Son of a bitch put out the light 
Thirteen year old hookers 
Drag yourself right through the thorns 
You wonder why the man's outside your door 
Junior achievers, got the old bull by the horns 
Back in the saddle get ya s'more (some more)

My Fist Your Face 
That's for sure
Yeah!
