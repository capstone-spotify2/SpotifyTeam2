If everybody had an ocean
Across the USA
Then everybody'd be surfin' like California
You'd see them wearin' their baggies
Huara-Chi sandals too
a bushy bushy blonde hair do
Surfin' USA
You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
Ventura county county line Santa Cruz and Tressels
Australia's Narabine
All over Manhattan
And down Doheny Way
Everydody's gone surfin'
Surfin' USA
We'll all be plannin' out a route
We're gonna take out real soon
We're waxin' down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' USA
At Haggarty's and Swami's
Pacific Palisades
San Onofre and Sunset Ronaldo Beach LA
All over La Jolla at Waiamea Bay
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' USA
