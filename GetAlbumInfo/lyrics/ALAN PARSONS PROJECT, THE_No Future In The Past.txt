Yesterdays come easy
They're looking back at you
The Sun will rise tomorrow
There's nothing you can do
It's the same old story
Coming round again
What is done is done now
You know you can't hold back the rain

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And there's no future in the past
So take it slow - you're getting nowhere fast
You could be saving the situation now
You'd better run like the devil if you still know how

You know the tide is turning
It's got you on the run
Your last bridge is burning
No time for having fun
Time will wait for no one
To get their day's work done
We're in this boat together
You know one and one and one ain't one

<i>[Chorus]</i>

We've come a long long way
Maybe one day you'll see the light
But don't let it die
Don't let it fade away into the night

Yesterdays come easy
They're looking back at you
The Sun will rise tomorrow
There's nothing you can do
It's the same old story
Coming round again
What is done is done now
You know you can't hold back the rain

<i>[Chorus]</i>
