A shadow in an empty doorway... Call your name but no reply
I still see your face... but there's no trace
Photographs... no good bye
Seems like I must dreaming... but it's all here in black and white

A hollow, lost and empty feeling
They say all wounds are healed in time
But I feel worn... and somehow unborn
Every day's an uphill climb
Hanging on just for tomorrow... but I find it hard to see the light
I'm just looking for something... to kill the pain tonight

<i>[Solo]</i>

Yeah we're all looking for something... to kill the pain tonight
C'mon, we're all looking for something... to kill the pain tonight
