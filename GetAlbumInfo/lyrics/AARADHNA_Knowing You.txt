<i>[VERSE 1:]</i>
In this world of sorrow,
And broken dreams,
I found a place
Here I can hide.
In the depth of your charms,
Is all I need to know
'coz if I could spend my life with you

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Knowing you so long
I can neva let you go
Things that we have done
I will always love you so yeah
All I need is you in my life,
To make everything come true
Hold me closer forever,
I love you.

<i>[VERSE 2:]</i>
If I could spend my life forever in your arms, would yah let me baby.
Lead me into your arms, and I'll be happy to hold you once again
Again

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Knowing you so long
I can neva let you go
Things that we have done
I will always love you so yeah
All I need is you in my life,
To make everything come true
Hold me closer forever,
I love you

Baby neva let me go
And I, will always love you so
Baby neva let me go
Hold me in your arms.
Hold me in your arms

<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>
