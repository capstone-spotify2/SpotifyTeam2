Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing
Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing

Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a Virgin's womb

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to dwell
Jesus our Emmanuel
(Angels singing, tidings bringing)

Hail the heaven born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings

Mild, He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing

Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing

Angels singing, good news bringing
Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing, good news bringing
Angels singing, tidings bringing

Angels singing, good news bringing
Angels singing, tidings bringing
Angels singing
