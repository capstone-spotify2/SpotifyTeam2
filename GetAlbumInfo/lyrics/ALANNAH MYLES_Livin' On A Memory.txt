The street light crawls into a bare bulb hotel
Where dead eyes shine there's a story to tell
It's a life of crime on a bed of stone
When the devil calls you're better off alone

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And now I'm hiding from the light, running from my destiny
Haunted by a flame, lying low, livin' on a memory

The bugs still bite and the breezes blow
Between your dreams right through your clothes
The days roll by like cars on a train
And the August sky still looks like rain

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Haunted by a dream, I can't escape this reverie
Trying to break away, lying low, livin' on a memory

I'll be walking behind you, I'm a face on the wind
I'll be watchin', still payin' for my sins

I'm drifting down the river so slow
As the lights of town are beginning to glow

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Haunted by a dream, I can't escape from this reverie
Trying to break away, lying low, livin' on a memory...
