I love myself I don't need no help
I can do this all on my own
Just give me time, cause I'm gon' shine
As soon as I'm in my zone

You thought I'd fail but I prevailed
I guess that I proved you wrong
So the next time I cross your mind, or when you hear my song
Put your hands up!

Watchin' MTV, dreaming about a cypher up on BET
Tell my mom that's me, sit in VIP
18 worldwide, 'till I D-I-E
Cause T-H-E-Y never believed in I
Trying to belittle my religion bring me down they tried
Always knew I'd rise, if I get stuck to my mind
They trying to see if I'm strong enough
Kept my weapons inside
Kept honesty on my tongue, kept that smoke in my lungs
They say it's 2008, my family lacking in funds
Trying to go out and get it, and put you back where it was
And I know I could do it <i>[?]</i>
Life tried to change erase me erase me from who I am
Always been a creator, if I make it this was the plan
Life fell apart so my future could fall together
Shout out to my broken heart, <i>[?]</i>

Swear I'm trying to get a grammy, dedicated to my granny
Just so this could make a little sense to my family
Explaining what my plan is they got trouble understanding
Explaining what I do got me explaining the internet
So you get this cypher free, son you should be catching checks
Ain't that simple this the world that digital, that flippable
<i>[?]</i> a fanbase behind you it could be pivotal
These days music has never been more competitive
Compare me to myself, cause <i>[?]</i>
You wanna be the next ..what?
Find that shit embarrassing, aim to be the best <i>[?]</i>
That's what all the legends did
Shout out to Dylan, John Lennon, Kurt, Big, Pac and Hendrix
Nas, Em, Ye, Jay, oh I didn't mention
There's a long road but I'm fighting for the top
Hope to one day be included in those names I dropped
