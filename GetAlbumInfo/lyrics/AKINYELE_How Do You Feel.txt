How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me
Was she as good goody goody good as can be
How do you feel knowing that I know
And how do you feel cause I'm out the door
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you to

<i>[Christine McLean]</i>
And did she get you open with a 69
Doggystyle that's from the back and from behind
Now did she do you well
Did she go down low
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow
See my guy he did me and he did me well
He kissed my lips
He touched my tits and then my panties fell
With some cherry jello and the cool whip cream
I feel man dick go up inside of me

Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed the chair or maybe on the ground
Was it as good as good as you though it'd be
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me
When my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached found 44
It took his time laid me down and we made love some more

Ha now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put this dick up in her mouth
Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
I was a little astonished from the way she ws sucking the dick
Do get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit
Then start ducking the chick
Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie she know I don't come speedy
Before she give me long head like Nephrotite
Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial
Or get caught up
When we cheating in the night cause we get hard up
Keep the guards up
When you creeping through
Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
And all the niggas that cheat this song's for you
And everybody that cheat's this song's for you
It goes

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word boo
Cause they might be cheating on you
