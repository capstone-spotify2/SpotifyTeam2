You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallinâ
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see 
You belong with me

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Weâre never ever ever)

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(getting back together)

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But, I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Never getting back together
You are the best thing thatâs ever been mine
