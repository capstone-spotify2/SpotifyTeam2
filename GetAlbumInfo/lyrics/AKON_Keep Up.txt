<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My niggas, I'm a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don't think you can keep up hey,
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up hey,
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up!

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Cause when I'm riding in your lane
Gimme prop simple and plain,
Konvict model, no pain no gain
Everybody blowing up like they done drank propane
I slide through the hood, the game unchanged
My niggas on the corner still selling cocaine
Now I ain't even tripping you should do the same thing
Til I got the opportunity to make some more change
I'm watching all these haters getting close to my fame
Only if they know what it takes to maintain
If you live by the bar then we raised it
I was built to do this thing daily

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My niggas, I'm a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don't think you can keep up hey
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up hey
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up!

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Used to hang out on the kerb
Now I'm living lavish in the 'burbs
Women used to never pay attention, wanna flirt
Now they see me out in public, steady ripping up my shirt
It's funny how the tables turn and out there
No longer sitting in the coupe handing out birds
Collecting all this money from different parts of the world
Flown up out of this loop, gotta see me first
Cause I sacrificed it all to be me
You ain't got enough what it takes to beat me
Conditioned by the slums and raised by the streets
I've killed for this life it takes another soldier

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My niggas, I'm a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don't think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up!

Because in my field, only the strong will survive, yeah
And if you're as hard as steel, then you and I will collide, yeah
We gon' rush at each other like two rams fighting in the grass land, yeah!
And I'm a be the last man standing!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My niggas, I'm a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don't think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don't think you can keep up!
