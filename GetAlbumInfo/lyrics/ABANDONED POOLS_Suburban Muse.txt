Blue sky us holding down
There's no why
Only the sound of happy TV land
Cue the canned applause

Sidewalk fall through the cracks to China
Never get back
I'm nothing in these blues and laceless Velcro shoes

There used to be a reason why
We wrote the words across the sky
You and I will never die without a fight
My suburban muse

Green grass towering high
This white house, in it we'll die
A thousand tiny lies take the place of you
I've seen it too
In all the things you do
It lives inside of you
A parasite or two

I'm the king of ordinary things
They're killing me from inside out
I'll give it away

Between the cars on dusty streets
The cul de sac is where we meet
I crunch the leaves beneath my feet and curse this town
My suburban muse
