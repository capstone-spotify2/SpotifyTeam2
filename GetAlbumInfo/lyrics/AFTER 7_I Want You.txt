Don't need no conversation
Won't waste my time explaining
You know just how I feel bout you
Don't you?
Don't need no conformation
You know what I've been thinking
I've always had a thing for you
Just for you, girl

Girl, I've seen beautiful
But not like yours before
Can't take this anymore
So, if this is the last thing that I do
I will be with you

'Cause I want you,
I want you, I want you
I want you, baby
I want you, girl
And all there is of you
Every part of
I want you
And I want you

Let there be no mistake in
I'm running out of patience
I'm done anticipating you
I want you, girl
Your heart, your mind, your soul
Your body under mine
At this point there is nothing I won't do
For you, baby

Girl, I've seen beautiful
But not like yours before
Can't take this anymore
So, if this is the last thing that I do
I will be with you

'Cause I want you,
I want you, I want you
I want you, baby
I want you, girl
And all there is of you
(All there is)
Every part of
I want you
And I want you
Every day
And I want you to want me, too
I want you, baby
