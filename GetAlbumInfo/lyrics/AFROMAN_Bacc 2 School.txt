Man, my daddy told me
Boy, when I was your age
I had to walk 13 miles to school
I said, "Oh, is that why you didn't graduate?"

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah

Mama
(Mama)
Go to the University of Smoking Marijuana
(What?)

All of my friends go to USC
So I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them
Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes
I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses

Spend a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Tryin' to impress these brand new hoes
Laugh every time I have sex with a chick
Baby, don't know, I'm an ex-convict

Walkin' round the campus with my 'fro and dick
Every twenty seconds, I'll be grabbin' my dick
Full of alcohol at the football games
Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rich James

My GPA's droppin' at a very fast rate
It would take a miracle for me to graduate
Maybe I won't, maybe I will
Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a noseful of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah

How do I party?
(Party)
And still pass
I hardly
(Hardly)
Ever go to class

Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
If you bought it from me, it's illegal
'Cause I'm Afroman, the educated crip
On a rock cocaine scholarship, cook that crack until it's done

I use that for my Negro college fund
Broke minorities, sellin' dope to those bitches in sororities
She's drinkin' one too many 40's
She took her clothes off, now we're havin' orgys

Baby, I don't mean to act rude
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
Colt 45 must have got you in the mood
To eat a fat dick like sum soul food

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a noseful of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah

Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? Hey, check this shit out right here
Hey homeboy, don't stress, I got the answers to the test
My college professer smokes a lot of grass
She's gonna make sure we pass

That's how you pass trigonometry
Sell dope to your teacher, use niggernometry
On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me
And when the police pushin', nobody's calm as me

Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up
Black people in college act stuck up
So self-conscious, and insecure
You wanna speak back, but you really ain't sure

Look at me, what do you see?
You see the OG, you ashamed to be
So fuck you, you pretty little rich fat boy
You can suck my dick just like that boy

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah

I said, "Honey
(Honey)
You got some sexy looks
You need money
(Money)
To buy your textbooks"

Get it wet, and I can get it hard
We can slide your vaginal credit card
Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl,
Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl?

Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl
Open up your legs, baby you're the girl
Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl
You was playin' with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded

Down your thoat, and fuckin' exploded
Tell your prejudice dad and mom
To email their comments to suck my dick.com
Afro's the bomb, blowin' up like Vietnam

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Then we go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know, I been act a fool, yeah
