Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane

Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Well is she in another mans arms

Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up

She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane

Oh why, she haven't got here yet
She's the meanest girl I've ever met
Could she still be at home
I think I'll try to call her on the phone

Her mother answered the phone
And said that she had already gone

I should let her go
But oh, I love her so

She thinks that I'm lame
But the way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane

Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Oh, is she in another mans arms

Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up

She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane

Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
