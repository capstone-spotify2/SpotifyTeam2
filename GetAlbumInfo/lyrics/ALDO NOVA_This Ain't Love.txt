Another Friday night on backseat hill
We're coming for you baby won't you say you will
Must be my birthday baby got my things in your kick
I better blow out the candles before it gets too late
Uh huh

And there ain't nothing dirty and no one safe
Just me and you and my whole world shakes
She said, I really don't do that
(Don't do that)
Baby don't do that
(Don't do that)
It's wrong, but it feels so good

Baby don't do that
(Don't do that)
I like it when you do that
(Don't do that)

It's wrong, but it feels so good
This ain't love
This ain't hate
and heaven don't come
for those who wait

(This ain't love)
This ain't bad
so knock on wood
this ain't love
but it feels so good, yeah

And when I have your sex baby, don't hold your love
I didn't come to dance and you can be sure
Stop the music, I got to move
Oh your the only thing that I want to do

Oh and she said
Baby don't do that
(Don't do that)
I love it when you do that
(Don't do that)
It's wrong, but it feels so good

This ain't love
This ain't hate
and heaven don't come
for those who wait

(This ain't love)
This ain't bad
so knock on wood
this ain't love
but it feels so good

Baby don't do that
(Don't do that)
I love it when you do that
(Don't do that)
It's wrong, but it feels so good

This ain't love
This ain't hate
and heaven don't come
for those who wait
(This ain't love)

This ain't bad
so knock on wood
this ain't love
cause it feels so good

This ain't love
So understand
Your much too hard,
to just hold hands

Lets go under cover
Like I know we could
This ain't love
but it feels so good

Let me hear you say
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, hey
(This ain't love)

Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, hey
(This ain't love)
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, nah
