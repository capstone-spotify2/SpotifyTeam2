She said live young and leave a wake of beauty.
That's all I ever could have asked,
Should have asked from you.
And I won't forget to write you,
When I get there soon.
'Cause you'll be lying dead
From stab wounds to the neck and chest again.

They found you covered up in blood,
Covered head to toe in blood.
Face first in a tale of awkward love.
They found you covered up in blood,
She's bleeding, she's bleeding.

Gone with the stitching in her heart.
Left out a silhouette that just won't
Heal and dying in your arms tonight.

In my dreams, we die. (Locked away)
With this blood and this knife.
In my dreams, we die. (Locked away)
With this blood and this knife, now.

I know it's all just a bad dream now.

So now midnight's here.
You're all alone.
They use this fear.
It's all just a bad dream.
And I can't seem to...
Wake up from this. 

Midnight's here.
You're all alone.
They use this fear.
It's all just a bad dream.
And I can't seem to...
Wake up from this. 

In my dreams, we die.
With this blood and this knife.
In my dreams, we die.
With this blood and this knife now.

I know it's all just a bad dream now.
(I know it's all just a bad dream now.)
It's all just a bad dream now.
(I know it's all just a bad dream now.)
It's all just a bad dream now.
(I know it's all just a bad dream now.)
I say...

This is the last time,
That I'll ever get to see your face alive.
They found you covered up in blood,
Covered head to toe in blood.
And I know that every day's a new day.
And my dreams will never die.
They found you covered up in blood,
Covered head to toe in blood.

She said live young and leave a wake of beauty.
That's all I ever could have asked,
Should have asked from you.
And I won't forget to write you,
When I get there soon.
'Cause you'll be lying dead from dreaming (nightmares).

So now midnight's here.
You're all alone.
They use this fear.
It's all just a bad dream.
And I can't seem to...
Wake up from this. 

Midnight's here.
You're all alone.
They use this fear.
It's all just a bad dream.
And I can't seem to...
Wake up from this. 

Midnight's here.
You're all alone.
They use this fear.
It's all just a bad dream.
And I can't seem to...
Wake up from this nightmare.
