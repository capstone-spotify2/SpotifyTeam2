To all those who have been took
They better take another look
Because they're never really what they seem
Swear never to betray the only honest man
Ever to set foot upon this promised land
Before you take them by

Love has faded
I thought I'd let you know
My true reaction
Cold and jaded
Don't you follow suit
Love has faded
Cold and jaded

You can not pretend
That there's nothing left to defend
How can you decide
Who goes and who stays
You talked me out my vibe
So much that I can't keep track
And you forgot about what they need
And then you plant another hate seed

Love has faded
I thought I'd let you know
My true reaction
Cold and jaded
Don't you follow suit
Love has faded
Cold and jaded

Soon as they come, they go even faster
Must be destined for a million disasters
There she goes
There she goes again

Love has faded
I thought I'd let you know
My true reaction
Cold and jaded
Don't you follow suit
Love has faded
I thought I'd let you know
My true reaction
Cold and jaded
Don't you follow suit
Love has faded
Cold and jaded

Cold and jaded
Cold and jaded
Love has faded
Cold and jaded
