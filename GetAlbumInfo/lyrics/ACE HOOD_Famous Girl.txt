<i>[Intro]</i>
She just wanna beâ¦
She just wannaâ¦
She just wanna beâ¦

<i>[Hook]</i>
She just wanna be famous, be famous
She fascinated by that life and the cars
And she just wanna be famous, be famous
On Instagram postin pictures like damn I gotta hit it
You take it, so contagious
And I can tell by the way that you are
That you just wanna beâ¦
That you just wanna beâ¦
That you just wanna be famous

<i>[Verse]</i>
Hello there darling, features are flawless
And deep astonished and pardon me if Iâm honest
But um your body tonic
God itâs so supersonic
For real, and the way you walk in them heels
No, you ainât move to this feel
Whatâs the deal? Got a job, where you work?
Louie purse on yo arm,
But still reside with yo moms
I beat the game on yo type
I noticed just what you like
Attention seeker, you steady tweettin them pics from behind
I see right through your disguise
Shorty youâre thirsty besides
I see the greed in yo eyes
When you see them ballers arrive
You watchin niggas pockets, say you model Iâm stopping
Having out with celebs, every week bottles poppin, I get it

<i>[Hook]</i>
She just wanna be famous, be famous
She fascinated by that life and the cars
And she just wanna be famous, be famous
On Instagram postin pictures like damn I gotta hit it
You take it, so contagious
And I can tell by the way that you are
That you just wanna beâ¦
That you just wanna beâ¦
That you just wanna be famous

<i>[Verse]</i>
I understand it, presence is so demandin
Louie, Gucci, Chanel and the Berkin bags hit the standers
Get it dirty Diana, royal this Instagramer
Picture perfect example how love is made to the camera
You model, oh I figure
Bookin it for remember
Laughin at yo agenda, her body bold as December
I get it, you corrupted
Surgery on yo stomach
Livin without a budget
Frontin like you be stuntin
For fame, for name
With the cars and the chains
That shit gold, itâs a shame
Do anything for the game
But fairly, apologetic of people shorty I get it
Truth is never accepted
Your motive is so detected

She just wanna be famous, be famous

And I can tell by the way that you are
That you just wanna beâ¦
That you just wanna beâ¦
