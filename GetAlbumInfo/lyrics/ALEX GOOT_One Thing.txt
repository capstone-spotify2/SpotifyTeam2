I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I canât ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

Somethingâs gotta give now
'Cause Iâm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

Somethingâs gotta give now
'Cause Iâm dying just to make you see
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

You've got that one thing
And you've got that one thing
