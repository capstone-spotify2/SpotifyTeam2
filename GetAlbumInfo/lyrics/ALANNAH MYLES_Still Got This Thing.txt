Why is it so hard to say what's on my mind
And why am I so proud
Still got this thing for you
Hm-m
I know you understand but you still need a sign
Real love should shout out loud
Still got this thing for you

Hey baby, can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untamed
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane
Still got this thing for you

When you walk that way I can feel the heat
Just below the surface
I'd do anything to you
Aha-yeah
When you're out alone I hear things from the street
I get kinda nervous
Still got this thing for you, oh-yeah

Hey baby, can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untamed
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane
Still got this thing for you

Let me see you smile, come on, look me in the eye
Too many times I let the chances go by
Pull down the shade, turn out the lights
Help me make up for all those nights tonight

Real love, prove it's true
Still got this thing for you
Real love, know it's true
Still got this thing for you

Hey baby, can I carry your flame
I wanna take you somewhere untamed
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane
We can't connect, oh that would be a shame
Well, hey baby, can I carry your flame
I wanna take you somewhere untamed
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane
Still got this thing for youâ¦
