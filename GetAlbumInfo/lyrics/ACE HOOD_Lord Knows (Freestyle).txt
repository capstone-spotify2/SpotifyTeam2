Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Muthafuck them other niggas be the state of mind
Got them haters on the job like itâs a 9 to 5
Getting money, mind ya business and stay out of mine
50 thousands for this rolly homie
I die tonight just bring my jewelry to the ceremony
Lord knows I be shittinâ on âem
Hottest nigga since that weather out in Arizona
Sleeping on me hope you choke and fall into a coma
Smell the frangrance know the money be the new aroma
Iâm just spazzing out, denims carry large amounts
Got them bitches throwinâ pussy what the asses out
True story, new glory
Money stacking taller than a two story
Real niggas countin money, never gets boring
Last year I made a million of the state touring
Fuck boys, know what you talking bout
I run my own team, aint no room for mascots
Look around, peep at the winners circle
We the niggas touching paper like a social worker
Plus them pistols keep them shells like a ninja turtle
Wear rubber, cus these Spanish bitches so fertile
Lord Knows I be going hard
RIP my nigga Daniel, remember that garage
Long nights, before that rap shit
I was thinking moving keys like a locksmith
No sir, the cops
Them crackers dirty, I just hope you keep ya name clear
Waiting for a nigga, trippinâ I just stand still
I aint trippinâ I just stand still
Lord knows that Iâm stressed out
Walking through these roadblocks with my chest out
Damn, 23 and made a million dollars
Fucking put a quarter million dollars round a collar
Couple more to cop a Phantom I aint talking opera
They sya my flow sick I should see a fucking doctor
Real niggas in ya presence
Chopper raise a nigga head like you present
Broward County I am that
Only nigga in my city riding Maybachâs
Motivation, motivation, my niggas fans are dead
They only location?
And thats word to my daughter
Iâm just tryna make it your headquarters
Word up
