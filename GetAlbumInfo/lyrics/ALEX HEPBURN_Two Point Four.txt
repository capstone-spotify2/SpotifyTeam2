Everyone wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Smoke a lucky seven chill take a pill
Make happiness a crime
And how many roads must I have to walk
Before I go oh man I'm lost
You get by but you wanna live beyond your means
Money in my pockets all I really need for another cheap romance

Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll fall if you lay down
Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll lose if you walk out
You get by but don't you wanna see the luxuries
You get by but don't you wanna love beyond your means
Cause two point four ain't enough for me

Don't take life seriously cause you won't get out alive
I do my best just to fail so bad
So my lessons never try
And hard work
Never killed no one but why should I take a chance
Money in my pockets all I really need for a cheap romance

Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll fall if you lay down
Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll lose if you walk out
You get by but don't you wanna see the luxuries
You get by but don't you wanna love beyond your means
Cause two point four ain't enough for me

Don't do a minute over
Unless overtime is paid
Cause the person that you're under screws you over everyday
By asking you to work
When you want it on a plate
You won't see the luxuries
If you are afraid

Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll fall if you lay down
Give it all give it all give it all you've got
Cause you'll lose if you walk out
You get by but don't you wanna see the luxuries
You get by but don't you wanna love beyond your means
Cause two point four ain't enough for me
