Don't know why
I'm surrounded every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life will end and it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears now are a waste of time
If I turn away am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I'll do
If I can't have you I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you oh
If I can't have you I don't want nobody baby
Can't let go
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily To you my love
To dreams that never will come true
My tears now are a waste of time
If I turn away am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I'll do
If I can't have you I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you oh
If I can't have you no oh yeaaah
If I can't have you I don't want nobody
If I can't have you oh
If I can't have you oh
Am I strong enough to see it through
If I can't have you
