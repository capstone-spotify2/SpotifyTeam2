God I love the sweet taste of India 
Lingers on the tip of my tongue 
Gotta love the sweet taste of India 
Blame it on the beat of the drum 

God I love the sweet taste of India 
Lingers on the tip of my tongue 
Gotta know that what's gotten into ya 
Any cat man do when it's done 

Oh yeah she's got that kind of love incense 
That lives in her back room 
And when it mixes with the funk my friend 
It turns into perfume 

When you are born you're afraid of the darkness 
And then you're afraid of the light 
But I'm not afraid when I dance with my shadow 

This time I'm gonna get it right 
To think of what I'll get tonight 
Just lookin' for a little taste, taste of India 
She'll steal the smile right off your face 

Her yin and yang 
Is just the thing 
She's unpredictable my friend 

God I love the sweet taste of India 
Lingers on the tip of my tongue 
Gotta know that what's gotten into ya 
Any cat man do when it's done 

It's like your first taste love of vindaloo 
That sets your heart on fire 
And if you let her stuff get into you 
It will be all that you desire 

When you make love to the sweet tantric priestess 
You drink in the bliss of delight 
But I'm not afraid when I dance with her shadow 

This time I'm gonna get it right 
She's gonna whet my appetite 
Just lookin' for a little taste, taste of India 
She'll steal the smile right off your face 

She a friend of mine 
She a concubine 
The sweetest wine 
I gotta make her mine 

God I love the sweet taste of India 
Lingers on the tip of my tongue 
Gotta love the sweet taste of India 
Blame it on the beat of the drum 

God I love the sweet taste of India 
Lingers on the tip of my tongue 
Gotta know that what's gotten into ya 
Any cat man do when it's done 

Just think of what I'll get tonight 
She's gonna whet my appetite 
Just lookin' for a little taste, taste of India 
She'll steal the smile right off your face
