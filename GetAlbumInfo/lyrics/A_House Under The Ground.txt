And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here

I find it funny, I laugh at people
And don't know why
I sometimes giggle, if there's an earthquake
Where good people die

And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here

I'll make the big man, I'll do what I can
I'll suffer for my sins
Speak with a deep voice, listen to metal
So that the good guys never win

And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here

Yeah you should see them all
When you sit in on Christmas day
But at six o' clock, on the sixth of June is OK
Got my life under the sun, pay for the things I've done
Pay for my mistakes

And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here

House under the ground
House under the ground
House under the ground

And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
