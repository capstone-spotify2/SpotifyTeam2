Pretty lady, whatâs your number?
Wonât you tell me where youâre going after this?
I see you struttinâ round in your short skirt
Bet youâre headed to the beach by the bayside
I just want you around me, I just want you around

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Are you a 6-1-7 or 5-0-8?
Got me ridin on IÂ­-95 straight to your place
It wonât be spoken about, itâs celebration
Baby what we smokin to now?
How bout that body, your out of town smile
Or the fact that I havenât gotten down in a while
Sall good though
Iâll get ya screamin in the front row
The correct information makes it all happen

And me in your bed could make us all happy
No downside canât ya see that now?
Yoga mat in your arms well I donât know how
I didnât notice that before, by the ocean every morning
Gettin to you know is on my list of importance
Gotta assist with the scoring
Got a mission before me
Just listen up to this recording

<i>[Hook - Dave:]</i>
I want somebody to need this body <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Youâll learn Iâm honest, I keep my promises
Make you love me not whatâs in my wallet
And Iâll show you the strongest
How the other side of the pond is
Donât know me, then you donât know modest
One quick pace and ya face got me brainwashed
Sun came out and the god damn rain stopped
10/10 you gotta aim up
Burnt brown hair and an Hermes tank top
What you wanna do? Ill give you one minute
Obvious attraction you and me itâs physics
Let me know if you wanna get in it
Itâs something new baby get widdit
