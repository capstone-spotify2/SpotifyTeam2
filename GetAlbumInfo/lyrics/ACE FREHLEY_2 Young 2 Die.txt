Walking urban streets and we got ourselves a gun
Not thinking about our lives and the shape, shape, shape
Shapes of things to come

Ducking down the alleyways of fear
A hungry cat calls and he know, know, knows
Knows the end is near

Now we can't take it no more
We'll smash down society's walls

Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
Too fast to live, we're too young to die

Listen little darlin' I said you'll never understand
Our times runnin' out, out, out, out
Out in this jungle land

Clock strikes twelve and the wind begins to moan
Shiver's down our spines and there's no, no, no
No returning home

Now we can't take it no more
We'll rip down society's walls

Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
Too fast to live, we're too young to die

We can't take it no, no, no, no more
We'll kick down the fuckin' walls

Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your sorry ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
Too fast to live, we're too young to die

Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin', it's to late to cry
Too fast to live...
