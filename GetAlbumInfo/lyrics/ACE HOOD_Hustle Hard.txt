<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'm a do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard
Big bank in my pocket
Double up with my profit
See this shit than I cop it
Gimme that there and than drop it
Homie, hold up with my mojo
Peep the whip and the logo
24's and they low pro
I bet she fucking, I know so
Nigga ain't no doubt about it
Riding round with that rocket
Load it up and I cock it
Send bout a couple off in your nog
And hear them 808's and they knocking
Whole club and they rocking
Rose in them buckets
All my homies up in here vibing
Nigga big shit in my household
Real niggas I die for
Creeping off in that Tahoe
All about de l'argent
Nigga don't stop the party
We be getting gnarley
Old kimosabe homie's chiefing cause I'm Marley
This is the same old shit

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i>
I think I'm from Kingston, Jamaica homes
Cause I got 10 jah and 10 om's
I don't leave the crib without my chrome
I keep blowing up, like my mobile phone
Them L red bottoms, I designed em homes
I spiked them whole damn shoe for you assholes
I used to stunt my black card for my new broads
Now I just whip the four-door, oh my gosh
The <i>[?]</i> Aston, I did that too
Wait til we come with Matt reds and Matt Blues
I'm an empire, you a little boy
Got a Lamborghini, that's my son's toy
Where the flip did I get that paper
Shades on I can't see you haters
Taking off when I see you later
I-I-I hustle paper

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
Okay now, all I know is hustle
Get it off the muscle
Block is my attire
Keep them sticks off in that cupboard nigga
I be going hard, bitch I'm going hard
I just hit the mall
You just swipe the card
I'm with a couple latin broads
I just do menage
Fuck you other guys
Pussy telling lies
Homie, free my nigga AG
Fuck you niggas pay me
Swagging in my saline
Two door coupe Mercedes
I am too much for you buster's
Bitches I don't trust em
Fuck em once, I fuck em
Lust em never love em
They won't play me for no sucker, play me for no paper
Make my bitches stomp her
Alpha zeta mega, better no-one really on it
Drive it, bet I own it
Money is involved, bet I know I'm on it
That's wording to my mother
Gotta get it one way or another
I put that on my brother
I'm out here on the come up

<i>[Chorus]</i>
