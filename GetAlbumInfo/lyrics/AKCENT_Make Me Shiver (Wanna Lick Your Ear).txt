Girl, you got me going out of control
Don't know what I'm doing
You make me flow
I can feel your heart from distance apart

Dance this sexy beat
So we'll have a start

Girl, you make me fever
When you move out there....
I'm staring at you
Make me shiver
Make me shiver
Take me over, yeah

So girl don't make me fever
Cause I'm burning... when moving around
Make me shiver
Make me shiver
Take me over, yeah

Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)

I can't stop what I'm doing
You make me freak out
I'm only dreaming of you
Let's get me stop

Wanna take your clothes of
It's better undressed

Don't stop moving around me
It's not a test
Oh God (oh God)

Girl, you make me fever
When you move out there....
I'm staring at you
Make me shiver
Make me shiver
Take me over, yeah

So girl don't make me fever
Cause I'm burning... when moving around
Make me shiver
Make me shiver
Take me Over, yeah

Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)
Wanna Lick your ear (ah ah ah ah)

Girl, you make me fever
When you move out there....
I'm staring at you
Make me shiver
Make me shiver
Take me Over, yeah
