My heat is broke and I'm so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah
The landlord's gone, and I'm done and out

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
Cold Gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together. oow

It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
Ha ha, the cheapest stuff is uh all I need
To get me back on my feet again
