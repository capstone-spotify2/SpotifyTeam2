When I was fifteen, in my parent's house
I met a good girl when school got out
And I was too scared to tell her how
I loved her still, I loved her still, I loved her still
Well we grew up and we both moved out
We went to, different schools in different towns
And is it, too late for me to tell you now
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer

Well I, think back every now and then
So I can sit back, and just pretend
That when you call me, I will tell you how I feel
And I never will, I never will, I love you still
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer

Every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of me
Every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of me

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
