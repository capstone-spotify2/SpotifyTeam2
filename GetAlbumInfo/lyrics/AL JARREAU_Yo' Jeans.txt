Football, baseball, Sunday afternoon t.v.
I know you no need to ask me where I'll be
But when you go out to play
I may have to slip away
I'm a 49er but nothin's finer than yo' jeans
Talkin' bout yo'
jeans, cha, cha, cha

Newport, Bridgeport, Cincinnati, Brooklyn,
Queens
Sweet mint julip afternoons in New Orleans
But when you do your sweet sashay
I'll be up and on my way
Fond of Carolina but nothins' finer than
Yo' jeans
