Flee today with me and we can hide
Until they want you
Where the strange creatures play
Mystic games of strength. Disassociate.
Seal my fate, seal my, seal your
Until they eat their own young

This is a lonely war tonight and I'm forsaken
Are you a lonely one, too? OH
This is a lonely war tonight, with soldiers breaking
They were the lonely once too.

Leave your stain and laugh. My wounds innate.
Leave like they all do.
We the strange creatures play
Endless games of hate, we the reprobate
Seal our fate, seal our, seal your
Till we eat our own young

This is a lonely war tonight and I'm forsaken
Are you a lonely one, too? OH
This is a lonely war tonight, with soldiers breaking
They were the lonely once, too

This is a lonely war tonight and I'm forsaken
Are you a lonely one, too? OH
This is a lonely war tonight, with soldiers breaking
They were the lonely ones, too

This is a lonely war tonight and I'm forsaken
Are you a lonely one, too?
Are you a lonely one, too? with soldiers breaking
Are you a lonely one, too?
