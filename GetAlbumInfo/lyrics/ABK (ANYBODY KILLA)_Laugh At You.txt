A mind is a terrible thing to waste 
High school reunion wouldn't show my face 
I was always looked at a little different 
And I got blamed for everything, 
even if I ain't do the shit 
It was hectic, a total fuckin' nightmare 
A room full of preps, and one thug with braided hair 
Runnin' through the halls screamin' "Fuck all ya'll!" 
Brass knuckle punch jackin' all jock's jaws 
Insane in the cranium, people always starin' 
Pointin' at me, laughin' close enough 
so I can hear 'em 
Until the day that I got my revenge 
When they found one student stabbed to death with a pen 
Whole school goin' through some emotional stress 
Gotta half day off cause of that bullshit 
Let me take another victim see if I can get a whole day 
Remember that bitch Lisa? 
They just found her in the hallway 
I ain't playin' no more, stop laughin' 
'Cause all that chit-chattin' as got this killa crackin' 
Teacher's pet, bullethole in ya chest 
Whole football team damn near layed to rest 
Half the students missin', and no one knows shit 
They haven't got a clue that it was all me, bitch 
Higher education learn a little something ya'self 
Who's next to be got, not too many left 
I'm so glad this year's almost over 
And maybe next year, before they laugh, 
they'll look over the shoulder 
New students comin' in, I'mma still be in the same grade 
Murder after murder all the way until I graduate 
Crazy killa, crazy killa's what they call me 
No evidence, but I'm still the number one suspect 
Never once was invited to a party 
And if I ever was, all I'd do is bring bloodshed 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
They don't like me 
They don't want me 
Ever since I got here 
They treated me strange 
They got me going crazy 
Ain't nobody feelin' my pain 

Shed no more tears 
So many years, my head's been clear 
But now I understand 
to make all those around fear 

<i>[Repeat 25x until end, through all the chaotic sounds]</i>
They're all gonna laugh at you!
