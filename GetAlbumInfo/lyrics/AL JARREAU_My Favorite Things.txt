Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with string
These are a few of my favorite things!

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and slay bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild gees that fly with the moon en their wings
These are a few of my favorite things!

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eye lashes
Silver white winters that melt into spring
These are a few of my favorite things!

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad, I simply remember
My favorite things!
And then I don't feel so bad!
