I see trouble coming man

Well I'm coming back to a fork
Sliding down a road
Gonna lick 'em on down
We're gonna run right out
I'm a fighting fool
And I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on a line
I'm protecting my life
Rock with me
Come on come on

You're only spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight

Make your heartbeat thump
Make your starter jump
You're running on time
Then you're fighting all night
With my rocking shoes
'Cuz I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line
All my life
Rock with me
Come on come on you want it

Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Tryin' to make it right
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Trying to make it right

You better stand your ground
And keep out of my town
To live another day

Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Trying to make it right
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
'Cuz I've gotta make it right
Fighting all night
'Cuz I'm spoilin' for a fight
