There were good times
I still remember when I made you smile,
When life was easy
We'd coexist in a comfortable style,
And there were feelings
I was inclined to believe they would never fade,
It's so funny
How things don't always work that way.

There was something in the air,
Maybe it was magic
And there was something in your voice,
When you used to call my name
And there are moments in my life,
That I can still remember
There are places in my heart,
That I cannot forget.

There was music
We danced in the sunlight and glittered like gold,
Life was free then
With time on our side we would never grow old,
And there were feelings
Burning with fire in the heat of a summer night,
And there were sweet dreams
When once upon a time was just right.

There was something in the air,
Maybe it was magic
And there was something in your voice,
When you used to call my name
And there are moments in my life,
That I can still remember
And there are places in my heart,
That I cannot forget.

There was something in the air,
Maybe it was magic
There was something in your voice,
When you used to call my name
There are moments in my life,
That I can still remember
There are places in my heart,
That I cannot forget....
