If I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
If I knew all the answers, to keep you coming back for more,
If I could paint a picture, and then cut off my own ear,
If I chose all the right colors, would this just disappear?

Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,

If I could write a poem, and find the perfect words,
And then put them all to music, just so my voice gets heard,

Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,

So if I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
And if I knew all the answers, I'd keep you coming back for more,

Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
And yet we still remain,

We run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,

Yet we still remain
