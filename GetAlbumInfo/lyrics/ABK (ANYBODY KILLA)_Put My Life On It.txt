I put my life on my music and everything around me 
Streets that I was raised on, livin' on so ruggedly 
So I decided way back in the day 
That I'm gonna try and take whateva comes my way 
You know, by workin' hard to get mine, payin' dues 
Tryna make it through, and outsmart some fools 
It's been a long time since I got to sit up straight 
So best believe I'mma snatchin' off plates 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee) 

I been in this game for so many years 
with no fears, cause my head is clear 
I can see you always tryna hate, on what I'm doin' 
but you will never stop, what I'm pursuin' 
Man, I got heart so fuck havin' enemies 
Take it to the stage, and I'll make you just a memory 
I put my life on every word that I say 
My guarantee is that I'm here to stay 
(So watch for me!) 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee) 

Mixed tapes, and bootlegs been through it all 
In for the long haul, follow me ya'll!! 
Put your hands up if you're down for the struggle 
Cause it's time to push through this rubble 
UH! 
I got one thing on my mind, willing to grind 
both feet on the ladder, and I'm ready to climb 
Too many mouths to feed, so you gots to believe 
that I put my whole life on what the fuck I achieve 
(and that's my life!) 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee)
