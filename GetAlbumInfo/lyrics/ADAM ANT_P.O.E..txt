Damn your eyes Mr. Khruschev
Don't go dropping bombs on here
'Cause if you start dropping bombs over here
We're gonna have to drop some bombs over there

Heard a lot of small talk
All about your doing
But we will be the last boys
Left standing in the ruins
Yes siree
Good-by-ee
To the twentieth century
Yipee-ya yipee-ya

Clamping on a Stetson
Activate the "go" code
Get me a citation
When I drop my little load
Yes siree
Good-by-ee
To the twentieth century
Yipee-ya yipee-ya

Pleasures of survival
Ain't so tough
Have a real good time in Vegas
With all that stuff
Yes siree
Good-by-ee
To the twentieth century
Yipee-ya yipee-ya
