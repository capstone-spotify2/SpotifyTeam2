At times I get too drunk to fuck, too high to deal with shit
I might just spend a hundred at the dealership
Even my haters gotta feel this shit
Enjoy the show, bitch you could suck my dick
You, you could suck my dick

As smoke lingers, the Earth spins like the ball on Earl "The Pearl" Monroe fingers
I've been a boat swinger, in my "Stone Cold" Steve Austin shirt with the clicker
You know we're still here, don't get mad at me
I've just been hooked on Grey's Anatomy
A good thing about that, is I could probably be a surgeon
'Cause I could cut flesh with no burden
Drop a tab of acid
Let's just be for certain
The reaper lurkin'
In 1997 dog, my beeper was chirpin'
The 850's started speaking German
To find the true meaning you must be determined
I just want to be on T.V. forever like Chris Berman
Have diamonds blind my eyes while my wrist turnin'
Have my lady suck my dick while the spliff burnin'
It's picture perfect, man

Feel me, right? I know you feel me, right?
I know you feel me right, uh

At times I get too drunk to fuck, too high to deal with shit
I might just spend a hundred at the dealership
Even my haters gotta feel this shit
Enjoy the show, bitch you could suck my dick
You and you, you could suck my dick
And you, uh
