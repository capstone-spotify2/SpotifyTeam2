Clap <i>[2x]</i>

Clap <i>[2x]</i> 

Clap <i>[3x]</i> 

Clap <i>[2x]</i> 

<i>[Verse 1]</i> 
I'm like a bird and I am so high 
In my lair looking at the blue sky 
Can't let another day pass by 
Without you knowing what I feel inside 
Cause it's embedded in my soul 
The day I stop will be the day I turn cold 
Let you know I'm breaking out of that hole 
And let go 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
So I can be free 
To do what means most to me 
And you can look back one day and know I shared with you my gift 
I hope you wouldn't think I just leave 
Pack up and roll up my sleeve 
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give 

That's why 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 

<i>[Verse 2]</i> 
So if your life is twisted and ain't going right 
Let's forget about it tonight 
I just want to make you happy baby 
Dancing and clapping (dancin' and clappin') 
Cause we plan to be here till the morning light 
Can you feel the change in your life 
And it feeling like magic baby 
I'm the one that make it happen baby 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
So you can be free 
To do what's what meant to be 
And you can look back one day and know I shared with you my gift 
I hope you wouldn't think I just leave 
Pack up and roll up my sleeve 
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give 

I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
Clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again 
I just want to make you clap again 
Just clap again
