Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

Ok, now who's that smellin' like some Indo
That pussy good, she can call me when her funds low
I make it pop one time like I'm Mentos
I still ride Forgiatos on the Benz doe
I say now come here girl cause you somthing I admire
Face like a model and a body like my life
You go girl, you go girl
You got a plenty Foreign ass, guess it's your world
I think the liquor kickin' in like it's Bruce Lee
They acting shallow cause I'm in this bitch too deep
I make it rain in the club, not a roof leak
I'm too connected in my city like I'm Wee-Fee
Sorry y'all I meant Wi-Fi, I bet the money make them bitches show their ta-tas
I treated a dig like a chopper hover rattata
I got your main lady sliding like the Cha Cha
Yeah, to the left, to the left
See Your man calling, but you heavy out of breath
Stormed out of the house, left your panties on the shelf
If he asks you any questions, on the real

Won't tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I'm from Chicago, I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out tho
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don't you worry bout it might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

Girl, he fufu with it
But you know I know what to do with it
I'll give you that, girl, I'm talking laps
As if you got a pool in it
And she say she ain't with your best friends
Then let me be your down man
You know you feeling how your boy press play
Just keep that ass rewindin'
Only with you got it feel like this
Ooh why, why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
