From the second I saw you
Wanted it all
Something I couldn't reach
I've just a hope
Always going for those crazy dreams
They're always tearing me apart 

Do I search for intrigue?
Something a little strange
If I had all the flavours
I know I'd start again
Do you see where we're coming from
Where I want to go
How much I think
How much I feel
Something you need to see in me
Do you know where tonight will go
If it could only go to where I dreamt
That night was slow
It's what you need to see in me
You know
I'm not your average kind of girl 

So if you keep me in your mind
That's all I ask
So I know I had an affect on you
I'm out of the blue
Unknown face to what you've seen before
But oh for sure I won't drift too far
Do I search for intrigue?
Something a little strange
If I had all the flavours
I know I'd start again
Do you see where we're coming from
Where I want to go
How much I think
How much I feel
Something you need to see in me
Do you know what tonight will bring
If we could only go to where I dreamt
That night was slow
Who knows what you see in me
You know
I'm not your average kind of girl
I'm not your average kind of girl
I'm not your average kind of girl
