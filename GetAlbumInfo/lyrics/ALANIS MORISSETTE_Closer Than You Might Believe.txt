Friday night's your poem
Saturday your wet dream
Sunday wakes you up slowly
To a face that you don't wanna see

I turned you on, but I left you hungry
And your heart didn't matter 'til the weekend is gone
Baby sure you're getting some
Really didn't matter if I can't

So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe

Should I take a number?
Should I wait for a day to arrive?
I still hear you cry on my shoulder when
Its not nice on what I gave you tonight
But I let you in

But you leave me standing
And you wonder why I can't relate anymore
Don't you ever think of what it comes down to
No one has to figure out the way that I do
And you know I do

So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe

Slow and easy
I'll tell you that's the way to go
It'll change the way you see me
And you'll will know it
And you will know

So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe

Just turn around and get it
