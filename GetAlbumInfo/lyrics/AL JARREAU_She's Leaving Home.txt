Wedn'sday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that
She hoped would say more
She goes down
The stairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.

She
(we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(sacrificed most of our lives)
Home
(we gave her ev'rything
Money could buy; bye bye)
Something inside that way always denied
For so many years
She's leaving home; bye bye.

Father snores as his wife
Gets info her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing
Alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"daddy, our baby is gone"
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How
Could she do this to me?.
She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
(never a thought of ourselves)
Home
(we struggled all our lives to get by; bye bye)
Something inside that was
Always denied for so many years
She's
Leaving home; bye, bye.

Friday morning at
Nine clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing
That money can't buy; bye bye)
Something inside that was always
Denied for so many years
She's leaving home; bye, bye
