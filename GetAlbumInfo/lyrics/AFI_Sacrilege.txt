I'm never gonna understand this.
I'm never gonna let it be. 
I just can't understand this aged plan. It's obsolete.

How could you recognize and cherish hysteric fairy tales.
They've come to life. Now sit by and listen...
the whole world wails. 

I feel as though I've been abducted,
or maybe I am just misplaced,
As I watch these rash hysterics lay to waste the human race.

Just ask them if the sky will open and save us from the truth.
They say that they'd leave today
just without, without you.

Is this one big joke?
I can only hope.
Say your prayers, they're the final punchline.

I don't see the love
below or above.
I see you're scared well
I feel fine.

Oh please believe I'm doing just fine.
For what's deceased I shall never grieve. 
Just let your faith die. 

I feel I have been abandoned.
I alone seem to see disgrace
as I watch these mad dogmatics govern our entire race.
Don't tell them you can walk on water or they may drink your blood.
Why live for pain, in the name
the name of, name of love?

I can only hope
this is in one big joke
with your prayers as the final punch line.

How is it divine
when it's flawed design? 
Fill the cracks with faith I can't find.

Screaming for pure love
you venerate
delusion based in hate

Bleeding from pure love
for this I pray:
We've got to shake the faith
