You ain't gotta say much
I can tell it on your face
See it in your eyes
What you used to have in your way
Girl, you got me fucked up
If you think I'm gonna fall
I ain't gonna trip
'Cause I done seem them all
So let me get this one thing clear
So you know just what you want
And you know that all you want is me
So baby let's just go from here
Gotta know if you're worth it
I wanna see you work it
To know that you deserve it

I hope you are
Because I do
Know what could happen with you and me
But I gotta know that you on it
Wanna see if you on it
'Cause girl, I want you all on it
Telling me that you want it
Girl, you better be on it

Saying ain't enough
Just tell me how you feel
Wanna see your watches, baby
Gotta see if you real
If it ain't too much, I wanna look inside your heart
See what's in your mind
Before we even start
I'm nothing like your friends
Gonna push your card down
You will never have to front with me
And I hope you pass this test
Gotta know if you're worth it
I gotta see you work it
To know that you deserve it

I hope you are
Because I do
Know what could happen with you and me
But I gotta know that you on it
Wanna see if you on it
'Cause girl, I want you all on it
Telling me that you want it
Girl, you better be on it

But I gotta know that you on it
Wanna see if you on it
'Cause girl, I want you all on it
Telling me that you want it
Girl, you better be on it

I hope you are
Because I do
Know what could happen with you and me
