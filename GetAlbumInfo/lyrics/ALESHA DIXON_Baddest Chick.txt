I'm gone so numb
Tryna to getcha some couldn't get a crumb
You know what I want even when you don't
I'm a give it to ya anywhere you want (want)
One look, don't stare
Give it to me now, yeah yeah yeah
You don't give a fuck, I don't really care
Put one in the air.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Spin my body round, like a merry go
Round and round and round
Just can't get enough
Get it get it up, turn my body on
You got what I want.
Got a problem
You're the antidote
Give it to me now "it's ok"
Get it get it up turn my body on
I got what you need.
You're looking at the baddest chick in the building
Don't show love and I don't catch feeling
Shine all day play all night
I can feel you got just what I feel like
That's what I feel like (feel like) <i>[x2]</i>
That's how I feel (feel like)
Just what I feel
Like the baddest chick in here's right here.
Come here boy crash into my bumper
What it do boy, move your body closer
Oh (oh oh) give me that (that that)
Till my knees get weak and your body drips sweat.
Yeah
Ain't play no games
Rip your whip boy go insane
Go go stupid, loco, whatever
You already know it's forever.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Baddest the sickest
No I was never the richest
But didn't I streaky the business
That you can call me the fittest
I'm turning dreams into winnings
So I'm determined to finish
You're looking at the baddest chick on the scene

<i>[Chorus]</i>
