I need some love, so give me some
You know I want some love, so turn me on
Sometimes I feel so low, sometimes I feel I'm on top, you know
Now girl I hate to start, 'cause then you gonna stop

I'm in need of love
I'm in need of love
I'm in need of love
And I'm hopin' you're in need of me

Now I want some love, so give me some 
You know I need some love, so turn me on
It's just that devil in me that keeps on comin' through all the time
When things start lookin' good, some things start lookin' blue

I'm in need of love
I'm in need of love
I'm in need of love
And I'm hopin' you're in need of me

Now I want some love, so give me some 
You know I need some love, so turn me on
Things keep on turning 'round when things should be sitting straight, now turn around 
G-G-Girl it's not my fault, I guess it's just my fate, you know me

'Cause all I want is love, so turn me on, you've got to
And all I need is love, so give me some, just a little
'Cause all I want is love, so turn me on, one more time
All I need is love, so give me some, ooh yeah do it like that

'Cause all I want is love, so turn me on and on and on
All I need is love, so give me some
