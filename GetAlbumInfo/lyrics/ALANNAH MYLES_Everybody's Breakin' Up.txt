It seems we're headed for a total breakdown
It keeps on getting harder to connect
If this is not a war between the sexes
Well then some kind of hex is in effect

The ones we used to call the happy couple
Have given up on romance altogether
How that perfect one could come undone
Looks like love's in for a run of nasty weather

Lines are down, streets are redded
Pipes cracked, apartments gutted
The tough are gettin' goin', 'cause the goin's gettin' tough
Everybody's breakin' up

It seems we've come upon some kind of impasse
An ending to this fractured fairy tale
What once upon a time were little home sweet homes
Are now just houses up for sale

Streets ahush, a grim reminder
No lovers laughter, no organ grinder
He's out of work, the monkey run off with the cup
Seems like everybody's breakin' up

Seven year itch, or mid-life crisis
We're comin' unhitched, goin' back to old vices

The tough are gettin' goin' cause the goin's gettin' tough
Everybody's breakin' up
