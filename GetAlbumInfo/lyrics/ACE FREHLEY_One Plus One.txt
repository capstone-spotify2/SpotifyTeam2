One plus one, is one
I know it's crazy but it's true
One plus one, is one
And that one is me and you!

It's mathematics
You know the score
When you talkin' about you and me
It all adds up to something more

No complications
No compromise
No need to stop and figure it out
When you're this united, you can't be divided!

One plus one, is one
I know it's crazy but it's true
One plus one, is one
And that one is me and you!

No calculations
No little lies
But we just count on the power of love
The joy just multiplies

This love is total
This love is right
I think we found the answer this time
There is no subtraction from a real attraction

Oh Yeah!
OW!
Oh, baby come on!
