Hold on to your love be strong when it gets rough
Hold on when it breaks cos everyone can make mistakes
There's always tomorrow when the light starts to fade
There's still your heart to follow
Though it may be torn and the edges are frayed

Don't wait for yesterday, it's gone so far away
Didn't know the words to say, I only know I want you now

Hold on if you can and don't try to understand
There will be another day when you'll see a different way
There's always tomorrow when the light starts to fade
There's still your heart to follow though it may be torn and the edges are frayed

Don't wait for yesterday it's gone so far away
I didn't know the words to say, I only know want you now
Don't long for yesterday that dream has flown away
If it's not too late to say I only know I need you now

Let the flame subside let the worlds collide
All that matters now is how you really feel, how you really feel
