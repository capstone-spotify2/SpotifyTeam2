Don't you know - doom over three
Beyond the hill of deadly soil
Ha, tell ya
Take care of you, beware of his magical plan
It hurts, bunrs your soul, breaks your mind
Never believe, never never
Believe the tales of mystical force

Please, save us
Bring us his trembling heart
Please, save us
Bring us his trembling heart

Black hill castle, (there in the dark)
Hear the thunder, watch the spark
Ha ha ha
Can't you see?
Weird lights - if they catch us we'll never be free

I saw his sinister face
Speaks your name, don't listen
Otherwise, your fate is sealed

Please - save us
Bring us his trembling heart
Please - save us

He tears you from the ground and takes you higher and higher
Feel his magic's all around - his eyes are burning like fire
<i>[Repeat]</i>

Don't you know - doom over three
Beyond the hill of deadly soil
Ha - tell ya - take care of you, 
Beware of his magical glance

It hurts - bunrs your soul
Breaks your mind
Never believe - never never
Believe the tales of mystical force

Please - save us
Bring us his trembling heart
Please - save us
He tears you from the ground and takes you higher and higher
Feel his magic's all around - his eyes are burning like fire
