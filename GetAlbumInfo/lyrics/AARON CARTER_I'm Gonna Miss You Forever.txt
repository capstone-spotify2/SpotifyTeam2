Hey Girl, I'm sad 
I heard that you were leaving 
You can't go, you're my best friend 
I'm sure gonna miss you 
I always think about you 
All the time you're on my mind 
We played together you and I 
I can't believe that its true 
Now I have to see you leave 
You're the only one for me 
My girlfriend, my best friend 
I don't wanna see you go 
I just wanna let you know that 
I have a crush on you 
I can't wait no longer girl 
To say what I feel 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl 
The first time that I saw you 
I knew it from the very start 
You had a place deep in my heart 
I can't believe that it's true 
Now it's time for you to leave 
And Baby I just can't believe 
My girlfriend, my best friend 
I don't wanna see you go 
I just wanna let you know that 
I have a crush on you 
I can't wait no longer girl 
To say what I feel 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl 
You and me together 
Girl, I'll wait forever 
It's only the matter of time 
'Coz I never wanna see you go 
I just wanna let you know 
That I can't wait no longer girl 
To say what I feel 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl 
I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you girl 
Gonna miss you girl
