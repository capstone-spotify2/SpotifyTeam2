A chilling silence. 
A world of violets. 
My breath materialized again. 
Immaculate. 
Inanimate. 
A comfort cutting time I see... a string of white lights. 
Forever walking through December. 
Forever longing for a sign of life, a bringer of light. 
Forever wandering together through a world of violets. 
Ice everlasting. 
A full moon casting a purple veil enshrouding all. 
I perambulate, somnambulant. 
A solace piercing time I see... a string of white lights. 
If only one for night, if only for one night, if only for one night remember. 
If only for one night, if only for one night, if only for one night together.
