Call me

What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other (yeah)
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work

Call me

Losing your love, acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you, it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real

Come to me
(Call me)
Come back home

The best thing I can do is give you your love
(give you your love)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong

Just call on me baby
Come back home
(Call me)

When you're worried
Things ain't going right
It's all in a day's work
Call me
When you're lonely
You can call me
When you're feeling sad
It's all in a day's work

Come back home
(Call me)
