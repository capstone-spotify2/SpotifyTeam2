<i>[Carter:]</i>
Swoop down get it in bounce, the townâs silence
A room the finest woman full of diamonds
I find this evening to be more than a rumination runnin back 
and forth through the doors of this colorful scene and I
She my queen and Iâm the king
Runnin things and I got my eyes on it, I want it
My dreamcatcher caught it
Sick of it Iâll rhyme illicitly on the front screen
While in touch with the aquamarine
Hot topic is what you canât normally see
Fires only burn when they room to breathe
