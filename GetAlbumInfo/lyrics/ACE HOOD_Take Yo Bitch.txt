A true playa for real
Man you heard about me
I done pop 2 molys
And Iâm going on 3
How Iâm out my mind
And this bitch so geekin
Tryina tell yall niggas
Donât let yo girl round me
Iâmma take yo girl
Iâmma fuck yo bitch
Iâmma take yo girl
I wanna fuck that bitch
Iâmma take yo girl
Iâmma fuck yo bitch
Iâmma beat that up
Give her all this big

<i>[Verse]</i>
Okay now bad lil bitch from the ATL
And she got an ass like Kay Michelle
Rule number one, no kiss n tell
Her head no joke like Dave Chapelle
I see I beat that pussy like a murder case
She gon catch this white like Colgate
Keep my hoes in line like Soul Train
Every day a nigga ball, no role gain
I say 20 bottles Iâm flexin
Diamonds and my Rolexâs
Where the bad bitches? Where the bad bitches?
Iâm just checkin
Man I pop the moly, Iâm sweatin
Back to bitch now we textin
Plenty more in my section
Iâm a young version Hugh Hefner
I canât even feel my face
I donât really need no more drink
All these hoes, they comin with me
All them niggas they canât believe
I say Iâm rollin, Iâm rollin
And this dope, Iâm smoking potent
I need you, you, you and her right there
Back to the crib so we all can share

Okay Iâm killin these hoes like Ted Bundy
Love a bad bitch, Iâm a head junkee
White tank top and some polo undees
Tryina serve a freak with this chocolate Sunday
Snatch your chick like a ally hoop
Shots that will rock, I donât do the goose
Put her in the coupe, I remove the roof
Then slam-dunk that pussy like Ron do
I say hold up doc I ainât feelin well
My Rolex sick and my pockets earlâd
Flowin off money, Iâm sick as hell
Bout 25k, thatâs life in jail
Now when the bad hoes there put them ass shots
Rep for a nigga, be the mascot
KOD, I brung major cash
And they waving at me like a can guy
Say turned up nigga donât turn down
Please donât bring your ho round, nah
I donât wanna know her name
Next thing you know we went 4 rounds
Iâm a wild young nigga, I admit that
Who? That bitch? Iâmma get that
Sheâs in love with my 6 pack
And I ainât talkin no beer fat nigga
