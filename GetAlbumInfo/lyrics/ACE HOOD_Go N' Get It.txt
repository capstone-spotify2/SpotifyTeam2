<i>[Intro:]</i>
(I do it)
Blood sweat tears
Ace Hood
(I do it)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty four I'm thinking money and the power
Bills due, money running low
Plus my cousin lost her mind and had an overdose
Way too many problems got me stressed out
What you do when you've got seven days to move out
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I'm out here chasing greens
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Uh
Money the root of evil guess I'm the devil then
Bag full of dead faces like Afghanistan
Hundred K or better, custom made barrettas
How about that paper cheddar
Hopping out that bemer leather
Tell em get a load of this bezel
Big face and the rocks all pebbles
Don't grind and a nigga don't shine fuck ya'll gotta get mine
Big dog, big money on mind
Running like to the sun up rise
Money it never sleeps got bags up under my eyes
Just know I gotta get it mama very sickly plus I'm expecting twins
That's just what heaven sent me
God fearing nigga this I who in the flesh
'Fore I let my people starve
God bless my soul to rest

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty four I'm thinking money and the power
Bills due, money running low,
Plus my cousin lost her mind and had an overdose
With so many problems got me stressed up
What you do when you've got seven days to move out
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I'm out here chasing greens
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
OK now riding around with that rocket
Niggas trying to steal my flow tho
Thank you for the promo
We the best still be that logo
OK back upon my dough shit
Sliding on in them two six
Lights due, car note, baby fees plus rent
Nigga just no doubt no I'm out here
Tote my.9 without fear
Most you niggas pussy, yeah I'm talking paps smear
Lord guide me as my day go, trying get my mom off pay roll
When I put her in that Benz-o,
Get kinda hard when them funds low
I'm sick and tired of her crying, tired of nickel and dimes
Look at her in her eyes but I know your son gonna rock
'Cause I'm a God fearing nigga 'cause I am in the flesh
Who won't let my family starve God bless my soul to rest

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty four I'm thinking money and the power
Bills due, money running low,
Plus my cousin lost her mind and had an overdose
Way to many problems got me stressed out
What you do when you've got seven days to move out
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I'm out here chasing greens
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean
