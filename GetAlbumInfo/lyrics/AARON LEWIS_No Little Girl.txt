Last night I saw her face
It made me lose my place, it did
It made me wonder
How did I fumble into space

Can't eat a thing at all
My appetite is way to small, it is
Except for big brown bags
I really love that alcohol

No little girl,
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah

No little girl,
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me yeah

No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight
Uh, break it down

The pain washes across me
The things that I thought we'd see, yeah
The pain washes across me
But now we're both strong and free, baby!

Last night we danced real close
That's when she feels the most, it is
Her pace is much to fast
How do I look inside my soul

No little girl
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah

No little girl
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me, yeah

No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight
