Sometimes when I look at you,
I wonder why you're here wth me
I'm not the perfect lover and
There 's other things I'd like to be

You never ask for my applause
I want you to know

I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours, truly yours

I'll never leave you all alone
Too far away to touc your skin
I don't know where the story goes
Or even if it did begin

I go to the ball
You sweep the floors in every way

I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours, truly yours

So sofyly you tell me
In words that will haunt me
As long as the light from the stars
Fills your eyes....oo..ooh....

You never ask for my applause
I want you to know

I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours
Because, because, because
I'm yours, truly yours, truly yours
