Lord I must be dreamin' 
What else could this be 
Everybody's screamin' 
Running' for the sea 

Holy lands are sinkin' 
Birds take to the sky 
The prophets are all stinking drunk 
I know the reason why 

Eyes are full of desire 
Mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire 
Shit piled up to the knees 
Out of rhyme or reason 
Everyone's to blame 
Children of the season 
Don't be lame 

Sorry, you're so sorry 
Don't be sorry 
Man has known 
And now he's blown it 
Upside down and hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job 
And now they say it's nobody's fault 

Old St. Andres 
Seven years ago 
Shove it up their richters 
Red lines stop and go 
Noblemen of courage 
Listen with their ears 
Spoke but how discouragin' 
When no one really hears 

One of these day's you'll be sorry 
Too many houses on the stilt 
Three million years or just a story 
Four on the floor up to the hilt 

Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known 
And now he's blown it 
Upside down and hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job 
And now we're just a little too late 

Eyes are full of desire 
Mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire 
Shit piled up in debris 

California showtime 
Five o'clock's the news 
Everybody's concubine 
Was prone to take a snooze 

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known
And now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound
We did an aweful job
And now we're just a little too late
