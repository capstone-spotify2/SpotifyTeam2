Running scared
Wonderin' what I'm doin' so far from home
Beginnin' not to care that I was so alone
Then my eyes met hers and without one word
I could tell what was gonna happen
I could feel it in my bones

By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
She took me to her room
Ah, ya know it felt so right
The heat's growin' higher
The flame of desire
By the dark of the moon
Ahh, there's a fire in the night

When she told me
She didn't often do this kind of thing
She said please hold me
Hold me tight so I don't have to think
Oh, her gentle touch
Really moved me so much
The flames of love swept over us
Like a burning light

By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
She took me to her room
Ah, ya know it felt so right, so right
The heat's growin' higher
The flame of desire
By the dark of the moon
Ummm, there's a fire in the night

Fire in the night

By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
She took me to her room
Oh, ya know it felt so right, oh yeah
The heat's growin' higher
The flame of desire
By the dark of the moon
Ohh, there's a fire in the night

There's a fire in the night baby
There's a fire in the night ohhh

Oh yeah, there's a fire in the night

Oh I'm on fire ohhh

By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
Oh yeah
