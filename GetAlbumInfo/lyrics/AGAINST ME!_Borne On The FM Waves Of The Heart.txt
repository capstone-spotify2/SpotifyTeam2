No, it's not what we meant to say.
We donât really love each other.
What happens when the summerâs over?
How long before distance becomes a chore?
I'm approaching with great, great trepidation.
I hope youâll understand.

Before you speak think about what you're trying to say.
Who else is there to blame for miscommunication?
You're getting caught up in the excitement.
You making promises you canât keep.
You need to leave all your options open.

Too much momentum.
This room feels like it's going to explode.
Too many angles. 
Too many factors to cover.
Waiting for signal.
You're searching for network.
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation.

Anxiety, Anxiety you give me no mercy.
Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep.
We took some pills to calm us down.
Then we needed help to come back up.
Just trying to stay in control of the situation.

Too much momentum.
This room feels like it's going to explode.
Too many angles.
Too many factors to cover.
Waiting for signal.
You're searching for network.
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation.
They fall apart so easily.

Too much momentum. 
This room feels like it's going to explode.
Too many angles. 
Too many factors to cover.
Waiting for signal.
You're searching for network.
You have to fight to stay in control. 
You have to fight to stay in control.
No, you donât have to fight to stay in control of the situation.
