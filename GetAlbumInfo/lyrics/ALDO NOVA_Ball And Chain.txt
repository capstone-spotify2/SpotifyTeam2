How many nights, how many days do I wait here for you
Have you long forgotten all the things wed said
And how many times must I let the phone ring, just to get you
Could it be that now this love has long gone dead

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
No oh No - Thought it hasn't been so long
No oh No - I'm sure you're feelins gone and then

Love, Love feels like a ball and chain
What a fool I've been to fall in love again
Love, Love when will it ever end
I don't think that I can ever love again

Well how many nights, have I stayed by the phone just to hear from you and
Could it be that I just wanna hear you say
That all of this time you'd been thinkin alone
Wonderin what to do
And that I love you is all you wanna say

<i>[Chorus]</i>
