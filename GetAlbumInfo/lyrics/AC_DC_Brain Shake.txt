Alright hold tight
I really wanna ball tonight
On a bender no space defender
A joy on the floor I'll get it tight
Toe to toe with a black widow
Fee fi fum smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rockin' suicide
My feet are jumpin' she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's a joy to ride on a rockin' suicide
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I can take
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

She's a mean lean rockin' machine
A hip huggin' blue jean dream
She's a woman worth givin'
A sweet sweet kissin'
Lips are runnin' round on me
Toe to toe with a black widow
Fee fi fum smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rockin' suicide
My feet are jumpin' she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's a joy to ride on a rockin' suicide
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Cause she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's an all out drive on a rockin' suicide
Brain shake

Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I could take
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
You can't fake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Well it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain
It's a brain
It's a brain
Shake
