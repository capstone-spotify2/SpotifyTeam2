I've been walking all my life
And I can't find my way to you
I've been praying to the lord I'm gon make it there someday, someday
Well if that don't come home you know I'll try
To make it on my own
I've been praying to the lord I will make it back someday

Cold world, killings, this crazy world that we live in
Got minors thugging and dealing life all good fuck authority feelings
Was raised up out of Broward, and my momma didn't raise no coward
Had a job and I worked them hours, my pride would not allow it
Young men holding all that power on dope like fiends with the powder
Came up now the niggas wanna doubt 'em
In the rows ain't talkin' flowers
Everybody wanna be so sour
You mad cause the shit ain't ours
Handouts only for them cowards
No college degree at Howard
I came up from the bottom
They so scared I'm getting hotter
We stacking them fuckin' dollars
Just pray for me, will you mama?
I done came a long way
Wanna know me? Just listen to what the song say

I've been walking all my life
And I can't find my way to you
I've been praying to the lord I'm a make it there someday, someday
Well if that don't come home you know I'll try
To make it on my own
I've been praying to the lord I'm a make it back someday

And I told my team that I got us
They were chasing a whole but the commas
Still ball like my nigga Udonis, I
Do me, never mind your comments
Go hard and give it no favors
Be around cause a nigga done made it
Where the fuck was you when I needed?
I'm sick and tired of your hatin'
I'm sittin' cool and I' patient
And my fans are steady waitin'
Why the fuck I haven't blew up?
Why the fuck I'm underrated?
I'm the realest thing going
And most of people know it
To my hood I am a God, an illustrated poet
I don't see no competition
Unless I'm in the mirror
I'm starving in this bitch and I just saved about a million
All my life I've been waiting for this moment
But still I'm screaming fuck 'em
You just show me my opponent, hold up

I've been walking all my life
And I can't find my way to you
I've been praying to the lord I'm a make it there someday, someday
Well if that don't come home you know I'll try
To make it on my own
I've been praying to the lord I'm a make it back someday

I've been walking all my life (my life my life...)
I've been walking all my life (my life my life...)
And I can't find my way to you
I've been praying to the lord I'm a make it there someday, someday (someday someday...)
