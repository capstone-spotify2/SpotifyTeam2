Sheâs staring me down with those electric eyes,
No matter how hard I try,
I canât escape that gaze tonight,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
Oh,

Iâm hypnotized by the way she moves,
Baby girl please help me soothe,
Imma take you to the sun and the moon,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
Oh,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
Yeah,

And Iâve been catching myself thinking of it,
It was three in the morning,
Every day I chase after her,
But I canât catch lightning,
Catching myself thinking of it,
It was three in the morning,
Every day I chase after her,
But I canât catch lightning,
No, I canât catch lightning,

Sheâll make you believe anything she wants,
Make you think that youâre the one,
She will keep you there,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
Sheâs way up in the atmosphere,

And I've been catching myself thinking of it,
It was three in the morning,
Every day I chase after her,
But I canât catch lightning,
Catching myself thinking of it,
It was three in the morning,
Every day I chase after her,
But I canât catch lightning,
No, I canât catch lightning
Oh I canât catch lightning,
Yeah,
I canât catch lightning,

Sheâs staring me down with those electric eyes,
No matter how hard I try,
I canât escape that gaze tonight,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
That girl's up in the atmosphere,
That girls up in the atmosphere,
Oh,
She's way up in the atmosphere,

And I've been waiting, waiting, waiting for you,
Anticipating,
Chasing after things that you do,
But I can't catch lightning,
Waiting, waiting, waiting for you
Anticipating,
Chasing after things that you do,
But I can't catch lightning,
No, I canât catch lightning,
Oh yeah,
No I can't catch lightning,
Oh I can't catch lightning,
Oh no,
I can't catch lightning
