We are haunted
I seem to have forgotten
Clear and conscious
I seem to have forgotten
Yeah, you know, it's more or less the same
But I'll take the blame

This town is getting so old
Drive away for the weekend
I'll try to bare you my soul
Last call for the weekend
Yeah, you know, I've tried, I've tried to fail
I've tried, I've tried to fail

There's nothing I should fear in loving you
I'm afraid this time that I'll be losing you
While I watch you, watch you go
While I watch you, watch you go

We are haunted
Come closer to hear my name
You're disheartened, you'll change, you'll stay the same
You know, I've tried my best to fail
I've tried, I've tried to fail

There's nothing I should fear in loving you
I'm afraid this time that I'll be losing you
While I watch you, watch you go
While I watch you, watch you go

While the cold night air starts to glow
Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go
While the cold night air starts to glow
Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go

There's nothing I should fear in loving you
Call it easy, call it more than I can do
I'm afraid that I'll be losing you
While I watch you, watch you go
There's nothing I should fear in loving you
I'm afraid this time that I'll be losing you
While I watch you, watch you go
While I watch you, watch you go

Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go
Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go
Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go
Watch you go, watch you go, watch you go
