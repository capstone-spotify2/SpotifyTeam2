I live to work and work to live
Oh, but what I wouldn't give
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach
Where the sand dollar is the only currency

I vote we go to the Gulf of Mexico
You and me by the sea
Palm trees call me, that's the place I want to be
Down where the southern breezes blow
On the Gulf of Mexico

Right at five o'clock today
I'll pick you up, we'll drive away
And I can't wait to feel the sand beneath my toes
And I can almost see the sunburn on your nose

I vote we go to the Gulf of Mexico
You and me by the sea
Palm trees call me, oh, that's the place I want to be
Down where the southern breezes blow
On the Gulf of Mexico

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, hmm

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Vamos, we go to the Gulf of Mexico
You and me by the sea
Palm trees call me, oh, that's the place I want to be
Down where the southern breezes blow
On the Gulf of Mexico

Down where the southern breezes blow
On the Gulf of Mexico...
