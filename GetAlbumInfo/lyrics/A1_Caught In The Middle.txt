<i>[Paul:]</i> You said that love was just a state of mind 
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time 
I was blind. 

<i>[Christian:]</i> And everything that you meant to me 
Is written in the pages of my history 
But it's over now as far as i can see 
Suddenly 

<i>[Ben:]</i> Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 

<i>[Mark:]</i> Moving on she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that i can't erase 
It's here to stay 

<i>[Ben:]</i> Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 

<i>[All:]</i> So different 
(<i>[Mark:]</i> it's so different) 
So easy 
(<i>[Paul:]</i> so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
(<i>[Ben:]</i> i can't get over you) 
So different 
(<i>[Paul:]</i> it's so different) 
So easy 
(<i>[Mark:]</i> so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
(<i>[Ben:]</i> and i can't get over you) 

<i>[Ben:]</i> Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 

<i>[Ben:]</i> Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
<i>[All:]</i> And now i'm caught 
<i>[Ben:]</i> And now, i'm caught in the middle 

<i>[Ben:]</i> Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
And now i'm caught 
Caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
And now, i'm caught in the middle
