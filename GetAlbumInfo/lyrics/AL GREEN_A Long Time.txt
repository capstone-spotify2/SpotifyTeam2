A long time has come and gone
I've seen more than I should
You know I've seen it all
There's never been lack
For the marks on my back
Said a long time has come and gone
My hope is God for tomorrow
No more tears
Say goodbye to sorrow
In the middle of the desert
Said He would spring forth a well
My hope is in God for tomorrow

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
God shed His grace on me

I don't want to cry no more
I pour out my heart
Now I'm walking out the door
I don't want to cry no more

Somebody's got to help me please
For more than twenty years
My eyes been filled with tears
A long time has come and gone
You don't know me well
There are surprises that I keep
I could never tell
You'll never know
A long time has come and gone
Seen more than I should
You know, I've seen it all
Never been lack for the marks on my back
A long time has come and gone
