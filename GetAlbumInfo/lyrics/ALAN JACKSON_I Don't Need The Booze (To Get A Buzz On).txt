Well I've been known to tie one on and honky tonk 'til half past three
But the party don't get started 'til my baby pours her love on me
She's a hundred proof, Lord she's smooth
She makes me moan all night long
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on

I've tried it all from Tennessee Whiskey
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
My Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love homegrown
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on

My little country girl makes my head whirl and my knees begin to shake
I can't walk a chalk line, I ain't a-talking or a-thinking straight
Yeah I'm hooked on my baby's love
There ain't nothing in a jug this strong
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on

I've tried it all from Tennessee Whiskey
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
My Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love homegrown
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on

I wear a Blue Ribbon grin every now and then
But I don't need that to get stoned
No I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
No I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
