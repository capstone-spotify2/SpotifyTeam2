You can package up a goodbye
You can tie a bow to a knot 
To make it pretty
Put mascara under my eyes
Doesn't mean that I haven't cried
And I'm not kidding
Fake it long enough
'Till my sadness wears off
I don't need to make much noise
I can change the tone of my voice
To make it happy

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Get used to it I won't hide
It's alright if I'm sad sometimes
This breaking is beautifully human
I'm not gonna fake I'm fine
I'll dance in my own time
This breaking is beautifully human
Stop saying that I gotta
Smile

Momma told me how to cry
When she cried the river dry
I'm still hurting
Hear them say it every time
Just be quiet, darling you're fine
I'm done hearing
Can you hear me now?
All my manners worn off
I'm not being very polite
Take a closer look in my eyes
Now I'm living

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Come out of hiding
And when you find me
I'll be realer 
Than you've ever known
Come out of hiding
And when you find me
I may be broken
But we won't break alone

Come out of hiding
And when you find me
I will be realer 
Than you've ever known
Come out of hiding
And when you find me
I may be broken
But we won't break alone

(Come out of hiding, and when you find me)
Get used to it I won't hide
It's alright if I'm sad sometimes
(Come out of hiding, and when you find me)
This breaking is beautifully human
I'm not gonna fake I'm fine
(Come out of hiding, and when you find me, I will be breaking)
I'll dance in my own time
(But we won't break alone)
This breaking is beautifully human
Come out of hiding
And when you find me
I may be broken
But we won't break alone
