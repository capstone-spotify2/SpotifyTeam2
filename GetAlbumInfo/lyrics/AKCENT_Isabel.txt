Even if I fall apart
Even if you cry
Even though I broke your heart
I won't say goodbye

So don't hate me tonight
Can't you see I'm right
So don't hate me tonight
Baby you are my light

Dear Isabelle
You ring my bell
Dear Isabelle
I will treat you well
Dear Isabelle

Even if I fall apart
Even if you cry
Even though I broke your heart
I won't say goodbye

So don't hate me tonight
Can't you see I'm right
So don't hate me tonight
Baby you are my light

Dear Isabelle
You ring my bell
Dear Isabelle
I will treat you well
Dear Isabelle
