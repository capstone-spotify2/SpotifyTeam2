If you walk with your head down
You can count every step you take
I know every place I've been now
I can count every mistake

I've been hurt so many times before
Almost forgotten how to dream
All that I was running from
Is all I need to save me

I couldn't let you in my heart
My defenses all fall apart
Just when I thought I'd given up
I have overcome

And now I can't let you go, oh no
You showed me something that I've never known
And finally I've found the one
I have overcome
I have overcome

You can never see it coming
There's always that one you can't count out
Who keeps on believing
Nothing's gonna stop me now

I've been hurt so many times before
Almost forgotten how to dream
All that I was running from
Is all I need to save me

I couldn't let you in my heart
My defenses all fall apart
Just when I thought I'd given up
I have overcome

And now I can't let you go, oh no
You showed me something that I've never known
And finally I've found the one
I have overcome

I'm not running anymore
'Cause now there's nothing left to hold me down
Some things are worth fighting for
I see it all, it's waiting for me now

I couldn't let you in my heart
My defenses all fall apart
Just when I thought I'd given up
I have overcome

And now I can't let you go, oh no
You showed me something that I've never known
And finally I've found the one
I have overcome

I couldn't let you in my heart, oh no
My defenses all fall apart
Just when I thought I'd given up
I have overcome

And now I can't let you go, oh no
You showed me something that I've never known
And finally I've found the one
I have overcome, I have overcome
