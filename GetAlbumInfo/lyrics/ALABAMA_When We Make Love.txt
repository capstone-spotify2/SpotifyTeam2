There's a light
In your eyes tonight,
You know I'd know that look anywhere.
You got plans
And I'm one lucky man.
Before we get so carried away
There's just something I've been wanting to say

When we make love,
It's more to me than just an affair,
I want you to know how much I care.
When we make love,
Oh, it's such a precious time,
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds.
When we make love.

Watching you,
Make your little moves.
I can tell it's gonna be a long night.
All day long,
We keep holdin' on.
It couldn't be any better than this,
I got it all at my finger tips.

When we make love,
Oh, it's more than just an affair,
I want you to know how much I care.
When we make love,
Oh, it's such a precious time,
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds.

These moments
These feelings
Mmmmmm

When we make love,
It's more to me than just an affair.
I want you to know how much I care.
When we make love,
Oh, it's such a precious time,
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds.

Now let's make love.
