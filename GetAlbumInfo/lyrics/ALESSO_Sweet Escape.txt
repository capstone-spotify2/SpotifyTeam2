We drive so far, to get away
Never look back, we don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, like a shooting star
Let the skyline guide us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down 
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now <i>[x4]</i>

All lights go out and fade away
Never lose faith, leave all of your fears behind
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, with an open heart
Let the sunshine find us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down 
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now <i>[x4]</i>

And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now
