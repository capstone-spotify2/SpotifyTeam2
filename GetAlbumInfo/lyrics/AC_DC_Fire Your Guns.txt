Wild beast
I'll make you mine
Taste your kiss
Sweet lips divine
She got moves, drips of sweat
She got eyes of blue, body curves, legs that'll break your nerves
Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you round
Yeah, you want some fun
Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns

That lady bites
Hard style
Drips of sex
Eyes are wild
She got moves
Long long legs
She got eyes of blue, body curves, Legs that'll shake the earth
Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you round
Yeah, you want some fun
Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns

Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you round
Yeah, you want some fun
Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns
Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns, Fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns
