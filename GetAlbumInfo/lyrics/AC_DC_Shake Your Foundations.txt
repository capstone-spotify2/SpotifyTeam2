See me leaning, on the bar
I got my head in a whiskey jar
Feeling good cause the city's alive
I'm getting ready to rock and jive
I get up and I slide across the floor
You wanna come an' I'll meet you at the door
No one can stop us cause we're feeling too right
We're gonna steal our way around tonight

Alright, alright
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it

I was taking, no liberties
She's getting hotter off the heat on me
I was oiling, she was slick
Licking off the sweat, her favourite trick
Help me, help me please, tame this animal, and help me to breathe
I said no, no way, you gotta come with me, all the way
OK I'll play

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it

We had the night, we had the time
She had the sugar and I had the wine
Took my hand shook me to the core
I told her not to touch but she was coming back for more
You know what for

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Make a sign
