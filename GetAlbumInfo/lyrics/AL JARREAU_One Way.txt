One thing will lead to another
one touch and I'm closer to you
Oh, how I yearn to discover
All of the things I need to do
to live, to live to live all life of luxury...
Holding you in my arms
your heart, your heart, your heart, your
heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
One way to win your affection
One way to make that connection
I believe there's one way to your love
Love for life is my affliction
You are my sublime addiction
I believe there's a way to your love

Should I stand on a mountain
Should I dream of you here
Oh, it pours from me like a fountain
still I can't have you near
to love, to love, to love, to love, to love
you like a jewel in my arms
your heart, your heart, your heart, your
heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

<i>[Chorus]</i>
