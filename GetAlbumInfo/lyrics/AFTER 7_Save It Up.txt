Hey girl I got it for ya'
In a real bad way
So baby you could push me 'round
Push me down your way
I don't care anywhere's good down there
But baby in the back of your mind
You want to feel me sliding up your leg
Oh yeah

Take your time
Let's make sure the feeling's right
I wanna know what's up
Should we stop or should we.

Save it up, save it up
Save it up for me baby
Shooby-doop you my baby
'cause you know you're just
Drivin' me crazy
Save it up baby love
Don't hold back your lovin'
Shooby-doop you my baby
'cause you know you just
Drivin' me crazy

Sweet thang candy got ya'meltin'
In your flame
'cause baby you're safe and warm
Given into the game
Oh way down there
Deep in your ocean way
Send me down there girl
I'll find your pearl
At the end of the day
Ease your mind
Let's make sure the mood's alright
I wanna fill your cup
So what's up or should we.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Baby what's your name
Come and let me see your love baby
I just wanna know your name
Baby what's your name
Come and show me your love
I just wanna give you game girl
I just want you baby, yeah

<i>[Chorus]</i>
