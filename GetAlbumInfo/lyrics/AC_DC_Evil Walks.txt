Black shadow hangin' over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison runnin' thru your veins
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you

Black widow weavin' evil notion
Dark secret's bein' spun in your web
Good men goin' down in your ocean
They can't swim cos their tied to your bed
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you
You're just crying wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom
Oh black widow

C'mon weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got 'em tied to your bed
With your dark dark secret's
And your green green eyes
You black widow

Evil, walks behind you
Evil, sleeps beside you
Evil, talks arouse you
Evil, walks behind you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you

Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks

You're so bad
