I had a vision that the colours had bled away
and I had nothing to follow
Was in a prison and my life was stuck on replay
And all my wishes were hollow

You were a beam of light
Lit up my broken sky
There was just something about you
I had a vision and it painted the world for me
And now I'm laying beside you

I don't need to wander any more
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at

Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map, you'll always light the path

The dawn is bright and
My perception is open wide
You know you flooded my senses
What you inspire is a feeling I can't describe
Forgotten all my defences

You were a beam of light
Lit up my broken sky
There was just something about you, ooh
I had a vision and you painted the world for me
And now I'm staying beside you

I don't need to wander any more
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at

Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map, you'll always light the path

Follow me
I believe, I believe, I believe in more than I can see
I believe, I believe, I believe in more than I can see

Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map you'll always light the path
