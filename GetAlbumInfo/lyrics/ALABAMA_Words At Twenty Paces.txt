Just like a western movie
A challenge has been made
A shot was fired in anger
And pride stepped off the train
Won't we ever stop this
Killin', me and you,
Till our hearts are up on Boot Hill
And there's nothing we can do.

Words at twenty paces,
Anger at high noon
This house ain't big enough
For both of us it's comin' soon
We'll finish off our happiness
And run hope out of town
With words at twenty paces,
Lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.

How did we ever lose
The dreams we used to share
The gentle touch, the words of love,
The way we used to care
Sometimes you words
Cut like a bullet in my side
Oh, which is more important,
Wounded hearts or wounded pride.

I've got my ammunition
I know you've got yours too
We know each other's weakness
Lord, the damage we can do
Why can't we just step aside
And put our guns away
Let love come like the cavalry
Ride in and save the day.

Words at twenty paces,
Anger at high noon
This house ain't big enough
For both of us it's comin' soon
We'll finish off our happiness
And run hope out of town
With words at twenty paces,
Lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.

Words at twenty paces,
Anger at high noon
This house ain't big enough for
Both of us it's comin' soon
We'll finish off our happiness
And run hope out of town
With words at twenty paces,
Lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.

Words at twenty paces...
