Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash
I can't do nothin' right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down

Beaten by a blind bend
Wrong way up a dead end
Screamin' through a speed trap
As I tear into a tail back
You know I can't do nothin' right
No I never sleep at night
And I can't even start a fight
Well my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
It keeps a tumblin' down
C'mon slide

I'm slippin' down
I got my hands in the fire

I'm slidin' on a oil slick
Burnin' on a bad trip
Yes and nothin's gonna change it
No I can't do nothin' right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down, down down
Spellbound
My world
Keeps a tumblin'
Down
