i work all week it's Friday night
there's a place i go to get down right
beer's cold and the girls are fine
and everybody says hey y'all
bangagong
get your boots on
'cause you ain't been too long gone
to get tour boots on
bumpin', grindin' all night long
to every alan jackson song
it's a honky tonkin' party time
everybody here says hey y'all
bangagong
get your boots on
'cause you ain't been too long gone
to get your boots on

we'll be
ridin', ropin', rockin', rollin'
just singin' a cowboby song
twistin', jumpin', turnin', bumpin'
just hearin' everybody say hey y'all
bangagong get your boots on
