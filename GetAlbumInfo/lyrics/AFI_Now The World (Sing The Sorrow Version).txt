Summer I painted, a scene, that lit the stars for me,
Said, "I can erase it for you dear."
That summer created, those words, that came to life in three,
They were denied by you.
Summer I laid down, below, the glitter adorned night,
And silently sparkled, my own way.
Summer I laid down, by you, and shared my frail light,
You gave the dark to me.

I looked inside,
(I)
To find,
(Wanted)
The one I sent away.
(To insinuate)
I nearly froze, when I stepped inside,
(I)
To find,
(Remain)
The flowers turned to Grey.
(I self mutilate)
I closed my eyes, and kissed them one last time.

Summer a morning, so pale, alone when they found me,
As I remained sleeping, I heard them say,
"This summer created, a boy, of abject misery."
He was designed by you.
(He was designed by you)

I looked inside,
(I)
To find,
(Wanted)
The one I sent away.
(To insinuate)
I nearly froze, when I stepped inside,
(I)
To find,
(Remain)
The flowers turned to Grey.
(And self mutilate)
I closed my eyes, and kissed them..

So like a lost child,
I will hide.
And like lost lie,
I will find.

Find a way to return to the ones who made me,
Cover your eyes and we'll die together.

Will you fly for me,
Will you fly for me,
Or will you die with me?

Will you cry for me,
Will you cry for me,
Or will you die with me?

Will you cry for me,
(I've been a lonely one)
Will you fly for me,
(I've had this whole world)
Or will you die with me?
(Drained from me)

Will you cry for me,
(Am I the only one)
Will you fly for me,
(I've had this world)
Or will you die with me?
(Drained from me, drained from me.)

Summer I painted, a scene, that lit the stars for me,
Said, "I can erase it for you dear."
