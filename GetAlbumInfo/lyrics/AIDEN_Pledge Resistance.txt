Let's show this world we can be alright, 
without it's sponsors word 
I think my mind is almost washed, 
America might change it's time line if 
the media fucked off 
and quit filling kids with lies.
I just can't let this record play (playnowIcan'tfind)
cause I feel like the masses are quietly lied to, 
and they don't discuss the way (waynowIcan'tfind)
we treat foriegn country's who oppose our policy 
And I feel (andIfeel) 
so hollow 
like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 
And I feel (andIfeel) 
so hollow 
this pledge of resistance is about to start now,
I just can't sing this song with out (withoutmyheartIfeelso) 
my heart cause I'm so alive ya I'm so alive
and I know this empire is run on (faithinanempirenow)
fear and this greed sets apart from innocence 
And I feel (andIfeel) 
so hollow 
like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 
And I feel (andIfeel) 
so hollow 
this pledge of resistance is about to start NOW,
(Now)-This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now wont you
This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now wont you
"We have nailed our names in the pages of history enough for today"
Let's light this world on fire
and watch it burn
Let's light this world on fire
