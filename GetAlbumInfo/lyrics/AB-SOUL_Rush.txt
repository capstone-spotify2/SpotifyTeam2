"This Northwood, this is where I slumber at. You know what I'm saying?"

I got my mind on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush... Rush

I was on Avalon, in a Avalon
With the window down, two notche for TV on
Yeah, thatâs what he be on
California sunshine, heater on
I laid the text but sometimes niggas read it wrong
Still a slave to the page, no beeper on
If the sky tell lies then let me lie (where?)
In the same home that the reaper own
Fire, feel the degrees rising in this song
Keep the degree pollutin' your speakers till Iâm gone
Became a tree, mama your seed is growin'
Niggas see me, see where Iâm going
Uphill, and I keep going
Through the red lights, through the roadblocks
My headlights blind the opposition
Ainât got 200 on the dash but Iâm doing half

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
Iâm always in a rush

Rolling down central, in a bucket but Iâm feeling presidential
Breaking down swishaâs, filling 'em with indo
Hoâs trying to date a nigga like info's
Iâm flying right by 'em like holla back
Hoping they wonât see me through the tinted windows
Bending corners like I ainât got a bookmark
Ainât got the most paper but Iâm booksmart
Iâm speeding through life like fuck it all (My nigga)
I got my word and my fuckings balls (My nigga)
And thatâs my word Iâm a fucking ball (My nigga)
Control the earth so I can have a ball (My nigga)
Iâm moving at a fast pace and I ainât slowing up for Nathan
Paparazzi follow me but they canât keep up the tape
You ainât talking longterm and you ainât talking my language
Donât trip, we still popping like a stainless
Fo' real

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
Iâm always in a rush

Del Amo, Del Amo
Eyes on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush.... Rush
