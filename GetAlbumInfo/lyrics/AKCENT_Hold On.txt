Hold on to your love
Don't let go
Hold on to your dreams,
Dreams and hopes baby
Fight with me, 'cause destiny
Every fear, every cry was in vein
Every smile, always lost
If you leave me be, you're
losing me and us
Oooooooooh
Just hold on the memories in your heart
listen to the silence
Hold on and bring my love tonight
Hold on to me my baby <i>[2x]</i>
Hold on to our love,
Don't let go
Hold on to our dreams,
Dreams and hopes baby
Fight with me,
'Cause destiny
Every fear, every cry was in vein
Every smile, always lost
If you leave me be, you're
losing me and us
Oooooooooh
Hold on the memories in your heart
Listen to the silence
Hold on and bring my love tonight
Hold on to me my baby <i>[2x]</i>
Just hold on the memories in your heart
Listen to the silence
Hold on and bring my love tonight
Hold on to me my baby
Hold on to me my baby...
