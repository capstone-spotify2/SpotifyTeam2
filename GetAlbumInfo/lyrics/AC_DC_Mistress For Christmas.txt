Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the day
I just can't wait till Christmas time
When I can roll em' in the hay

Easy come, easy go
Have a good time, with lots of dough
Slippin' up high, slippin' down low
Love 'em and leave 'em, on with the show

I like female form, in minimum dress
Money to spend with a capital "S"
Get a date with the woman in red
Wanna be in heaven with three in a bed
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, but it don't matter
She got it and I can't get it
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress
For Christmas

Easy come, easy go
Slippin' high, slippin' low
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
I want it, don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it
He got it, and I want it
They got it, and I can't have it
But I want it, it don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it
Mistress for Christmas, you know what I'm talking about
Mistress for Christmas, they're gonna send me down, send me down
Mistress for Christmas, I want the woman in red at the bottom of my bed
Mistress for Christmas

I can hear you coming down my snow stick

I wanna ride on your reindeer honey
And ring the bells
