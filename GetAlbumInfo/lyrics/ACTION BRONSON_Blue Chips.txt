<i>[Ed Axley:]</i> "I gotta ask this question or I wouldnât be doing my job...
Would you care to comment on the rumor that you arranged for an automobile to be purchased for (Action Bronson)?"
<i>[Pete Bell:]</i> "You know- You know, Ed, you just gotta get your mind out of the gutter
You know, you- you just gotta start thinking straight
I mean, itâs right there in front of you
For Christâs sake it wasnât an automobile, I mean, it was a fully loaded Lexus!"
