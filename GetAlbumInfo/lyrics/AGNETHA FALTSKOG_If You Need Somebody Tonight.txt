If you need somebody tonight
Here I am, here I am,
If it's love you need in your life
Here I am tonight.

If you want somebody to hold
Take my hand, take my hand,
If the night is getting too cold
Take my hand tonight.

I will hold you, I will love you,
I will be there right beside you,
You will never be lonely again.
If your heart is missing someone
Here I am, here I am.

If you need somebody tonight
I will hold you, I will love you,
I will be right there right beside you,
You will never be lonely again.

If you want a love that is strong
Here I stand, here I stand,
In my arms is where you belong
If you need somebody tonight.

If your heart is missing someone
Here I am, here I am,
And if what you need is my love
Here I am tonight, here I am tonight
