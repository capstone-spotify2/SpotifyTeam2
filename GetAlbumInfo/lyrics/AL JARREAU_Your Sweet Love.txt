And when I thought
my flame was out
You entered in

I look around
I feel the same as before
I'm on the ground
I'm dreaming away, but you know
I would trade all of
my daydreams for
some wings
A sparrow sings

The thrill was gone
But like the summer
The spring
Will bring the dawn
And I'll be singing your song
For a wondrous new change is
Taking me up to heaven

Your sweet love -
brighter than light -
Streaking like a starship -
Your sweet love -
brightens the night -
Gleaming down on our ship
Your sweet love -
making me realize
That heaven is right
here in your eyes

I look around
It's not the same as before
I'm on the ground
But now I'm singing your song
For this wondrous new change
Is taking me up to heaven

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

<i>[Instrumental and Voice]</i>

And when I thought
my flame was out
You entered in

I thank the stars
But you know as often
I thank the things you are
And all I offer
Just longs for that wondrous
new change
That's taking me up to heaven

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

I found my lucky star
Was gleaming nightly
Your love in starlight
Screaming 'round the bend
