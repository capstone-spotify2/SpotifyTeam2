It's a brand new day, it's never too late to start
Can't live this life with an empty heart

Every single time that we lay it on the line
It's a roller coaster ride for one
When you know it's do or die and you're running out of time
We gotta give it all we've got
All we've got

I want something more, a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason, to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Let's burn a little bit brighter now

Sometimes we gotta risk it all to chase a dream
It's a dive in head first, all-or-nothing kind of thing

Every single time that we lay it on the line
It's a roller coaster ride for one
When you know it's do or die and you're running out of time
We gotta give it all we've got

I want something more, a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason, to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Let's burn a little bit brighter now

Can't stand by and wait like the others
I'm front line and won't run for cover
Head held high cause I'm burning brighter
Yeah I'm burning brighter

Can't stand by and wait like the others
I'm front line and won't run for cover
Head held high cause I'm burning brighter

I want something more, a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason, to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Lets burn a little bit brighter now
It's a brand new day, it's never too late to start
