Bang to this

They are looking at me
Whispering my name
Cause when I walk into the room
Yeah, that's my stage

Watch my body carefully
You can't take your eyes off me
Memorized when I walk to bass

Is she real, love?
Is she a dream?
She's such,

You can see it in my strut (uh-huh)
When I walk up in the club (uh-huh)
Light up like an electric shock (uh-huh)
You can see it in my strut
Str-str-strut, str-str-strut, str-str

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut

Like a queen, I'm walking to my throne
I know you wishing numbers ringing in my phone
Oh, who does she think she is?
Looking like she's only missed
Watch me work, work it on the floor

Is she real, love?
Is she a dream?
She's such,

You can see it in my strut (uh-huh)
When I walk up in the club (uh-huh)
Light up like an electric shock (uh-huh)
You can see it in my strut
Str-str-strut, str-str-strut, str-str

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut

Gimme, gimme, gimme this Bud light
Gimme, gimme, gimme the dance floor
Show me, show me, show me the green light
Tell me, tell me, tell me you want more

Gimme, gimme, gimme this Bud light
Gimme, gimme, gimme the dance floor
Show me, show me, show me the green light
Tell me, tell me, tell me you want more

Is she real, love?
Is she a dream?
She's such

You can see it in my strut (uh-huh)
When I walk up in the club (uh-huh)
Light up like an electric shock (uh-huh)
You can see it in my strut
Str-str-strut, str-str-strut, str-str

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

All the girls, we want to party
We put on our heal and strut
We don't want to hurt nobody
We put on our heal and strut

We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
We put on, heal put on, heal put on
Heal and strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut
Strut, strut, strut, strut, strut

The night is housing
And we have nothing to lose
I feel so good inside

And when I hear that sound
It'll make me move
I can't control my mind
