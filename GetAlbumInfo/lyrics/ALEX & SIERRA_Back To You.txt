Are you lonely? Do you miss me anymore?
Is your heart as empty as these arms that used to hold you?
Are you tired? Are you weaker than before?
Are you sinking? Cause I've been thinking that there's something missing
Mmm, it's you

Oh, it's you

Now I'm without you
I'm feeling insecure about the little things
I guess the little things were what we lost
But all I remember brings me back to you and all those little things
I'm not anything without you

I grew tired of all the empty promises
You held me up to a place so high
But I'm down in the ground and there's no one around
All this love that I gave to you
In your arms I asked you to kiss me
Over and over again

Now I'm without you
I'm feeling insecure about the little things
I guess the little things were what we lost
But all I remember brings me back to you and all those little things
I'm not anything without you

And your mind's wandering out the door
And your body's got nowhere to fall
And it seems so clear but your heart's not sure

Now I'm without you
I'm feeling insecure about the little things
I guess the little things were what we lost
But all I remember brings me back to you and all those little things
I'm not anything

But all I remember brings me back to you, without those little things
We're not anything
