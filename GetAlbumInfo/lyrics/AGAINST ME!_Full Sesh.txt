Do you bite your tongue when you hear them say?
Do you bite your tongue and wait for your chance? 
Do you bite your tongue and push thought from mind? 
Focus is Locked, Attention is fixed.

Do you want to battle with me?
You cannot match determination like this.

Do you bide your time so patiently?
Do you bide your time and wait for your chance?
Do you bide your time and keep intent hidden?
When the strike comes it's going to be deadly.

Do you want to battle with me?
Like a whore plotting revenge on the trick.

Do you want to battle with me?
In the end I will win.
