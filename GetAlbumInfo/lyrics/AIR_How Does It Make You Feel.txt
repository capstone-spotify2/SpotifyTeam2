I am feeling very warm right now
Please don't disappear
I am spacing out with you
You are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed of

At night I will protect you in your dreams
I will be your angel
You worry so much about not having enough time together
It makes no difference to me
I would be happy with just one minute in your arms
Let's have an extended play together
You're telling me that we live to far to love each other
But your love can stretch further than you and I can see
So how does it make you feel? 

How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 

Do you know when you look at me
It is a salvation
I've been waiting for you so long
I can drive on that road forever
I wish you could exist to live on my planet
Well it's very hard for me to say these things in your presence
So how does it make you feel? 

How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 
How does it make you feel? 

So how does it make you feel? 
Well, I really think you should quit smoking
