Amen

Sleeping little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas morning
Singing in the temple
Talking with the elders
Tomorrow there's wisdom
Down at the Jordan
John was babtizing
And saving all the sinners
Singing at the seaside
Talking with the fishermen
He made them deciples
Saving all sinners
Keep on pushing now
Tomorrow there's wisdom
