You've been smiling lately baby
You've been singing in the bath
You've been acting like a lady
Not a dirty photograph
Then tonight you came home early
Packed a bag or two
It's been worrying me honey
Just what you're gonna do

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around

Well you came on like a hurricane
About a month ago
Blowing like a stiff breeze
Always on the go
All the good times that we had
All stayed in the past
All the good lays that I get
Never seem to last

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around
(Come on baby, sit on this)

What have I been doing lately
To make you wanna go
I take you out dancing
Honey we can go out to a show
Spend a night romancing
Nights out on the town
Listen to me baby
You'll be glad you stopped around

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around
