Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet
Screamer, dreamer, disarray
Gypsy, gypsy, why did you fly away

No good, papa's no good
Sister's no good and that's a drag
Sometimes you're feelin'
Like your head's on the ceiling
When you scream hey mama...rag
When your daddy come home
With an old soup bone
'Cause he drank all the money away
And your mama's in the kitchen
On the phone she be bitchin'
And your girlfriend who called to say

Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet
Screamer, dreamer, disarray
Gypsy, gypsy, why did you fly away

High school lover, with ya corpse undercover
Gettin high jack...Lebanese
Hey mama, choosed it, y'all all been through it
Or be fallin' off you right to your knees
(Pair a shades, shotgun, rock on) ?
Chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight
Your a (love hate) ? child with wild child smile
And you don't care wrong from right

Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet
Screamer, dreamer, disarray
Gypsy, gypsy, why did you fly away

Nobody but nobody baby
Knockin' my socks off
Rock, rock, rockin'
I'll be gotten, I'll be gettin' my rocks off
Nobody but nobody shootin' 
never gets a shot off
Yeah, yeah, yeah
