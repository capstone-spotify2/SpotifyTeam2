I wonder how do you do
And should I come back to you
I've been thinking
I wonder how do you do
And should I come back to you

I was lonely, sad and so distracted
I took a highway
It was the low way in disguise
There because only
My love had chain reacted
There was a detour 'long the way -
With a soft shoulder toll to pay -
Leaving me a-lonely
Sad and so distracted

I was lonely, so sad and so distracted
Taking the freeway but when I broke free
I closed my eyes
Mama, please hold me real close 'cause
I've been fractured

There was a detour along the way
With a soft shoulder toll to pay
Leavin' me a-lonely,
Sad and so distracted

Notice the teardrops running down on
my cheek
Notice the laughter
Making it loud's a good disguise
Taking my heartaches for a little ride
on main street

There was a detour 'long the way
Just another heart that stalled today
Leaving me a-lonely, sad and so
distracted

(Play your horn, play on your horn)

There was a detour 'long the way
Just another heart that stalled today
Leaving me a-lonely, sad and so
distracted
