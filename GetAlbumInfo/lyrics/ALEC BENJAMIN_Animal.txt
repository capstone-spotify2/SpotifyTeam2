And the wheels go round and round
And the headlights shining fade in, fade out
And the cigarette burns, burns, burns
And the cigarette burns, burns, burns
I don't care, cause I'm wasted
I don't care, cause I'm wasted
And the road goes up in smoke
So I paint a picture in my head where I'm supposed to go
I don't care, cause I'm wasted
I don't care, cause I'm wasted
And the wheels go round and round

And I am an animal
I am an animal
And you can't control my brain
And that makes it impossible
I am an animal

And the voices take their toll
So you're waiting, and you hope that they'd let you go
You don't care, cause you're floating
You don't care, cause you're floating
And the wheels go round and round

And I am an animal
I am an animal
And you can't control my brain
And that makes it impossible
I am an animal

So we will get drunk
And we make love
And we make break up
And you wake up
Over again
And the wheels go round and round

And I am an animal
I am an animal
And you can't control my brain
And that makes it impossible
I am an animal
