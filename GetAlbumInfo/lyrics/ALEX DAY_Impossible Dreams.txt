This land's so alien to me
But I just felt comfortable here
And now I don't know the way home
I don't know where I'm trying to go

The streets here have numbers
The buildings in blocks
But none of the street signs are pointing to you
I've seen a whole different world

The sky's getting darker, the air's getting cooler
And I just can't win anymore
So forgive me, my darling
We all have impossible dreams

I tried so many new things
Smashes don't matter against memories
Seems that I made the wrong choice
I'd say sorry but I have no voice

To tell you that decisions are hard
And my world is so small
Nothing matters unless you're satisfied
Who else can I share my chai with

Now the sky's getting darker, the air getting cooler
And I just can't win anymore
So forgive me, my darling
We all have impossible dreams

I don't know much of my life
But I know I want people to know
Maybe I might sing along
As if this was only a song

But now the sky's getting darker, the air getting cooler
And I just can't win anymore
So forgive me, my darling
