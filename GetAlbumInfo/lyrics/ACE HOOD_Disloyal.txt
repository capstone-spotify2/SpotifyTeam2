Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you
My niggas loyal
Can only say that 'bout a few
That's the truth,
He was the homie
Until he ratted on the crew
We got a problem,
We gotta figure out the truth
Was it you?

Snitchin' niggas get buried
Young niggas be killers,
Choppers leavin' my bed,
Fuck you with your feelings
Ain't no talking to the police, never turn on my pix
Loyalty for my dogs, nigga MOB
Still gotta wash the people you round,
Post them niggas playin' them down
These looking smile with you and talking bout you
Everytime you're not around
Boy that's whole shit to the finest,
What the fuck you on em,
All my niggas on papers,
All about that drama,
Wait! Huh, oh you ain't no,
How do not trust me nobody you know?
Family close, enemies close, the reason I ride em I creep em to toaster
That's on the law, never you know, it could be police that selling you dope
Someone you nigga they work for the folks
Just letting you know
