There's a place on the corner of the street
Where we go to have a drink and a smoke sometimes
And the people there talk about someone who looks like you
Seems they've seen you with somebody else
Tell me baby is that the truth

Well now tell me babe am I the last to know
Did you think I that I'd never find out
It's time I did some walking
Cause you know why
On the street
Somebody's talking

Yeah
Cause I hear rumors
Rumors of you
While I'm picking up my heart
Seems you've found somebody new
Looking for us deep down here
Well let me tell you about rumors

Well now don't believe a word they say
Cause they don't know a thing about trust
You know how people keep talking
Yeah well your talking up petty lies
So forget about us

Cause I hear rumors
Rumors of you
While I'm here picking up my heart
Seems you've found somebody new 
Just looking for us deep down here
Let me tell you about rumors

Making a scene

Rumors

Cause they say you've been fooling around
I was picking up the pieces of my heart
You should know all there is
Even took some time

Well I hear rumors
Rumors of you
I'm here falling apart
Seems you've found somebody new
Looking for use deep down here

Well those rumors
Rumors of you
See you're doing it all over again

I just hope that someday
You get yours
In the end
Well let me tell you about rumors
They never seem to end
I'm tired of rumors
It's you in the end
