Yeah
Yeah NASA let's try this
Ah

Park your bets, sharks or jets
These bark mark targets where the barnacles nest
They burrow deep under the carnivores flesh without a trace,
Carnival games, like try to shoot the star out of a space

Come double fist them awkward gats lockbox your passin'
Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics
Walk off with a thumbs up and a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket
Pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day (yeah, that's the ticket)

Yeah, that's the pipe dream that hater 101 bitch picks
Living guilt trips for the fan-based family picnics
Whose handshake carry with it
Y'all inspire me, it's an honor to meet you
Now its randomly fantasy beef stew, thats panicky preschool
That's peak re-signed Pikachu when he's pokin' Pinocchi beezer
Where Big Brother watch me, holler back Wally Cleaver
Knobby-kneed geezer whose brittle paddleboat sank
Wishing he could restitch the images when the kinescope cranked -
He couldn't. You can't.
I'm more than two lambs with a Mongoloid loyalty clause
And a done-did-got-busy ambiance
That's Laserface, Megalasaur, Scissor-tongue, Liftedly, Money Murs Ramble, Printmatic, Hanger, Blockhead and Ravipops
And the fam only begins with the last two bars he dropped
After chrome fangs I'll rewrite Heavy Metal Parking Lot
That's why these grapevines can pop shit to me all day,
I only kick these fucking doors down and make sure the crew OK, like
Food on the plate, pat on the back, kicks on the palette
I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets
While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge
Who light girls and misconstrued the lucky fuckloaders for talent
It's sad really... ok, I'm over it -

Smolder over composure models like
Smoke over soldier nostrils
3-D bifocal goggle broke over catwalkers
There must have been something up in that Long Island tap water
Thru the mute wind storm the hoover and his frisky sissy poodle pack
Oozing that hollow oodle-mac act Ace threw back in junior rap -
Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols when the whole reason you liked em's cuz their shit wasn't recycled?
Caught pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't hurtin', thats no burden
Need attention? Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses
Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin,
Perching little man behind curtain opinions - this is perfect
I'm just like y'all, living low-pro to paycheck
When the landlord hollers they hid the dro in the tape deck
Rocket radio, every success smidgen he harnessed
Parks with wrist and sick wit it clickin' in perfect working ratio
What risk he added dodge blame game for sneaky plots
With elevated rung placement derived from deep rooted jealousy issues
They cued a raging bull and every due is paid in full
With that I'll forget all you motherfucks that fail to pull
Why? well, what's really good?
Not a catcher peddled backwards for a hacker's filthy looks
Hodge-podge phenomenon, muppets available in rubber stamp form
Hogwash Harry clamp norm
Wear the space cape baker, order up
Herbert's pacemaker and vacate personal space in relation to face breaker
Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to ideate with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins
Probably when Ozzy's friends slept on the poppy stems
Horseback 60 mph, one hand rollin tobacky badly
But it burns that cavalry of concerned worms for Mayor
But you'll find validity in a penny -
Right, and I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off Yeti

With a kneejerk response to his budgetary woes
Use hooky out the institute since huckleberry molds
Styled after the Hermann Rorschach margin mark
Starvin' art smash see the slashed martyr hark
Trapped in the lap for garter belt
This is sick flash Definitive Jux baby
We like, 'love it or leave it out your hollerbox now'
Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit
You're spillin insignificant frijoles
