Always said I wanna go be on my own
I never said that the pain just wouldn't subside
Caught between a house and a broken home
Evil thoughts been running through my mind

That's when it all came down
And everything around turned grey
The pain will stop... but will it stop for me?

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?

I can see it written on their face
Run down from all of the problems and pain
Lights are on and we don't hear no sound
Rock bottom and there's no one helpin' me out

That's when it all came down
And everything around turned grey
The pain will stop... but will it stop for me?

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?

Here I am, let me know
There I go, turn away
Here I am, let me know
There I go, turn away

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?

Waiting for tonight
You can find the words to say
I can barely breathe
How will I move on?
