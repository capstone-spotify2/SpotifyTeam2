Most people would break the chair but I been rockin it
Blown up putting kerosene on my cigarette

Cast a light to my future, pull a plug on my past
But to get here you ain't gotta even look at the math
Easy as that but if you really into the facts

Add the highs subtract the lows we find the answer and we gox2
