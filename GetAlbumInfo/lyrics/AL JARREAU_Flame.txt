So close and yet so smart
Head first before the heart
Ain't no shame
Ain't no game
With the flame

Coldwaters rush in March
No place for April flowers
Take her name
Say she came
With the flame

I've been told
When the stars all align
That even bitter lips like mine
Will call the moon a friend &amp; kiss again
Some I'm told
Let their hearts read the signs
While other men are hungerin
And can't let it in

Be still my foolish heart
Please don't upset the cart
Stay the same
Ain't no game
With the flame

I've been told
I'll be dancin' in time
Walkin' rhythm talkin' rhyme
The earth will turn and send the sun again
All my gold
For a light or a sign
Some kind of kin
To say my friend
Let it out - let it in

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame
The flame <i>[2x]</i>
