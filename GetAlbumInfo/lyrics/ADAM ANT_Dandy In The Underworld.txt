Prince of Players, Pawn of none
Born with steel reins on the heart of the Sun
Gypsy explorer of the New Jersey Heights
Exalted companion of T-Rex nights 

Cos he's a 
Oh he's a
He's a Dandy in the Underworld
Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
Oh, will anybody ever care 

Now he's only eighteen, in exile he was
To the deserted kingdoms of a mythical boss
Distraction he wanted, to destruction he fell
Now he forever stalks the ancient
Mansions of hell

Cos he's a 
Oh he's a
He's a Dandy in the Underworld
A Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
Oh, will anybody ever care 

Now his lovers have left him
And his youth is ill spent
He cries in the dungeons, tries to repent
Change is a m-m-monster and changing is hard
So he'll freeze away summers in his
Underground yard

Cos he's a Dandy in the Underworld
Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
He's a Dandy in the Underworld
Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
Oh, will anybody ever care 

He's a Dandy in the Underworld
Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
He's a Dandy in the Underworld
Dandy in the Underworld
When will he come up for air,
Oh, will anybody ever care 

Don't you ever, don't you ever,
Stop being dandy, showing me you're handsome
