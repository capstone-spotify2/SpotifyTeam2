<i>[Intro:]</i>
Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
I can't even take a piss without a nigga trying to take a pic
I just want to fuck a few hoes, take my pick
Backwoods with the hash in 'em bad bitch, skinny jeans, fat ass in 'em
You ain't never seen a lime of light
I might fuck around and do a line tonight
Codine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fucking to the Weeknd, on the weekend
That ain't too provocative, is it?
If it's not, that's just a warning
You know I got it if you want
No, I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No this shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something

<i>[Hook:]</i>
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
It's always something
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights

Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
We in the world of material vixens in your videos
Hermes belt, shirt will make your ho melt
Issey Miyake all over my body
My heart beats off beat, still the life of the party
YSL, iPhone wireless cell
I'm high as hell, by the end of the night
I might need bail if a nigga test my mic
I ain't a bitch for nothing, end of discussion
And I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No that shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something
