This is my wish for everybody in the world
To have peace and happiness
And all the love that they deserve

To every mother, every father
Every baby child <i>[?]</i>
This is my Christmas prayer

To all those who are hungry
May they never miss a meal
All the broken hearted may they find a way to heal

And all the homeless and the needy
That they might have a coat to wear
This is my Christmas prayer

From my little house upon Valance Street
I'm sending out these hopes to high above
That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race

From Lafayette to London
From Buenos Aires to Beijing
Let's be kind to one another
And let that yuletide spirit ring

Spread the message and the meaning
Of the season everywhere
This is my Christmas prayer

From my little house upon Valance Street
I'm sending out these hopes to high above
That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race

This is my wish, it may be a lot to ask
But I'm hoping that a miracle
Will finally come to pass

And that all that I am saying
Are just whispers in the air
This is my Christmas, this is my Christmas
This is my Christmas prayer
