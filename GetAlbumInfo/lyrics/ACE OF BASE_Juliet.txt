Juliet 
A girl you never should have met 
Oh, Juliet 
She acted like sheâs never seen your face before 
Itâs not funny honey when you try 
and sheâs not even willing to learn 
Itâs not funny honey when youâre only after money 
Could you ever try to earn? 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
So, Howzat! 
Whatâs up a bright and clear new summer day 
Well, Howzat! 
Wake up and breath the air and sail away 
So, Howzat! 
Whatâs up now, donât you worry night and day 
Always remember, donât you remember me? Yeah

Juliet, 
how could she ever you forget 
Oh, Juliet 
She acted like sheâs never seen your face before 
Itâs not funny honey when you try 
and sheâs not even willing to learn 
Itâs not funny honey when youâre on your own 
And the pages never turn

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Never meant to hurt you 
But thatâs just the way it went 
Itâs not my intention 
pretending to be Heaven Saint 
Juliet, whatâs up a bright and clear new summer day 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Juliet
