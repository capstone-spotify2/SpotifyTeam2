You see me as a judge
Though I deny it
And hold me like a grudge
Then justify it

But when you take such pains
In searching for something that explains
Please, take a good look at our remains

Cause if you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And maybe there's room for compromise
But signs that I get say otherwise
Say anything, cause I've heard everything

As hopeless as it seems
I wouldn't worry
You'll get your chance to tell
Your side of the story

While you're raising your right hand
Whatever defenses you had planned
Remember that when you take the stand

If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And though I'd be happy to believe
I'd have to be much more naive

Say anything, I've heard everything...

Now I've heard everything...

So why do I refuse
The truth, when I clearly cannot use
The comfort of one more lame excuse

Cause if you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And if you were everything you swear
We wouldn't be beyond repair
If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And if there has got to be an if
Get it over with

Say anything, 'cause I've heard everything... 

Now I've heard everything...
