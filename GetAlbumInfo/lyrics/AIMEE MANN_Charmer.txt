When youâre a charmer
the apples fall
and youâre quite the little collector
you got âem all

When youâre a charmer
people respond
they canât see the hidden agenda
you got going on

But when youâre weak itâs the Holy Grail
youâre two for one, itâs a fire sale
and thatâs a wall that you cannot scale
so youâre forced to burrow under

When youâre a charmer
the world applauds
they donât know that secretly charmers
feel like theyâre frauds

When youâre a charmer
you hate yourself
a victim of sideshow hypnosis
like everyone else

and then your thinking goes black and white
and youâre all hunger and appetite
this is a battle you cannot fight
no, you only can surrender
no, you only can surrender
