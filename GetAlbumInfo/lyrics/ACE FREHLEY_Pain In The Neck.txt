I think you're cute, you're a pretty girl
That's why we're living in sin
You always ask where I'm going
Or find out where I've been

Have lots of fun, makin' love, girl
But now you're making me sad
No kisses or any sympathy
Can make up for the past

You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck

I'm sick and tired of all your questions
Stop telling me lies
You always go around snooping
Like a private eye

Don't want your love or your money
So put the toys away
Don't wanna hear you complaining
Because you're leaving today

You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck

You gotta go, gotta go now
But I must confess
I'm gonna miss that good lovin'
But you failed the test

You better think about your future
Take a reality check
You can't go around screaming
You just better accept

You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck
