If you had a day,
would you give me a moment?
Would you allow our play
to leave no bone unbroken?

Letâs love, like 17.
Iâm in love with poisoning.
Only bring your pretty, frightful gifts to me.
Letâs love, and kill like 17 now.

If I werenât so cold,
we could unfreeze this moment.
And as the world grow old,
Weâll leave no heart unbroken.

Letâs love, like 17.
Iâm in love with poisoning.
Only bring your pretty, frightful gifts to me.
Letâs love, and kill like 17 now.

Tomorrow cannot be like this.
And even though itâs such a simple world,
tomorrow cannot be like this.
Tomorrow they will take a stand.
Weâll leave no heart unbroken.

Letâs love, like 17.
Iâm in love, with poisoning.
Only bring your pretty, frightful gifts to me
Letâs love, and kill like 17 now.

Letâs love, like 17.
Iâm in love with your new screams.
Only bring those pretty, frightful things to me.
Letâs love, and kill like 17 now.

Letâs run, and kill like 17 now.

Letâs love, and kill like 17.
