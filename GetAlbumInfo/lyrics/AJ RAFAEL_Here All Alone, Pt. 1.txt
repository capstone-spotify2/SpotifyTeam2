There are times when I have a fit
And there are times when I lose it
But I am willing to change my way
Even if you don't say

Yeah I know I'm a jerk when I get mad
I misunderstood the problem that we had
And now I'm all alone in this cold dark world
Waiting for the truth to be told

Ohh don't leave me here all alone
And Ohh, oh can you just pick up your phone
And Ohh, oh the words that I didn't mean to say 
Ohh Ohh they came out anyway

Maybe one day you'll finally understand
How much I wanted this please understand

I didn't mean to make it end up like this
And now I'm sitting here still

Ohh don't leave me here all alone
And Ohh, ohh can you just pick up your phone
And Ohh, ohh the words that I didn't mean to say 
Ohh Ohh they came out anyway
And Ohh, ohh, I hate the way that I am
And ohh, ohh can you just say that you care
And Ohh, ohh I'm stuck in 99 problems
Ohh ohh, don't have to be this way

Don't have to be this way <i>[x2]</i>
