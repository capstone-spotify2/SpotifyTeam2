We need a think tank I'm thinking
We need a think tank I'm thinking

With tender smile, we bless a child
with love and light, and patron saint.
Don't let them cry, that we denied
tomorrow's child today.

The hurt, the need, to heal, to feed
They linger near the marketplace.
Will we deny, or compromise
tomorrow's child today?

La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-lay
Mama loves a mambo, Mama Papa sway
La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-lay
Mama Papa thinkin' 'bout tomorrow today

As rivers roar, the eagles soar
this ancient lore of rightful place.
Do we ignore, or save them for
Tomorrow's child today?

La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-lay
Mama loves a mambo, Mama Papa sway
La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-ay
Mama Papa thinkin' 'bout:

Tomorrow today---Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Tomorrow today---Is anybody thinkin' 'bout

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-lay
Mama loves mambo, Mama Papa sway
La la la la la la la ley lu, La la lee lew-lay
Celebrate and think about:

Tomorrow Today - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Tomorrow Today - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Thinkin' about the homeless - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Thinkin' about the joblessness - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Thinkin' about the children - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
Thinkin' about the forest, yes - Is anybody thinkin' 'bout
