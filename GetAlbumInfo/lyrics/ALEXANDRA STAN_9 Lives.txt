Ayo, I used to lay low
Never said I was bueno
People talking 'bout this, talking 'bout that
Mean you get labeled
I, I, I ride the cradle
Put your cards on the table
Got them looking like this, looking like that

Come for like pow, pow, pow
I'mma knock you right out, out, out
But you going down, down, down
Now, you better do it, baby
You better do it, baby

You know that I got nine lives
You know that I don't think twice
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how we feeling right now
You know that I got nine lives
Attitude and a roughneck style
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how you feeling right now

Ahora, I'm running sola
Don't care if you hold out
A little bit of this, little bit of that
You can call me mala
But like I'm a soprana
On the way to the conquista
That's how much I miss ya
Singing like this, ya

Like pow, pow, pow
I'mma knock you right out, out, out
But you going down, down, down
Now, you better do it, baby
You better do it, baby

You know that I got nine lives
You know that I don't think twice
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how we feeling right now
You know that I got nine lives
Attitude and a roughneck style
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how you feeling right now

<i>[Jahmmi:]</i>
Me no step back
No matter what you do
You could've never stop that
Me and my people ah step up
You know we top on top
So when you see me 'pon the street
<i>[?]</i>
We go hard, yo
Now no time for
Non-stop progress is where we <i>[?]</i>

You know that I got nine lives
You know that I don't think twice
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how we feeling right now
You know that I got nine lives
Attitude and a roughneck style
Don't stop, never ever back down
Tell these motherfuckers how you feeling right now
