Pro tools and a mic and a big idea <i>[x4]</i>

I've seen almost every side of the industry
Except the side we've been working seven years to see
Just some kids with pro tools and a mic and a big idea, but no IDs

So bar scenes weren't an option
Ukulele DJs
Only band in the genre
And we're dreaming of Bahamas
So pass around the bottle
Good music's still good even if no one is watching

Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want

Pro tools and a mic and a big idea <i>[x4]</i>

John's too big to fail
Make it superstar
His label's doing the thing and we were doing ours
Shame painted the discotheque
I was feeling kind of alone till I heard that track, oh
And now we celebrate
If only for today
No story's a fairytale
I don't know if we'll make it
But we're not too big to fail

Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want

And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown

Pro tools and a mic and a big idea <i>[x4]</i>

Oh, oohh
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you like
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Trying to stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle we made a star
You can do anything you want
You can do anything you want
