I watch my love she's sleeping
The air around her deepened
Tomorrow she will smile again
Tomorrow she'll get wild again

My love
And the moon
Take your time
Make it soon

I didn't mean to hurt you
It's what I use the words to
Every time we loose our way
Get so many things to say

My love
And the moon
Take your time
Make it soon

I see you and I hear you call
But sometimes when I lost it all
I go out of my mind
To see what I can find
I can find

I watch my love she's sleeping
The air around her deepened
Tomorrow she will smile again
Tomorrow she'll get wild again

My love
