Sittin' in the mornin' sun 
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come 
Watchin' the ships roll in 
Then I watch 'em roll away again 
Yea 

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the time roll away 
Oh 

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Wastin' time 
I left my home in Georgia 
Headed for the Frisco Bay 
Cause I had nothin' to live for 
And look Like nothin's gonna come my way 
So I'm just goin to sit on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the time roll away 

Ooh 
I'm sittin' on the dock the dock of the bay wastin' time 
Look pop nothin's goin' to change 
Everything still remains the same 
I can't do what ten people tell me to do 
So I guess I'll remain the same 
Yes 

Sittin' here restin' my bones 
And this loneliness won't leave me alone 
Yes 

2000 miles I roam 
Just to make this dock my home 
Now I'm jus' gon' sit at the dock of a bay 
Watchin' the time roll away 
Ooh 

Sittin' On the dock of the bay wastin' time
