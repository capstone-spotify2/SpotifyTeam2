They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck

1989 Cheyenne Chevrolet
5-Speed, single cab
Bench seat, faded grey
Turned over twice, ain't too nice
But it knows how to run
Girl, I'll get you out with a bang
Like a bullet from a gun

They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck

Summertime sunshine, cheap sunglasses
My heart sang southern twang
Sweeter than molasses, like the
Country angel two stepping in my dance of dreams
Girl, you got a heart of gold
And you're beautiful in blue jeans

They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck

They say life is like a highway
You can turn into a dead end road
I ain't afraid to get stuck
I got a 4-wheel drive kinda heart
I know is tough enough to carry any load

They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Good luck

They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me 
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
I wanna be your getaway truck
