Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright alright
Bring it in bring it in what? bring in the verse

Listen up 'cause there ain't nothing funny
I wanna hot girl and a lil bit of money
I wanna lil house where my band can live
'Cause were tired of moving every other weekend
I wanna go to a party where they got no guns
I wanna rock with my band I wanna have a lil fun
Where thugs and punks
And any other type
Can sing this song and we sing it all night, sing it

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright alright

All I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
All I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
And I don't wanna run for the president
I just want an honest way to pay my rent
And I'm tired of the man always shuttin us down
Tired of my old man 'cause he's never around
And I'm tired of eating off of other peoples plates
And I don't look important so their tellin me to wait
Police records said I wouldn't exist
I wanna know the meaning of a Christmas list
Said all I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
All I wanna do is make something from nothing
It's GC baby and were workin with something

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do it one more time
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright alright

We'll be self made millionaires
These lives we'll lead without a car
And we'll see
What we'll be
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody say ah yea that's right
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody sing it one more time

Everything will be alright alright
Everything will be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright alright

We'll see you there when we get there
We'll see you there when we get there
On the video
Or the radio
In the magazines
On the movie screens
