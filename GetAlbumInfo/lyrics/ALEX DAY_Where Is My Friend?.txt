You are the one who is throwin' a party
And bringin' our friends into town
I am the one who refuses to go
Because we aren't the same as we were when we started out

We used to be an unstoppable force
When the world was laid out at our feet
I should have said this before
I let things get so clouded
Now I can not find a way back
To when we were friends not foes

And I'm sorry
And I want you to know
That I want my buddy back
I want my pal
I never thought I'd feel this way
But I miss you right now
I miss the jokes we made
We laughed and we thought it would never end
Tell me where has my buddy gone?
Where is my friend?

I know that I was just tryina be helpful
When I took you out of that chat
I thought that I was just bothering you
And that it would be easier if you didn't see all that
Now we said some things
And I don't think we mean 'em
'Cause it seems we still get along
And you folded my clothes although you didn't need to
And I think that shows we got something worth holding on to
We're friends not foes

And I'm sorry
And I want you to know
That I want my buddy back
I want my pal
I never thought I'd feel this way
But I miss you somehow
I miss the jokes we made
We laughed and we thought it would never end
Tell me where has that buddy gone?
Where is my friend?

Tell me where has by buddy gone
Where mon amie?
