It's all a lie everything I've been told 
It's a phony lullaby that your blindly sold 
Like a dog gone mad in this raging heat 
Like a gambler been had 
And shunned to the streets with nothin' to eat 
The damage is done so let's drink it up 
We got nothing to lose it's up to you 

C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 

I can't pay my bills and I can't pay the new tax 
I got obsolete skills so they gave me the axe 
So I kiss the world goodbye cause the times have changed 
It ain't the same no the future is slain and I ain't to blame 
The damage is done so let's drink it up 
We got nothing to lose its up to you 

C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 

C'mon you gotta get up you gotta get out 
You gotta give it all that you can 
You gotta turn it up and play it loud 
Cause that's what livin' is all about 
Get busy 

I'm gonna ride every wave and break every chain in my way 
Gonna live till I die drink and get high every day 

C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
C'mon get busy livin' or get busy dyin' 
Get busy 
Are livin'? 
Get busy 
Get busy livin' yeah
