<i>[David:]</i>
I been sippingâ on the, I been sipping on the sand darling

<i>[Carter:]</i>
When I come around, I see the clouds are grey, 
the light, keeps me up high, floating away
If the sun shines, off my eyes, I fall to my feet, 
the skies, are a clear blue, my blind fold to grey

<i>[Carter:]</i>
Walking through the field, into, 
the textures on my hand are sliding, 
flowing, through, the sounds are growing yeah, 
Iâve been locked up for days, the nature and the sky, make me wanna breathe

<i>[David:]</i>
I been sippingâ on the, I been sipping on the sand darling

<i>[Carter:]</i>
Iâve been sipping on the sand darling, 
Iâve been writing with my hands all night
