I ain't got no time
There's too much that's on my mind
Whole team on my back
Told my family I'll be fine
Hypes been hypnotizing
Pray to God I don't go blind
Lights are mesmerizing
Don't get lost within the shine
Better keep your, your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your

Keep your talking in check
I walked my walk till I walked on the jet
Headed to Europe the come up was set
The team reign supreme
Work too hard not to flex
I make these hits
Then I'm onto the next
Tryna roll like them
Now I roll with the best
Down to cut ties
Unless you wanna cut checks
I ain't got enough time
To entertain your mess
Working, working, working
I deserve it, back in 2011 I was cutting verses
Saw me as an artist
They just saw the person
Now I blur the lines
Like I write in cursive
See the youngin's coming up
Wanna life like mine, last year, two jobs
I wrote rhymes all night
If you down to do the work
Like that you're fine
But you ain't really that
You ain't really 'bout it
Waiting on your come up
Ain't the way about it
No if ands about it, no excuses made
I came out the town, got no time of day
Now I'm on my way
These days I get paid
Never sacraficed who I am away
Navigated oceans for the poets
While they tryna ride the waves
I put in motion

I ain't got no time
There's too much that's on my mind
Whole team on my back
Told my family I'll be fine
Hypes been hypnotizing
Pray to God I don't go blind
Lights are mesmerizing
Don't get lost within the shine
Better keep your, your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your

What if Russ gave a nod to Swagy
What if Tesla called out Edison
What if it don't matter what I think
All that matter's what I represent
But I go and get mine
I put it all on the line
This is for all of the times
They never thought I would shine
Put on your shades, why
Without 'em you're blind
I got balance problems
I can't leave my work
Either working
Or I'm working on my work
My girl know I'm stressed
I could use a breath
But she know that
I work better when I'm pressed
Do the numbers
But I'm unimpressed
Never happy I need bigger steps
I need longer flights, I need zero rest
I need ones and zeros
Like the matrix's in my checks
Gauntlet on my neck
Thanos with the flex
Marvel at the level that the team has set
We ain't finished yet
Far from at the top
We ain't slowing down
Came too far to stop
Neverland views over 80mill, facts
Can't say shit to me know I'm good, flex
Still the same kid with a head full of dreams
Still woke but I'm doing what they never could, yeah

I ain't got no time
There's too much that's on my mind
Whole team on my back
Told my family I'll be fine
Hypes been hypnotizing
Pray to God I don't go blind
Lights are mesmerizing
Don't get lost within the shine
Better keep your, your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your shades on

Better keep your
Better keep your
Your blinders on

Better keep your
Better keep your
