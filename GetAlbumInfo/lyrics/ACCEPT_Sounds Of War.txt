Sounds of chains we hear from far behind
Mechanic noises of magic kind
Mighty war machines are on their way
I'm knowing here no place to stay

Time will come - we'll have to pay
An evil war will come some day
I feel frosty atmosphere
Don't you see that the point is near

Shooting guns I hear from everywhere loud
Bombs are falling out of dark grey clouds
Tanks are coming - beware of the chains
Children are suffering - They cry for help

But chains are coming and they smash them down
Bombs burn houses and everything around
No use of crying - it seems to be the end
It seems to be the end of this rotten land

I was born - oh, tell me why
I was born - oh, tell me why

Killing children - who doesn't know hatred
Torturing people - what for this mess
Tell me the sence of useless life
Killing each other with guns and knives

I was born - oh, tell me why
I was born - oh, tell me why

But chains are coming and they smash them down
Bombs burn houses and everything around
No use of crying - it seems to be the end
It seems to be the end of this rotten land

I was born - oh, tell me why
I was born - oh, tell me why
