I've said it all today, all I have to say
Meaningless words and clichÃ©d yesterdays
In my head again, I've said it better then,
No need to argue, no need to fret
Thought about the words I said, not the ones I meant

I've been dreaming of dreaming
About a stranger stuck in my skin
I've been living in secrets
Consumed, I don't want to make believe
I've been dreaming of you
I've seen in a dream within a dream
I cant believe
Until the choice is you vs. them 
I wont wake up

Save myself from grace, same as yesterday
No one to save you and no need to care
This voice inside my mind, narrates, expands in time
Strive to become the dead, reveal the life later
Tell me all is real in this worm tapped

I've been dreaming of dreaming
About a stranger stuck in my skin
Ive been living in secrets
Consumed, I don't want to make believe
I've been dreaming of you
I've seen in a dream within a dream
I cant believe
Until the choice is you vs. them; 
I wont wake up to

My entire life, a giant lie, time to stretch out

I've been dreaming of dreaming
About a stranger stuck in my skin
I've been living in secrets
Consumed, I don't want to make believe
I've been dreaming of you
I've seen in a dream within a dream
I cant believe
Until the choice is you vs. them

I'm in a dream within a dream
I'm in a dream within a dream
I'm in a dream within a dream
I'm in a dream and I wont wake up
