Two A.M. on a downtown street
There on a corner two strangers meet, in the night
And then until the daybreak
They're gonna love and before and light,
A heart may break, there in the night

Look in the alleys along the roads
It's there the losers stand,
There in the ring they bide their time
Hustling what they can
They beg just to get
That bottle in their hand

There in the night
Somewhere in the night
Oh how they do what they do
Just to get through
There in the night... in the night

Then on the street in the heart of town
A lady in black she turns around, in the night, yeah
She stares at the man in the Cadillac
He drives by but he'll be back... for the night
There in the night

See the guy along the road
Who can he be?
Wait awhile he'll turn around
See the man is me
'Cause when I sing my dream...
My dreams will set me free

There in the night
Somewhere in the night
Oh how they do what they do
Just to get through
There in the night... in the night

When the sun goes down
And the light grows dim
Slowly move in for the kill
If you would come back again
It would take away this pain
But I don't know if you ever will

Love in the night
Would feel so right
So love me tonight... in the night

There in the night
Somewhere in the night
Oh how they do what they do
Just to get through
There in the night... in the night
