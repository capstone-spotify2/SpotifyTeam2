Let me explain 
Cause it drives me insane. 
Just to know you are there 
Seems like you don't care 
Another ending the same. 

Fuck you and everyone and everything. 
Cause we all know whose king, 
When I'm still standing in the ring. 

It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, 
It's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away

In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see

I never knew this was a war. 
Lost count at you're a whore. 
Karma's fair but instead 
I'd rather see you dead. 

It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, 
It's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away

In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see

I would walk through fire just to be with you. 
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do. 

Run away.

In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see

We don't give a fuck we just came to party. 

I don't give a fuck I just came to party. 
Wish you would have stayed. 
Stay with me.
