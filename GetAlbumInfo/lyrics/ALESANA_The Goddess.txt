My breath is slowly catching up to my mind after the crash
Inhale, exhale
Now open your eyes, see the wonder
Iâm telling you its unbelievable

Did I lose myself? Am I still alive?
Something isnât right
Am I just asleep or is this really happening to me?
Tell myself Iâm fine
Get up on your feet, get up on your feet
Answer me now!

I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy
A seduction becoming a part of me
Damn you! Temptation, youâve got a hold on me
Stand up, walk away, donât fall into the trap

Illusion is best when you donât try to fight back
Give in to the pleasure, skin on skin
I will take you places youâve not been
Elation is nothing but a myth unless you give in

Did I lose myself? Am I still alive?
Something isnât right
Am I just asleep or is this really happening to me?
Tell myself Iâm fine
Get up on your feet, get up on your feet
Answer me now!

I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy
A seduction becoming a part of me
Damn you! Temptation, youâve got a hold on me
Stand up, walk away, donât fall into the trap

We choose the foolish of the world to astonish the wise
The weak to embarrass the strong
Nothing is impossible, we must hope for everything
You donât have to understand things for them to be
You just have to believe in the unbelievable...

My shadow hides in a place where the sun screams
Come back, my tears
Please just tell me what you are!
Why canât I feel?

I canât stay here I will never be anything but a fraud too scared to lose it all!
I wonât let you go

I donât wanna leave because you are ecstasy
I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy
A seduction becoming a part of me
Damn you! Temptation, youâve got a hold on me
Stand up, walk away, donât fall into the trap

I donât wanna leave because you are ecstasy
