Spent my nights in a sleeping bag smelling kerosene
thinking fog and sand
was gonna keep me clean
feeding all the bluejays at the wrong address
where they went instead
I could only guess

Tell the barfly
who runs this town
you wonât get high
youâll just get down
tell the barfly
itâs on his dime
you wonât get high
so do the time

Took a breath full of iodine and I overdosed
and the tide crept high
like a watery ghost
and no one needs your kind
of a dope sick clown
you can always find
sitting one seat down

Tell the barfly
who rolls the dice
your numbers up
so roll it twice
tell the barfly
itâs on his dime
you wonât get high
so do the time

Honey, Iâm not the one whoâs of use to you now
I get an hourâs sleep at night
and I canât see how
you deserve all the mess that even guilt wonât allow

Tell the barfly
who runs this town
you wonât get high
youâll just get down
tell the barfly
itâs on his dime
you wonât get high
so do the time
