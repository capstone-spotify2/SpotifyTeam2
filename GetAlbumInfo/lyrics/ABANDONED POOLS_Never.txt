Well we never made it through another day
And it's all because you had to have it your way

So lucky you
I wonderin' when I'll be OK
If it's never than it's never

Well your mind is there but your heart is out to lunch
And it's all because your philosophy's just a hunch

T.V. time's over
Father's order
