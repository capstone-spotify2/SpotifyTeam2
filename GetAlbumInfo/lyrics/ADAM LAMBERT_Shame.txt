See, by now I would have learnt just how you love to hurt me
Before I get a chance to speak you're convinced I'm guilty

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
You're galling me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so,
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy

Now, I don't mind a little pain when I've really earned it yeah
But you got me whipped and chained when I don't deserve it

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
You're galling me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so,
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy

A shame, a shame
It's a damn
Shame
A shame, a shame
It's a damn
Shame

Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me
Ashamed
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me
Ashamed

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so,
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy

I feel
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me
Ashamed
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me
Ashamed
