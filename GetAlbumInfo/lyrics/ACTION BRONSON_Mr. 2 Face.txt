<i>[Intro: Action Bronson]</i>
Yeah! Bam Bam
Live from Jamaica
Uh, yeah

<i>[Verse 1: Action Bronson]</i>
I'm feelin' like the Phantom of the Opera
Hangin' from the ladder with a chopper
I might splatter if I drop
They say I look Spanish in the drop
700 horses go "VROOM" then I vanish off the block
Now I'm in the store playin' lotto in a wife beater
One sock on, chancletas
Screamin', "You better give me my cheddar before I break shit"
Man let me stop, it's only good vibrations
How could I be mad at this view?
Strange patterns in the skies, snakes that fly
The mothafuckin' stakes are high
Look the other way when jakes roll by
For my birthday, put a hundred thousand in the cake, oh my
I think I might flip into the ocean
Press the pedal of the M3, yellow
Soundin' like explosions, baby girl, don't play with my emotions
Don't baby, don't baby

<i>[Hook: Jah Tiger]</i>
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Well done again

<i>[Verse 2: Jah Tiger]</i>
Mi as a ras mi haffi deh pon dem case
Know the tribulation, we all over your face
Dat's why mi nuh mingle inna no rat race
As a ras mi carry a permanent smile upon mi face

<i>[Hook: Jah Tiger]</i>
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Look Yah!

<i>[Verse 3: Jah Tiger]</i>
Meet you awhile ago and you have one face
Meet you did sour with a different face
Dat fi show say that you have two face
Your have a clean face and a... dirty face

<i>[Hook: Jah Tiger]</i>
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Well done again

<i>[Verse 4: Jah Tiger]</i>
Gwan like you ah work offa Satan face
Like you ah work offa Lucifer face
Like you ah work offa the devil, him face
Satan couldn't lend I man none o' him face

<i>[Hook: Jah Tiger]</i>
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Watch this!

<i>[Verse 5: Jah Tiger]</i>
Englishland people, from all different face
The people scatter, all over the place
You can hear it from the keyboard, the drum and the bass
As a ras mi nuh do my tings inna haste

<i>[Hook: Jah Tiger]</i>
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm Mr. 2 Face
Time you ah waste
I'm mistress 2 Face
Well done

<i>[Verse 6: Meyhem Lauren]</i>
White rum and ting, Magnum and tonic
Jamaican in Jamaica, gotdamn it's so ironic
Shots of JB at the 'dega party
Uh, can't walk, I can stagger hardly
Rasta tanktop, lookin' like it's '92
Mr. 2 Face, rasclot, we gon' find you
I'm livin' off the land like the Ital man
How to stay alive? That's a vital plan
Black sand beach, Boston Bay snapper
Curry on the lobster, jerk is comin' after
Take a shot of Jager, bone slide with a slide
Everything I read, there ain't no fuckin' with my vibe
June plum juice drippin' down my chest
Open off a bad girl, damn I'm such a mess
Flex with the top down, I'm doin' the pepper seed
Ask the dread who got the better weed

<i>[Bridge: Action Bronson + Meyhem Lauren]</i>
Freak dancin' in the basement, grindin' in the hallway
That's right, we do it all day
Freak dancin' in the basement, grindin' in the hallway
That's right, we do it all day

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Give me your love
Give me your love
