Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, save tonight
I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow w/our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging

Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm gon' find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't

Baby please don't run away
From my bed and start another day, stay instead
I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow w/our lips locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging

Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm gon' find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't

Well, I stay running from tomorrow
Well, I stay running from tomorrow
Well, I stay running from tomorrow
Well, I stay running from tomorrow

Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm gon' find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't
Baby please don't run away
