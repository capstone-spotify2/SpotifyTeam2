Put your hope down and be here
It's so clear what we came for
Don't close the door, come inside
And let the moment satisfy you, you
Cause we were born to come to life
Ooooowwww
Let's be reborn
Cause you ooo you ooo
Cause you're not alone
I sit right beside of you-oooooo
So stop wasting time baby

Celebrate for the morning
After a while we celebrate tonight
Celebrate for the morning
After so that now we'll never die
I'm gonna be right there with you
Right by your side, while I open up your mind
Celebrate for the morning
After a while we celebrate tonight
Yeah we're gonna celebrate tonight
Hey, ce-ce-ce-celebrate-celebrate-celebrate
Celebrate-celebrate-celebrate-celebrate...
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate...

After a while we celebrate tonight (oh celebrate)
Celebrate for the morning
After so that now we'll never die

Right by your side, while I open up your mind
Celebrate for the morning
After a while we celebrate tonight
Yeah we're gonna celebrate tonight
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
