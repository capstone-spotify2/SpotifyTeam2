If only you could see
If only you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
If only you could see
If only you could see...

Should I apologize to such pathetic eyes
Just the sight of you has made me sick tonight (tonight)
It was your poison kiss that turned me into this
Then again there is a chance you could be mine tonight

Darling will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear... (I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
(Are you satisfied?)

What fate has led me here... Oh please forgive me dear
I don't know if I could survive on my own (my own)
I could have married you instead I buried you
Now I will see if I can fall asleep alone (alone)

Darling will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear... (I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
The nightmares coming true
(Are you satisfied?)
It was all for you
(Are you satisfied?)
I did it all for you
(Are you satisfied?)

I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Darling will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear... (I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
The depths of a mans soul can not be measured in a manor of meters and fathoms; but rather, it is in my opinion, only quantified by his proximity to heaven and hell. It was in such a state I ushered myself
Passed the town tavern, bursting at the seams with the sounds laughter
And drunken piano playing. Had it only been a different night, a
Different place, a different kind of man passing by the threshold
Of that innocent pub, the events that transpired at that point
Would have undoubtedly been drastically different. I can only guess if
Anyone outside that place had a clue when those exclamations of mirth became the
Desperate screams of the helpless begging for their very lives
