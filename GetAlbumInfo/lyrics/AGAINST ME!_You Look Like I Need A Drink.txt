In the closest alley, 
in the first doorway,
he pushed up against her 
and closed his eyes. 
He said, "this is probably 
the worst decision that I've ever made."
She laughed and smiled. 
she said, "I'm sure you do this all the time...right, right, right, right, right?"

And the morning came, and the city woke
into the building, people all went to work, 
as their rides out of town came they parted ways 
she said, "do you know when you're coming back again?" 
Dig it deeper, deeper, and farther still, 
bury it up, over and into the ground, 
all these lies will grow in ways that we never thought possible.

Quiet down, down, down  
so soft of a sound, 
you can hear it all coming back after you. 
Quiet down, down, down  
so soft of a sound, 
you can hear it all coming back after you. 

Now you want to take it back, you think you might have fucked up. 
Waking dreams of concrete, deafening panic, cracked skull, 
there is yelling all around, get up, get up please start breathing 
and the moment will come when you finally realize 
the results of decisions and choices in your life,
can you hear it all coming back after you.

Down, down down
so soft of a sound, 
you can hear it all coming back after you. 
Quiet down, down down
so soft of a sound, 
you can hear it all coming back after you, you, you
