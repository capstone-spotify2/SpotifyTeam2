<i>[Dallas:]</i> Look around, look around.
There's no affection, only infection.
Search yourself, search yourself.
Can I depend on you to surrender?

<i>[George:]</i> And we will storm their shores,
Eyes suffocating all they see.
Feet sturdy on the rubble that will soon be dust.
And there will be no ruins, no memory, no history
Only our unrelenting march side by side,
We will comb the earth and sweep it clean, hearts and feet unified.
The hand of man is no match for our warless army.

Please tell me that this is the end of the world.
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods and leave nothing in our wake)
It's time that we erase history
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods)
Without a trace or a memory
(On my word, we will seize fate)
Please tell me that this is the end of the world.
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods and leave nothing in our wake)
It's time that we erase history
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods)
Without a trace or a memory
(Destiny choked in our wage)

<i>[George:]</i> Steadfast soldiers with hands of Gods
And the numbers to succeed.
We will persist until all that's left is a perfect sphere.
Never a break in the chain,
Never a folly of conviction,
And may the traitors' ashes seal the barren landscape.

We are the end! <i>[2x]</i>

Please tell me that this is the end of the world.

Please tell me that this is the end of the world.
