I've got strange ways
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
I'll be gone
'Ive got strange ways
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
I'll be back
Again I've got no one
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
I'll be gone
(I'm telling you someday I'll be gone)

God bless you for being
by my side when I fell through
You could hear me you've got
Internet gateways through my world
God bless you I'm feeliing all the
Force you're closing in

Take it easy
You dock at my side when
I'm on fire
I've got strange ways..
Sometimes, I lose it (I lose)
Don't know where I'm going (don't know)
But I do hope ypu follow
All the way

God bless you for being
by my side when I fell through
You could hear me you've got
Internet gateways through my world

You don't know it
You're turning all this stone into a heart
I can see you
As you fight the fire
When I burn
I've got (I'm telling you someday baby I'll be gone/back)
