You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
I'm about to change your point of view 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You're messing with man on a mission
And a heart with hard headed ambition 
My sites are set on you, there's nothing you can do
You're messing with man on a mission

Darling I declare how dare you to compare
When you ain't ever loved no one like me
Unlike the other boys you may have played like toys
I'm more than a yo-yo on a string

<i>[Chorus]</i>

You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
You'll be mine by the time I'm through

<i>[Chorus]</i>
