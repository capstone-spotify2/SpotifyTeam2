I heard an angel whisper 
So softly in my ear 
I couldn't hear the words but message came in loud and clear 
Who wrote the book of love 
Calling anyone who knows 
The things it makes you do are unexplainable 

What can I do 
What can I say 
Don't say it's too late 
Oh, no 

I believe, that you can take this broken heart 
And give it all the love you've got 
And take the pain away 
Then I'll be yours forever 
I believe, that even if we're far apart 
You'll always be there in my heart 
To brighten up my day 
'Cause we belong together I believe 

Well I don't know what happened 
It was just destiny 
But now I want you back 
Lyin' right here next to me 

Your body glistening 
With sweat from love so hot 
So are you listening 
To the things I talkin' 'bout 

What can I do 
What can i say 
Don't say it's too late 
Oh, no 

I believe, that you can take this broken heart 
And give it all the love you've got 
And take the pain away 
Then I'll be yours forever 
I believe, that even if we're far apart 
You'll always be there in my heart 
To brighten up my day 
'Cause we belong together I believe 

A change is gonna come 
If you just let me trough 
I think I'm in love with you 
I know I'm in love with you 

I believe, that you can take this broken heart 
And give it all the love you've got 
And take the pain away 
Then I'll be yours forever 
I believe, that even if we're far apart 
You'll always be there in my heart 
To brighten up my day 
'Cause we belong together I believe
