No there ain't nothin' like a summer on a Saturday night
Love is in the air and life is right
Put on your dancin' boots
Slip your red dress on
And I'll pour the wine and play your favorite song
I wanna swing you round the kitchen floor
And leave a trail of clothes all the way through the bedroom door
Turn out the porch light
I want to take you home tonight

I want to feel your heartbeat next to mine
I want to feel your desire
Then take you higher
Then those stars up in the moon light sky
We're gonna fly
We're gonna fly

I don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home
Don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home tonight

No there ain't nothin' like a Sunday mornin' sunrise
When you wake me with your sweet surprise

There's no kids around
It's been a while
Since I've seen that come an get me smile
No we don't have to go to Mexico
To find some getaway somewhere along the coast
Right here is just right
I'm gonna take you home tonight

I want to feel your heartbeat next to mine
I want to feel your desire
Then take you higher
Then those stars up in the moon light sky
We're gonna fly
We're gonna fly

I don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home
Don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home tonight

I want to feel your heartbeat next to mine
I want to feel your desire
Then take you higher
Then those stars up in the moon light sky
We're gonna fly
We're gonna fly

I don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home
Don't want to leave this house
I want to take you home tonight
Take you home tonight
Take you home tonight
