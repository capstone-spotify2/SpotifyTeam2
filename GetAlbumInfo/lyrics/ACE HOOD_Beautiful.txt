<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
I think I met her bout a year ago
College girl she was a Florida state seminal
Had a job at the mall working 10 to 4
Hella fine I ain't lyin' ya'll don't hear me though
So I'm walking right up to her hey my name Ace
She replied with a smile and said her name Shay
Ha-ha, very conservative I love that
Fitted jeans rocking jays and a snapback
Yeah, but I can see that you a killa girl
See you hot in that physique you betta get it girl
Uh and you the shit but she don't know it yet
Turning red got her blushin' where ya momma at
Uh, cause all I wanna do is thank her
I'm using beautiful and gorgeous in the same verse
Uh huh, I swear I'm tripping you just got me open
And hope that we can get acquainted, what I'm highly hopin'

<i>[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]</i>
Oh, Oh, Oh

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
Uh, and I just hope this got you motivated
That's cause ya body got me cultivated
Seeing your fine ass alone I just can't tolerate it
And all your friends say I'm a dog every conversation
Mad cause you smilin' more on a daily basis
Tell me why they hating everything's accommodated
I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient
True story had a thing before we started dating
Said she never heard beautiful so many times
Silly guys approaching with all the wrong lines
That's the reason for her being single a long time
And all the roses I sent you pleasure was all mine
Yeah, women are beautiful in many ways
Confidence the stain never let it wipe away
What's a man without a woman I'm just here to say
He-he, I'm just here to say

<i>[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]</i>
Oh, Oh, Oh
Beautiful girl (ahahah) no matter who you are
Whether a superstar, whether you're regular
You know I love ya, so this one's for you girl
This one's for you girl <i>[x4]</i>
