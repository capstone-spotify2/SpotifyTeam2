Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?

On the town, sequins evening gown
Climb those stairs to that ballroom in the air
Get to poppin'

Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?

If you dare, dream of yesteryear
In the air, do a step with Fred Astaire
Get your top hat

Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof

You can be what you want to be
Come waltz with me or a hot steppin' boogie
Funk in the pocket

Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof

No one stays in downtown these days
Country calls, got us one and all

Before we end, let me recommend
What to do, when your heart is light or blue
Get to steppin'

Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
