Great god of might, great god of wonders
giver of life, giver of grace
creator of everything before us
you had me in mind before the stars were in place

Your love surpasses all by far
We're praising You for all you are

The reason we're here and the reason we sing
is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king
we lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing
you are holy
The reason we're here and the reason we sing
is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king
we lift up our hands and we lift up our minds
and we pray that all we do would bring glory to you

father of love. father of mercy
what have I done that you would think about me?
you've taken my shame, you've taken my sorrow
replaced them with life and life abundantly

you can see inside my heart
you can see inside my mind
So strip away the things
that leave me deaf and blind
