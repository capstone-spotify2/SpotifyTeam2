<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The sun goes down the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

You've cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I've decided you look well on me, 
Well on me so let's go somewhere no one 
Can see, you and me

Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Black Prez:]</i>
I just wanna make it clear when I first met you
I gad to face my fears you was out my league
No bases near now I'm feeling so glad to see 
You hear thanks for coming though we 
Got out drinks got a couple more you brought 
Your girl got a couple bro's not more bright lights
Gotta love them low, low just you and me
Join my squad we can rule the team
They could not us in and loose the key
We can even just chill that's cool with me
But we going to party up for this reasons
Acting like kids again like it's recess
What she told me could have believe it
That's what she said

Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
