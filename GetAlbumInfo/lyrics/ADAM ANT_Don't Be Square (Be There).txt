Music for a future age
Don't be square, be there
All good clean fun, whatever that means
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
Get off your knees
And hear the insect prayer

The brain will suffer
So ride hard, ride clean
How reputations scare
And love goes to war, whatever that means
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
Get off your knees
And hear the insect prayer

Dirk wears white socks
Dirk wears white socks
Dirk wears white socks
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople

And go we like this
And go we like that
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
Antmusic for sexpeople now

You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will

Dirk wears white socks
Dirk wears white socks
Dirk wears white socks

You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will
The future will not stand still
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will
The future will not stand still
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
You may not like it now, but you will
You may not like it now, but you will
The future will not stand still
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
