Meet me at the turnaround
Stop your car and look around
There I will be waiting
Forget for once how everything

Fades
It fades away

Iâll never get over what we said
It lingers in my head
Iâll always remember what we knew
One hundred percent to be true

To be right
To be real
Set in stone
And cast in steel

We made a pact
Eye to eye
Cross your heart
And hope to die

Can you see the end of things?
Can you see it happening?
Feel the ashes on the wind
Donât you hate how everything

Falls
Just falls away

Iâll never get over what we said
It lingers in my head
Iâll always remember what we knew
One hundred percent to be true

To be right
To be real
Set in stone
And cast in steel

We made a pact
Eye to eye
Cross your heart
And hope to die

It lingers in my head
Iâll always remember what we knew
One hundred percent to be true

Set in stone
And cast in steel
To be right and
To be real
Set in stone
And cast in steel
