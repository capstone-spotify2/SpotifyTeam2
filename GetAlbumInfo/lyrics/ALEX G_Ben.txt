Blood and sweat in my eyes
Another unfair goodbye
We're at war with the world
But I'm here fighting the hurt
And I say

Its always killed me inside
To watch injustice survive
What a painful price
To die while saving a life
And I say

And I'll be calm in the chaos
And peace where the madness resides
And you'll be the home for the broken
They'll know when they look in your eyes

I'm so angry these days
I don't remember my face
It's like I'm numb to the noise
And all I need is a voice
Saying

And I'll be calm in the chaos
And peace where the madness resides
And you'll be the home for the broken
They'll know when they look in your eyes
Yeah, they'll know when they look in your eyes
And they'll know when they look in your eyes
