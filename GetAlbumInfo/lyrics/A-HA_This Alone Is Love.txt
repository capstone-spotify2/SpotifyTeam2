This alone is love
No small thing
This alone is love
That my love brings

And all of us
Who are travelling by trap-doors
Our souls are a myriad of wars
And I'm losing everyone

It will make my last breath pass out at dawn
It will make my body dissolve out in the blue
Oh baby, what can we do.
