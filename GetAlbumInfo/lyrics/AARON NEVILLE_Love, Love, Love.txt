You said he was just an old acquaintance that you knew a long time ago
I could tell when he held you in his arms, you seemed spellbound by his charms
No need to try, you can't deny, that look in your eyes spelled love, love, love, love
L o v e, l o v e, l o v e was all I saw, it was love, love, love, love
And I used to call you on the telephone
And I thought, I thought it very funny why you were never home
And I used to believe that I could trust you
But I find that you untrue

Lately, lately I find that I'm all by myself
Thinking you love me, when it's someone else
Hats off, hats off to you and your new lover
'Cause for me, 'cause for me there will be no other
Girl, to take your place, with tears on my face
Farewell to you, may God bless and keep you

Please dear lord keep her safe for me
Farewell, farewell my darlin', my darlin', my darlin
Whoa I need you, I need you, I need you
