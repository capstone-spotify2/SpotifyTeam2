all i want is to be mesmerized
and you know what does those things to me
hypnotized?  look deep into my eyes
look deep into my eyes and you will see

that i'm the one who walks the tightrope up above
the heads of many who would love to see me fall
but when i'm feeling right, the music never stops
i'm breaking bones, but i can feel
no pain at all - i know that

this is all i need - this is all that i desire
i'll tell you this - i'm coming right down to the wire again
this is all i need - and this is all i need to know
i'll be lost until the music takes control

it seems to me there must be more to life you know
than racing up and down these dead end streets
i've got to try - out here it's do or die
and i'll be leaving nothing incomplete

this is all i need - this is all that i desire
i'll tell you this - i'm coming right down to the wire again
this is all i need - and this is all i need to know
i'll never stop until the music takes control
