Pale light this morning 
Woke me 
Slow pain I feel 
Will not let me be 

So much work to do 
I don't know if I can 
Trying so hard, so hard, so hard 
But I'm just one man 

Five years old I climbed up on the wall 
My mother warned me but I took no heed 
Like all creatures great and small 
I took a fall and found out I could bleed 

These days I'm afraid of everything 
Suppose cause everything will die 
Thought it was to love what they will lose 
So much easier to lie 

Sometimes I fell like I'm drowning 
Actually it's more like most of the time 
But every now and then when I'm sleeping 
I still have a dream that I'm flying 

And I wake up crying
