I done been around quite a few pretty ladies
But I've never felt the way I feel with you
You make me wanna lay your body down and make babies
I always keep it real I gotta tell you the truth

I just can't let it go
I leave I'll be right back
No lie girl you got that 
Like a C-4 in combat, play with it and I might explode
Sexy you in that
A lil' thick girl I'm in that
The cost I will spend that
'Cause girl I got money to blow

Girl I took a little sip of you
You got that magic potion
And I'm loving everything you do
Baby girl you go, go, go, go, go, go, go
(Hello, hello, you know you go girl)
Baby girl you go

I've been thinking 'bout it all damn day
(I've been thinking 'bout you all damn day girl)
Just say the word then I'm on my way
I'm on my way right now

I be feeling like a feen
Something like an alcoholic
I drink a lot but don't need no chase
Girl you know, Girl you know, Girl you know

I leave I'll be right back
No lie girl you got that 
Like a C-4 in combat, play with it and I might explode
Sexy you in that
A lil' thick girl I'm in that
The cost I will spend that
'Cause girl I got money to blow

Girl I took a little sip of you
You got that magic potion
And I'm loving everything you do
Baby girl you go, go, go, go, go, go, go
(Hello, hello, you know you go girl)
Baby girl you go

I've been thinking 'bout it all damn day
(I've been thinking 'bout you all damn day girl)
