Going in disaster
For the mankind is in fight
Madness saw the world
And there's no love and there's no life

Free me now - free me now - free me now

Can't you hear the laughter
Of the devil in the night
Children must be soldiers
Have no fear and have to fight

Free me now - free me now - free me now
Free me now - free me now - free me now

Killing must be faster
Of the nation full of fear
Can't you see the widows
Without home when cheating tears

Free me now - free me now - free me now
Free me now - free me now - free me now
