Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
That somber day
Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen

What wouldn't I give to resume our last goodbye?
I can't describe it
We met by chance here in Central Park
But where I can't remember

Give me a moment
Give me peace at heart
I'm thinking back
And I'm so sorry
I didn't expect
Such a fast depart
Together again
I didn't worry

Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
That somber day
Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
Don't fade away

With you the colors had a brighter shade
The sky was bluer and I was smiling
Now I'm stuck in an eternal fall
But I do recall your flavors

Give me a moment
Give me peace at heart
I'm thinking back
And I'm so sorry
I didn't expect
Such a fast depart
Together again
I didn't worry

Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
That somber day
Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
Don't fade away

But where do you turn to
When your answers long gone
I turn to the sunrise
And that is because, because of you

Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen
That somber day

Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen (Doreen)
Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen (That somber day)
Doreen, Do-Do-Doreen (Doreen)

With you the colors had a brighter shade
The sky was bluer and I was smiling
Now I'm stuck in an eternal fall
But I do recall your flavors

Doreen (Doreen, Doreen)
