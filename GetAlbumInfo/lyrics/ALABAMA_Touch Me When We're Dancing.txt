Play us a song we can slow dance on.
We want to hold eachother.
Play us a groove so we hardly move.
Just let our hearts be together.
Oh baby, cause it feels so good
When we're close like this.
Whisper in my ear and let me steal the tears.

Come on and touch me when we're dancin
You know you've got that lovin touch
Oh oh touch me when we're dancin
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love

Tonights the night and it feels so right
What my heart's saying to me
You're the one and I've waited so long
So let your love flow thru me
Oh baby cause it feels so good we can be this close
You got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast

Come on and touch me when we're dancin
You know you've got that lovin touch
Oh oh touch me when we're dancin
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love.
