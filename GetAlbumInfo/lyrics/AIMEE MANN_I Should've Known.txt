I should thank you almost
No one could kill it off until you bled it
But I got rid of that ghost
Though certain habits still remain imbedded
With the shadow of a doubt
But, baby, it was you who fed it
And I don't know what else to say
But I think you get it

I should've known
It was coming down to this
I should've known
You would betray me but without the kiss
I should've known
The kind of set-up it is

And always isn't always
When it's not your photograph that I've been keeping
But you still live in those days
When I'd stay awake just to watch you sleeping
You delivered that blow
But it left a mark on me that you're not seeing
And I don't know what else you hear
But it's not me weeping

I should've known
It was coming down to this
I should've known
You would betray me but without the kiss
I should've known
The kind of set-up it is

I should've seen the cracks in the ceiling
And the mirror covered up with dust
But I was busy talking on the phone
I should've seen the obstacles but I said
This house was built for us
Hello, is anybody home?

I should've known
The minute that we hit the wall
I should've known
The writing was upon the stall
I should've known
'Cause Rome was starting to fall

And I should thank you, almost
