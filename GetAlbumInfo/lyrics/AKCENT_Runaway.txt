I always wanted you by my side
I felt you were my guide
The one who showed me what's right

I used to think that you were my light
And trusted in your smile
But now you have decide

Runaway, runaway, runaway
Searching everyday, try to find your way
Runaway, runaway, runaway
Wanna find you, oh baby wanna
Runaway, runaway, runaway
Everything is grey, miss you more each day
Runaway, runaway, runaway
I will find you, you'll never runaway

I always wanted you by my side
I felt you were my guide
The one who show me what's right

I used to think that you were my light
And trusted in your smile
But now you have decide

Runaway, runaway, runaway
Searching everyday, try to find your way
Runaway, runaway, runaway
Wanna find you, oh baby wanna
Runaway, runaway, runaway
Everything is grey, miss you more each day
Runaway, runaway, runaway
I will find you, you'll never runaway

I'm running now, I'm running away
Searching for, searching for your smile
Every hour I'm looking for you
I'm looking for away, I'm looking for you

Runaway, runaway, runaway
Searching everyday, try to find your way

Wanna find you, oh baby wanna

Oh baby, baby ... runawaaay
