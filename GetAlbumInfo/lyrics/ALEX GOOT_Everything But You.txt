I bet you're listening
even when you're with him
I feel you thinking of me
under the circumstance
if we could try again
and you could finally see

It's like a mystery
The way you get to me
and I can't figure it out
when I contemplate all the things I need
know there's one thing I'm still without

I've got my life;
I've got the time to fill it
I've got my mind
racing like a bullet
I've got it all, 
everything but you

Got this guitar;
I strum along into it
We've got tonight;
let's turn it into music
I've got it all, 
everything but you
everything but you

Your mind is broken down
It's all I think about
feels like I'm living a lie
You've got me sinking here
no I'm not thinking clear
Girl, won't you give me a try

You're like a drug to me
and there's no remedy
except for hitting the ground
when I contemplate all the things I need
know there's one thing I'm still without

I've got my life;
I've got the time to fill it
I've got my mind
racing like a bullet
I've got it all, 
everything but you

Got this guitar;
I strum along into it
We've got tonight;
let's turn it into music
I've got it all, 
everything but you
everything but

Won't say it's love but I
can't get enough and I
I don't care anymore
I feel the rush and the
the loss of blood 'cause you're
dragging my heart on the floor

I've got my life;
I've got the time to fill it
I've got my mind
racing like a bullet
I've got it all, 
everything but... (you)

I've got my life;
I've got the time to fill it
I've got my mind
racing like a bullet
I've got it all, 
everything but you

Got this guitar;
I strum along into it
We've got tonight;
let's turn it into music
I've got it all, 
everything but you
everything but you
