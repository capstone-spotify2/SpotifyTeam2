Well I've been shattered and broken, for most of my life
But I've done pretty good, with a job and a wife
Got a family that loves me, and a good piece of land
That I bought with hard work, that I earned with these hands

These things that I do
I did them for you

So just tell me you love me, and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house, while I go away
And just promise to be here, when I get back home
So we can start where we left off, all those years ago

Before my demons... they took control
Lost and lonely, out here on the road

Cause I've been careless and selfish, got no self respect
I'm an albatross hanging around my own neck
I'm a hard one to handle, and I've played the fool
And I'm so hard to love, cause I break all the rules

These things that I do
Cause I couldn't have you

So just tell me you love me, and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house, while I go away
And just promise to be here, when I get back home
So we can start where we left off, all those years ago

Before my demons... they took control
Lost and lonely, out here on the road

So just tell me you love me, and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house, while I go away
And just promise to be here, when I get back home
So we can start where we left off, all those years ago

Before my demons... they took control
Lost and lonely, out here on the road

Lost and lonely, out here on the road
