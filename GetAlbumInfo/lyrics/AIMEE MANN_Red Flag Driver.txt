Red flag diver
jump to me
red flag diver
jump to me
Iâm just floating here
in a big red sea
red flag diver, dive in

Red flag diver
swim to me
Red flag diver
swim to me
youâll be miserable
but Iâll be free
red flag diver, dive in

cause first Iâll want it
and then I wonât want it
and then Iâll just scuttle it all
on rocks where sirens call
You can blame my daddy
the playboy caddy
who never kept his eye on the ball
the whitecaps rise and fall

Red flag diver
dive for me
red flag diver
dive for me
Iâm as good for you
as I can be
red flag diver, dive in

cause first Iâll want it
and then I wonât want it
and then Iâll just scuttle it all
on rocks where sirens call
You can blame my daddy
the playboy caddy
who never kept his eye on the ball
the whitecaps rise and fall
the whitecaps rise and fall
