Hurry home
Freight train running
I've been gone
Too long, honey
Why did I waste away
The only good thing left to save me

Hurry home
Freight train running
She's alone
Got no money
(She's alone...she got no money
Coming home, I've done my running)
Coming home
No more running
Why now should I deny
The only true thing left inside me 
Coming home
No more running 

I'm doing right
For once in my life now
I'm doing right
For once in my life now
No more running...
(He's doing right!)

(Rolling countries... fields unfolding
I swear the winds are calling)

So I hurry home
No more running
She's all alone
She got no money
(She's alone...she got no money
coming home, I've done my running)
Why should I go and hide
The only true thing left inside me
Hurry home
Freight train running
