On and on like a Rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah the right one
There will come a day when Ill bury you
I will go the same way, together,
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through

And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naive and semi-functioning
Hey this is a love song, hands up if you feel it.

And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
And the moment that's between us is everything
Don't say a word, that's not enough
