I hate your dumb tattoo
I wish you'd fly to the moon
Where there are no girls to use or screw over
I'm laughing 'cause I lied, you know
I said you sound like All Time Low
You really don't even though you try hard
You try hard

I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
Ohhh
And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
And all that I wanna say is
You really suck

I hate the scar above your eye
It looks like you're on drugs
And you really need to learn to wash your hair
Overall, you're not a catch
You're just a dumbass
Bleaching your hair
Well, I hope it all falls out
And it falls out

I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
Ohhh
And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
And all that I wanna say is
You really suck

Oh, and thanks for telling all your lies
'Cause now I realize
I'd rather date a rock
Oh, and thanks for the tickets to your show
I just wanted you to know
All your band mates are hotter than you

I bet you're gonna hear this song and say
"Oh my god she's so obsessed with me dude"
But no

And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
But no
And I bet you didn't know I talked to all the girls
That you were with when you were with me
And they said
You really suck
