Did you know, that I'm content just watching you talk on the phone?
Something as simple as hearing your tone
It's enough for me to feel like I'm at home (oh yeah)
Did you know? That each and every time you walk into a room
My eyes are totally fixed on you
I know you wanna to show me all that you can do
But I think that you're confused

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I don't ask for much
But I don't need anything
Baby all that I ask
My only request
All that I really need
Is to share the same air that you breathe

Sometimes I just stay awake and watch you sleep
And try to guess what you do in your dreams
That's my favorite thing to do when you're with me (oh yeah)
Did you know, that your smile lightens up through the night?
I like to think that happens when I'm on your mind
I know you wanna to give the world to me tonight
But you should realize

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I don't ask for much
And I don't need anything
Baby all that I ask
My only request
All that I really need
Is to share the same air that you breathe

And I'll be okay, as long as you're here with me yeah
Baby promise me that, there's no turning back
I'll be fine honestly, if I can share the same air that you breathe
So you don't have to prove, that your love is true
Might give you the world tonight, cause I'll be satisfied
If I'm by your side, I get a fillin' need from looking in your eyes

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I don't ask for much
And I don't need anything
Baby all that I ask
My only request
All that I really need
Is to share the same air that you breathe

And I'll be okay, as long as you're here with me yeah
Just promise me that, there's no turning back
I'll be fine honestly, if I can share the same air that you breathe

Ohh... Yeah...
Ohhh... Ohhhh. Ooohhh...
If I can share the same air that you breathe
