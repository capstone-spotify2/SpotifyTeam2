I sat down at a park bench watching my children play
When this old timer took a seat he said hello how's your day
Said to tell you the truth I shouldn't be here doing this
Between the headlines and deadlines I've got no time to reminisce

That's when he said sounds like you're a busy man son that ain't front page news
He said once upon a time I was wearing your brand of boots so listen up

I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby's crawls then they walk before you know it
There driven away
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
It goes zero to sixty in the blink of the eye

He took a picture from his wallet that he carried threw out the war
Of the beautiful brunet he married in 1944
My angel flew way it's almost been five years
And he told me her name then he wiped away his tear
Then he said take a look at your little girl
Enjoy that little girl smile
Because on day your gonna turn around you'll be walking her down the isle

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>

So count your many blessing and love with all your heart and hold on tight
You better cherish every morning and hit your knees every night
So I said lord I've gone the wrong way I've learned the hard way
We live we die the years fly by like white lines on the high way
Slow me down and make me see
The kind of man I need to be
Zero to sixty lives goes zero to sixty the old man said
I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby crawls then they walk before you know it
There driven away
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
It goes zero to sixty in the blink of the eye... in the blink of the eye
