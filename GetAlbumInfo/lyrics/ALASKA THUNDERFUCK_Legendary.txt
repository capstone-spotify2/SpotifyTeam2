I was flying on an airplane
And that airplane almost went down (down, down)
All the people started screaming
But I smiled as I looked around
Lady Death was staring at me
And I'll tell you what I found
It would be totally cool with me
If we crashed into the ground

I thought that's alright, that's okay
I'd be a legend if I died today
And I'd never get old, everybody would know that I was

Don't go and get it twisted
Cause I'm happy to be living my life
But don't you know what a lovely way to go
If I died on this dancefloor tonight

I thought that's alright, that's okay
I'd be a legend if I died today
And I'd never get old, everybody would know that I was

That's okay, that's alright
I'd be a legend if I died tonight
You'd remember me, young and pretty
That's the only way I'd want it to be

I thought that's alright, that's okay
I'd be a legend if I died today
And I'd never get old, everybody would know that I was
