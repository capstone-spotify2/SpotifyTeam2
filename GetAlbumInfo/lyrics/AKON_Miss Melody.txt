I'm ridin' full speed, leavin' from the ghetto doin'
A hundred miles an hour, you can barely see me movin'
Gotta shorty waitin' for me that I been pursuin'
And I ain't got far to go

She a bad chick, somethin' I ain't tryna ruin
She's steady callin', so I know she ready to get to it
I'm tryna get there but I just can't
Seem to catch up to her

By the time I got there she was gone
And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound
So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around
So I locked myself inside and closed the door
But there was this funny feeling inside
That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it

Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall

Standin' in front of my window pane
The sound got me starin' at the rain
The more she play the more I feel the pain
Why is she doing this, what's it to gain?

Seems like she tryna take my soul away
Startin' to feel I'm under her control today
I can't see her but I hear her from the shades
And it seems like she really knows me

Every fiddle makes me wanna run away
I can't take it no more, gotta get away
Got me talkin' about the dark nights
In the cage while she starin' at me

Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall
