I just kept hoping, I just kept hoping
The way would become clear
I spent all this time tryna play nice and
Fight my way here

See, I've been having me a real hard time
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

So I just kept dreaming, yeah, I just kept dreaming
It wasn't very hard
I spent all this time tryna figure out why
Nobody's on my side

See, I've been having me a real good time
And it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

So please don't take my feelings
I have found at last
So please don't take my feelings
I have found at last
Yeah, if I wanted to... I'd be alright

So I just kept going, I just kept going
And hoping I'm growing near
Well this good and fine, I spent all this time
Tryna find my way here

And I've been having me a real fun time
And it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

Please don't take this feeling
I have found at last
Please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
If I wanted to, I'd be alright
Yeah, if I wanted to, I'd be alright
