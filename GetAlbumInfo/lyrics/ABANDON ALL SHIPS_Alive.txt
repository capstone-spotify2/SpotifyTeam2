With the sun in my face and my head held high
I put my hands in the air to try and touch the sky
Take a deep breath and close my eyes
I spread my wings and I learn how to fly
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive

I put my hands in the air to try and touch the sky
Take a deep breath and close my eyes
I spread my wings and I learn how to fly
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
