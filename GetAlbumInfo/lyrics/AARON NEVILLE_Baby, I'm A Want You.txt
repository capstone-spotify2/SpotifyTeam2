Baby, I'm a want you
Baby, I'm a need you
You're the only one
I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm a crazy
But I just can't live without
Your love and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guidin' light
To help me through my darkest hour
Lately I'm a prayin'
That you'll always be a stayin'
Beside me
Used to be that life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why
Maybe I'm a crazy
But I just can't live without you
Baby, I'm a want you
Baby, I'm a need you
You're the only one
I care enough to hurt about
Lately I'm a prayin'
That you'll always be a stayin'
Beside me
Used to be that life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why
Baby, ooh, baby
I'm a want you
Baby, I'm a need you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
