Mary cries out: "for the love of God"
As she's walking out of the laundromat
Down the street and it's the short way home
Feeling special cause she's so alone

But we know:
(The world's full of lonely people)
And it shows
(The world's full of lonely people)

She shrugs her coat off and unlocks the door
Eats her dinner on the kitchen floor
Writes a poem and turns the radio on
Every singer sings the same old song

And it goes:
(The world's full of lonely people)
And it shows
(The world's full of lonely people)

But when we she wanted me to go
She just had to let it show
To bring me down if she wanted me to leave
She just wore it on her sleeve
But at least, I was around

But when we she wanted me to go
She just had to let it show
To bring me down if she wanted me to leave
She just wore it on her sleeve
At least, I was around

Mary Ellen makes the moment count
As she's looking through old photographs
Pictures taken from an early age
Faces look back at her from the page
And they say

(The world's full of lonely people)
It's ok
(The world's full of lonely people)
It's ok
(The world's full of lonely people)

But when we she wanted me to go
She just had to let it show
To bring me down if she wanted me to leave
She just wore it on her sleeve
But at least, I was around
I was around
I was around
I was around

Mary Ellen makes the moment count
