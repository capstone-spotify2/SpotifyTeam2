I gotta find a way to get outta here <i>[x2]</i>
This ainât the way that I wanna live, no
This ainât the way somethinâ gotta give
In a rush, rush (gotta keep on movinâ)
Iâm in a rush, rush (gotta keep on movinâ) <i>[x3]</i>

Cause I find myself on the fast track side to life, drivinâ me crazy
In the hood daylight to night and you can find me grindinâ daily
And it ainât gonâ change as long as we getting money keep the same mind frame
Same hood, betta pop that thang, same big whip on the block same fly dame
Wit my lady just rollinâ, with the sunshine and the wind blowinâ
Gotta keep my mind cleared from all this crime hopefully one day learn from it, but

Girl, itâs like I canât see the sun, six in the morninâ Iâm still on the run
Day to the night rushinâ around town tryinâ to get this done for the case come down
Gotta feed my fate, face to face with no place to race except straight
I can feel them close on my heels, gotta keep goinâ so Iâm takinâ the wheel
Tryinâ to outrun my fears, outrun my peers, outrun the killers and escape them years
Yet again, so I take out my pen and say âIf you find this letter please pray for meâ

Now can you picture me growinâ up on the bad side of town
Where them outlaws are hanginâ out all the women get down
Where cash moneys the only answer to problems around
And if ya missinâ your people most likely they underground
This cruel world, this cruel world
Leave this town forever, break away and just start err
