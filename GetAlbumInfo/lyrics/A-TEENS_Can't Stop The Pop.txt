Everybody's looking for a place to go 
Sick of watching all these silly TV-shows 
'N Mama don't like you crankin' up the stereo 
So I say it's only right that we should let 'em know. 
Oh yeah 

Can't stop the Pop - 'N you can't knock the feelin' 
We ain't never givin' up on what we believe in 
Can't stop the Pop â but we can show you the meaning 
'Cause it's about time you get some groovalistical healing 
Oh yeah, Can't stop the Pop 

Papa says you better make it home by ten 
But then at 10:15 you're sneaking out again 
And there's a party at the club but they won't let us in 
But I know dancin' in the street is perfect medicine 
Oh yeah 

Can't stop the Pop - 'N you can't knock the feelin' 
We ain't never givin' up on what we believe in 
Can't stop the Pop â but we can show you the meaning 
'Cause it's about time you get some groovalistical healing 
Oh yeah, Can't stop the Pop 

Can't stop â can't stop the Pop 
(They) said we can't rock â but we're keepin' it hot 
(So) let the beat drop â when we hit your block 
Said you can't stop â so come on, so come on 
On the rooftop â in the parking lot 
Put your hands up â they can like it or not 
It's a sure shot â give it all we got 
'Cuz we don't stop â won't stop
