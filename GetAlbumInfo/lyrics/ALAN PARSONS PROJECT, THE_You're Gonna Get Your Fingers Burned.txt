Watch me closely catch my eye
If you do I beg you to remind me
Who is stronger who is weak of those who seek
And don't know where to find me

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Ask me why, I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Now you see me now you don't
I thought by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned

Watch me closely understand
That what you see is only an illusion
If I'm wrong and you are right
Then I will light your darkness with confusion

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Ask me why, I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Chances are you're playing with fire
I thought by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned

Watch me closely be aware
That all I do is only to surprise you
Every move is slight of hand
And every word is planned to mystify you

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Ask me why, I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Don't get fooled a second time
I thought by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned
