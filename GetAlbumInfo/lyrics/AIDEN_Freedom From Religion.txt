Hey father curse this man,
Reverse his view,
Indoctrinate his children,
Instill the guilt so deep.
The promise of shame
And heavenâs a lie.

We need freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
Weâre better off without.

Hey preacher business man,
You fill your life
With dollar signs and trust.
The congregation weeps
You sell them lies,
Iâll tell you what we need.

Freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
Weâre better off without.
Freedom from religion now.
Oppression hate and thought crime.
We need freedom from religion now,
Weâre better off without a faith.
