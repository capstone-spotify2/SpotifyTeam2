There's an angel on the corner 
And they say she's watching over 
Over when we are under 
Fall asleep on the ground 

<i>[Pre chorus:]</i>
Hey 
Can you feel it calling your name 
Like a storm on a bone in the rain 
The pain now going you're not around 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense 

I gotta rock another city 
I gotta break another country 
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50 
Or i'm deep in the ground 

<i>[Pre chorus:]</i>
Hey 
Not another bone for the pain 
I'm never drinking again 
It don't make sense when you're not around 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense 

<i>[Solo]</i>

There's a devil on the road <i>[x3]</i>

<i>[Pre chorus:]</i>
I can feel it call your name 
The feeling that's keeping me sane 
Wide awake when you're not around 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense
