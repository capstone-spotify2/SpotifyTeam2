You never look up
You never look back 
You never say anything based on fact 
You've got issues going way back 
You never say 'hi' 
You never say much 
You never make an effort to stay in touch 
I've got this feeling something happened here 
Something happened here

Did anybody feel you? 
Did anybody deal you? 
Did anybody make you do some things now? 
Did anyone approach you?
Did anybody coach you?
Did anybody tell you what to say now? 
Hopeless - it's not hopeless 
Doubtful - but not hopeless at all 

You never looked up 
You never look back 
You never did anything in between
Are things black and white with you 
You never believed 
You never belonged 
Never made milestones to call your own 
I've got this feeling something happened here 
Something happened here

Did anybody hide you? 
Did anybody fight you? 
Did anyone decide to do some harm now?
Did anybody read you? 
Did anybody bleed you? 
Did anybody feed you lots of junk now?
Hopeless - it's not hopeless 
Doubtful - but not hopeless 
Hopeless - it's not hopeless 
Doubtful - but not hopeless at all 
Hopeless - it's not hopeless 
Doubtful - but not hopeless at all
