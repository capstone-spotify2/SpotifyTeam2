Ananize (Ananize)
Oh ananize (Oh ananize)
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Spoke to the wind and wind stopped still
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Ananize (Ananize)
Oh ananize (Oh ananize)
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Spoke to the sea and the sea got calm
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Ananize (Ananize)
Oh ananize (Oh ananize)
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Spoke to the sick and the sick got well
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Ananize (Ananize)
Oh ananize (Oh ananize)
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is

Spoke to the dead and the dead did rise
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is
