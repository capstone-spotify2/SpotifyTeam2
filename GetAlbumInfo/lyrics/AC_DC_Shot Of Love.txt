Come on honey take a trip with me
We'll take a double shot of ecstasy
An' drink some water from a wooden cup
Then keep on rockin' 'til the sun comes up.
And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love, shot of love

Rock you little lady make you blow and bleed
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Come on now honey we'll get full of desire
A humpin' an' a pumpin' 'til we start a fire
And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love

And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
And I warn you it's the best shot of your life
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love

Make you bleed
Shot of love, shot of love ,shot of love
A humpin' an' a pumpin'
I gotta get me shot of love
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love
Babe babe babe, a lot of what you need is guaranteed
Shot of love, shot of love, shot of love

Come on give me shot of love
