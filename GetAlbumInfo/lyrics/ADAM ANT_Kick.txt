I was walking down the street
I saw a man with one arm
I was walking down the same street, same street
I saw a man with one arm
One day, two men, one arm......KICK!
I was sitting on the underground
I saw a young lady sigh
I was sitting on the same train, same train
I saw a check lady cry
One day, two men, one arm......KICK!
