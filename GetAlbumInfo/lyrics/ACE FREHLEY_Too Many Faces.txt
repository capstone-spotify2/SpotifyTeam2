Too many faces in my head
I see the faces looking back at me
So many faces inside my head
They're in the mirror, I wish they'd let me be
Why are they looking at me?

Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me
Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me 

Too many faces in the mirror
They're always looking, looking back at me
I see the faces every day
I can't decide which one's really me
Or someone else I see 

Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me
Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me

I can't stop all of the faces
They're always looking, looking back at me
I wish I knew who was me

Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me
Too many faces in the mirror
Looking back, back at me
