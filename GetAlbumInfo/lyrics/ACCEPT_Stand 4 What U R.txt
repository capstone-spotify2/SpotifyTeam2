Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own

Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're living for
Open up the door no time for looking back
You're on your own

You say that time's been passing by
Feeling there is nothing concrete
Living for the moment
Blinded by your dreams

All you're saying you can't hold on
It's getting harder every day
You can't change who you are
Something you gotta face

You fell for promises
No one really ever made
Invisible pictures come true

Going through changes
Hoping that they never fade
Hold on don't reach for the stars

Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own

Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're living for
Open up the door no time for looking back
You're on your own - on your own

Can't stop time's been passing by
It's like living on a one way street
Stop trying to escape from the real world
And hanging by your string

Still you're saying you can't hold on
It's getting harder every day
You should know what you are
You better find your own place

Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own

Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're living for
Open up the door no time for looking back
You're on your own - on your own

You gotta stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own

You gotta stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
You gotta face it - make it on your own
You gotta face it - make it on your own

Stand for what you are
