An old man is proud, 
But behind his modest smile lies the grief 
Only one picture of his brave son remains

It seems that the vicious circle can never be broken through

The hopeful ones gathered their strength to achieve the apparent impossible 
But all plans seem to be in vain

As a soldier of Allah he's an example 
For the others on his bloody way to immortality

It seems that the vicious circle can never be broken through 
Because old wounds are reopened every time

This Intifada as a device to thwart the peace negotiations

He can rely on a reward in the hereafter 
Eternal paradise awaits him

"The peace that was born today, gives us
All the hope that the children born today
Will never know war between us,
And their mothers will know no sorrow.

Allow me to end by the simple words:
Shalom, Salaam, Peace."

Pugnacity
With our blood
Show no mercy
With our soul
Die for heaven
An eye for an eye
Burn to let them...
Suffer for all their actions

We will not move an inch 
They won't play in our hands
We will not tolerate those who defy

We will not hesitate
To start an attack if, 
You undermine the agreement

Let them suffer
Stop to let them suffer!
