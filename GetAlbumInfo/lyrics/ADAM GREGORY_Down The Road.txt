i see your tears
i hear your words
girl, i feel how much this hurts
i know you can't, see it now,
but i promise you, somehow

its gonna be beautiful
its gonna be easy
its gonna be magic
its gonna be healing
there's a place you're meant to be,
but its somewhere
down the road from me

i ask god, "what do i do?"
"whats the best way i can love you?"
he said, "son, you gotta set her free,
cuz i have a way,
that she has just gotta see."

its gonna be beautiful
its gonna be easy
its gonna be magic
its gonna be healing
there is a place you're meant to be
but its somewhere
down the road from me

it might be a thousand tears away
but baby i believe that there comes a day
its gonna be beautiful
its gonna be easy
its gonna be magic
its gonna be healing
there is a place you're meant to be
but its somewhere down the road from me
but its somewhere down the road from me
