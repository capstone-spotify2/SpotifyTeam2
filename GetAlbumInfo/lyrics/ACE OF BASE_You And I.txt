Oh yeah yeah...
You make me come alive

Att palla paron...

'Cause my eyes can see the why
You make me come alive
Someone maybe try to lay hurt on you
I will hunt them down and blow them away
And the city prays at our feet tonight

You and I were only animals
Live and die like burning candles yeah
You and I diggin' a dirty groove
'Cause we've got none to prove
And nothing left to lose
You and I we're like a perfect team
You and I live in an orange dream
You and I we're up against the wall
We got to beat them all
To be invincible...yeah

Will I ever be on my own again
Baby you got eyes that shine in the dark
Let the beat go on in the world tonight

You and I...

Att palla paron, ooh yeah yeah...
'Cause my eyes can see the why

Groove cause we've got none to prove

You and I don't care what people say
You and I are living day to day
Never die our love's immortalized
I'm hypersensitized
You make me come alive

You and I...
