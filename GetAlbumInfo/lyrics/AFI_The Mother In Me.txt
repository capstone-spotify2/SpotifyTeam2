Caught in a world that's plagued by something they call love.
A paradigm of illness
is the beast I have become.
The sights that I have seen could nearly bring me to my knees.
I've seen exactlty what it is I never want to be, 
But I keep it deep inside myself.
It's within me.
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me.
Last night I had the misfortune to see it all first hand.
"Evacuate the premises" was the innate first command.
What drives the need for all of this?
And will I ever understand?
Has someone failed to tell me of this master plan?
But I keep it deep inside myself.
It's within me.
Keep it deep within yourself and sink with me.
