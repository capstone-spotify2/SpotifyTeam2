Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
Hello hello
Coming from my work
I'm tired
I see you get on my bus
Here I go again
A new attraction
And I think I know you
Something is familiar about your face
I move through the crowd
So I can get a better look

Hello hello
I've got what you're searching for
Hello hello
Can't you see me
Hello hello
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart
Can't you see me, I'm here
Beside you

Weren't you the one that spilled
My long drink over at a bar 
Easy come, easy go
I said and laughed
Looking like a question mark you stood
There wondering what to do
Then I said to you
Don't you look too happy now

Hello hello
I've got what you're searching for
Hello hello
Can't you see me
Hello hello
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart
Can't you see me happy

Hello hello
Hello hello
Here I'm standing next to you
(Hello hello)
I'm a object nothing new
(Hello hello)
Talk to me you're looking strange
Let me know if my presence is bothering you

Hello hello
Everybody's looking
Oh can't you see me
Hello hello
Everybody's searching
Oh can't you see me

Hello hello
Everybody's looking
(A crazy heart, a heart)
(Oh can't you see me)
Hello Hello
Everybody's searching
Oh can't you see me
