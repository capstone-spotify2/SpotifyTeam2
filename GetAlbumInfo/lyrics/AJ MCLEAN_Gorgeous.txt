Hey, you're beautiful and I don't mind
You know I wanted you for such a long time
Don't think I don't notice your wondering eyes
Keep the options open for a sexier guy

You're in love with yourself, don't want anyone else
To be caught with you in the spotlight
Girl I know I'm the best I can beat all the rest

But you can't see that
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
Sexier than anything,
Gorgeous,
So much more that I can be
You can't see it
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
I love myself more than I love you

Baby I know it's hard to understand
That I'm the sexiest the freakiest man
Don't think I don't notice when you open your thighs
That they were made for a sexy guy

You're in love with yourself, don't want anyone else
To be caught with you in the spotlight
And I know I'm the best I can beat all the rest

But you can't see that
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
Sexier than anything,
Gorgeous,
So much more that I can be
You can't see it
Don't you know I'm gorgeous

I love myself more than I love you
Unlike no other I'll do you right
Unlike your mother your pussy is tight

I'm gorgeous
Sexier than anything,
Gorgeous,
So much more that I can bring
You can't see it
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
I love myself more than I love you
Love myself love myself more than I love you 

I'm so Gorgeous
