When you take a breath
But you can't hold it in
When you try to live
But don't know where to begin

When there's no hope left
No place you can go
Well, just look inside your heart
Close your eyes and you'll know

It's euphoria
Out of the blue, into the light
Let it shine down all over you, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
Under the moon, take in the night
Let each day start yourself anew, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

Like a piece of glass
That's washed in from the sea
You can't taste the good
Unless you're willing to bleed

So just take a chance
You're ready to fly
Feel what it is to be alive

It's euphoria
Out of the blue, into the light
Let it shine down all over you, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
Under the moon, take in the night
Let each day start yourself anew, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

It's euphoria
Out of the blue, into the light
Let it shine down all over you, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
Under the moon, take in the night
Let each day start yourself anew, yeah
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
You gotta give love to get love
In euphoria
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
You gotta give love to get love
In euphoria
You gotta give love to get love

In euphoria
