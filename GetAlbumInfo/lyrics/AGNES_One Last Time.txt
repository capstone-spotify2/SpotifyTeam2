Beat. Drum. Iâm gonna lose him 
Just like water through my hands 
Light hits your face and you look at me like Iâm a stranger 
So far away, but still so near 

And you can blame it on my crazy heart. 
I got lost, you got torn apart 
I wish you would let me hold you 
Let me hold you 
One last time 

If this is over, if this is the end 
If you donât wanna see my face again 
Please just let me hold you 
Let me hold you, one last time 

Last night when you were sleeping 
I danced away, I flew so high 
I let you down and then I woke up next to a stranger 
I canât believe, what have i done 

And you can blame it on my crazy heart. 
I got lost, you got torn apart 
I wish you would let me hold you 
Let me hold you 
One last time 

If this is over, if this is the end 
If you donât wanna see my face again 
Please just let me hold you 
Let me hold you, one last time 

I donât know what to say anymore 
I donât want it to end up this way 
If you would only give me the chance 
I know I could do so much better 

And you can blame it on my crazy heart. 
I got lost, you got torn apart 
I wish you would let me hold you 
Let me hold you 
One last time 

If this is over, if this is the end 
If you donât wanna see my face again 
Please just let me hold you 
Let me hold you, one last time 

One last time 
One last time 
One last time 
One last time
