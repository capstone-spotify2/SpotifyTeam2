Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, In the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of, peace here.

Let me sleep it's, where I dream
And it all makes sense to me
What people run for cover,
But I, stand out, and shout, into the sky to

Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, in the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of peace here.

You said you'd teach me, how to disappear
Bells ring out and you tried, couldn't find me here
So you kept on searching, showing the one who's lost
And I'm flying over, houses and farms and
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down

Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, in the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of peace here
(would you carry me away)
I have no fear
(would you carry me away)
(would you carry me away)
