Well the sky broke in two,
I Found you dancing alone.
And the room filled up with you,
And that song we both know.

That's when u caught me with your eyes
Send seivers down my spine
Then you whispered in my ear
You said I could feel it too
And then you pulled me into you

Tonight,
I got you where I want you.
Closer I can tell you anything,
You're the song that I sing.

Tonight,
Let the music take us over.
We'll fall into forever, all is right,
Cause I got you where I want you.

Tonight
Tonight

Through all of science and history,
Well nothing ever stuck with me
But now I am locked onto you and I m holding onto
The only thing I know
And now I am never letting u go
Tonight,
I got you where I want you.
Closer I can tell you anything,
You're the song that I sing.

Tonight,
Let the music take us over.
We'll fall into forever, all is right,
Cause I got you where I want you.

Tonight,
Tonight,
The whole world could fall away,
But You and I, no we won't be afraid.

Tonight,

I got you where I want you,
Closer I can tell you anything.

Tonight,

Let the music take us over,

We'll fall into forever, all is right
Cause I got you where I want you,
Tonight
