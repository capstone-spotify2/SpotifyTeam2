Never win and never lose
There's nothing much to choose
Between the right and wrong
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Still things aren't quite the same
Between you and me

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine

I still hear your voice at night
When I turn out the light
And try to settle down
But there's nothing I can do
'Cause I can't live without you
Any way at all

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine

Tick-tock...

Oh I'm sure
No harm will come to you no more
'Cause I find myself in your hands
Don't you be so hard on yourself

Oh oh ooh ooh
