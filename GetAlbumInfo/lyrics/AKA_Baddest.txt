Tell me will you be there?
Tell me will you be there?
Club going up, kings of the weekend
Solid gold chain, over silk V-neck
First you get the money then you get the respect
I'll be with the North God living easy
That's who put the boy on, that's my team mate
Bought a sport car, and some real estate
Now them niggas can't stand when they see me

And I wish you were there mas'khipa kanje
My clique get ahead, mas'fika akulalw'
One chick in the bed, 5 Skipas' love
I got more, but you wouldn't want the truth
You headed to the top floor, I'm chilling on the roof
Henny to the Goose from the kitchen to the booth
Heavy with the youth, war already with the proof
I don't want them all, I just want a bad <i>[?]</i>
You never took calls nou di las ba'bela
Took her to the mall kanti uzand'phaphela
Bang'hleba mang' ngena, I reply with Mandela

My outfit on some "This ain't out yet"
Money talks, it's a public service announcement
Everyone know who the baddest in the South is
So I put my gold status where my mouth is
Do you know what it feel like to get to the pinnacle?
Beverly hills life, let's dip in the swimming pool
We getting physical, let's fuck in the living room
I'm in my element but you got the mineral
It's critical
Every rap king need a theme song
Every trap queen need a king kong
Put you on the team, put the ring on
Long live Super Mega live long
Mabebeza you the missing piece to my Jigsaw
Champagne bottle stained with your lip gloss
Weekend getaway to the Vic Falls
I'm a big star in the game, Chris Paul

She got me feeling like the baddest
Motherfucker on the planet, ooh yeah

<i>[Khuli Chana:]</i>
And we are better than, tougher than ever before
So easy to love, it's so harder to let go
Bare "Why o sa monyale?" man I gotta stay on the road
Gotta get this money tree in the bank for us to grow
Big picture thinker, ducking the paparazzi
Staying out of Shwashi scriptures
She's a praying mosadi ga satane a nteka
Momma told me it will be cheaper to keep her
I made momma lefika
That's my bundle of boitumelo
Walking taller than super model, stiletto
My heart singing in that Dana's falsetto
High as the polo lights in the ghetto
How she get when I'm in the middle
How she swallow what's on the menu?
Barking maar ha a na meno
Ncwanya ngwanyana eno
Stocking, stocking, stalking an instrumental
Bumping, tswakin', fucking it up a little
