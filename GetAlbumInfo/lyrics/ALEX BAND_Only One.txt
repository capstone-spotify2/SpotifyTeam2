My eyes are painted red
The canvas of my soul,
Slowly breaking down,again
Today I heard the news
The stories getting old
When will we see the end?
Of the days, we bleed for what we need
To forgive, forget, move on
Cause we've got

One life to live
One love to give
One chance to keep from falling
One heart to break
One soul to take us
Not for sake us,
Only one
Only one

The writting's on the wall
Those who came before
Left pictures frozen still, in time
You say you want it all
But whose side you fighting for?
I sit and wonder why
There are nights, we sleep, while others they weep
With regret, repent, be strong
Cause we've got

One life to live
One love to give
One chance to keep from falling
One heart to break
One soul to take us
Not for sake us
Only One
Only One

Just you and I
Under one sky

One life to live
One love to give
One chance to keep from falling
One heart to break
One soul to take us
Not for sake us
Only One
Only One
