I feel like going on, yes, I do
I said, I, I feel like going on, ohh
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy
I don't know 'bout you
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy, yes I do

Ohh, I feel like shouting for joy
I feel like shouting for joy
I feel like shouting for joy

Ohh, I, I feel like going on

Hey I, I feel like going on

Ohh, I feel like going on
I feel like going on, gotta move on
I feel like going on

I feel like going on

Ohh, I, I feel like going on, yes I do
I don't know 'bout you
Ohh, I, I feel like going on, yes I do
And I gotta move

Ohh I, I feel like shouting for joy
I don't mind at all, now
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy
Yes, I do

Movin' on, movin' on, movin' up the <i>[?]</i>
Takin' my time, packin' my bags
Sayin' hello to the friends along the way

Oh I, I feel like, I don't know 'bout you tonight but I, hey
