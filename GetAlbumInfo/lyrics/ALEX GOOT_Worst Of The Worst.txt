How can it be that opportunity isnât knocking at my door?
When will I find a better source of entertainment
than my current unsuccessful, selfish one?
When worst comes to worst I need a helping hand
- will you be there in the end?
I hurt myself more than anybody else.
Will you notice me?

Itâs hard to see anything working out for me with my own finances paying.
I canât take care of myself let alone anybody else,
I guess weâll simply have to wait and see.
Because she never left me at any time,
and because she stuck right by my side, I owe her my life..
Because she gave me everything she can
and she would do it again,
I owe her my life
