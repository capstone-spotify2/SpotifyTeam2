Ready? Azura

I took <i>[?]</i> of a thousand stars
You're the apple of my eye
I never felt a love like this before
You make me wanna cry
Little darling, when you go away
Know that I'm still there with you
I thank you make me smile
Remember I love you
When I saw you
Life just began
A heart started beating as one

You're my life
I'll always hope you're safe
You're my life
First time I saw your face
Just with your kiss
You melt the clouds away, the rainy day
No matter what I go through
Loving you is what I'm here to do

This is why I wrote a little song for you
Wanna show you what I do
And whatever comes and goes
If you ever feel alone
Know I feel it too
I look to heaven, now I'm so alive
I can't believe you're mine
I thank you make me smile
I'm freaking like butterfly
When I hold you
Feel one like the sun
A love like this can't be undone

You're my life
I'll always hope you're safe
You're my life
First time I saw your face
Just with your kiss
You melt the clouds away, the rainy day
No matter what I go through
Loving you is what I'm here to do

Eternally blue sky
Written in stars
Uncontainable love, even on my heart
Delivering a message from my room to the charts
Is how I make it living
Giving you the right star
You're number one in life
So make the best of you
Hope you get up high
To yourself be true
I'm here to do what I do
Whatever that I do
I do it just for you

You're my life
I'll always hope you're safe
You're my life
First time I saw your face
Just with your kiss
You melt the clouds away, the rainy day
No matter what I go through
Loving you is what I'm here to do
