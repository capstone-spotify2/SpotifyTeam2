Heaven's not for saints
You only have one cup
Now you've filled it up
Let it go, babe - just let it go

Dimlit path ahead
The road is wide
But your eyes are red
Let it go, babe - just let it go

Child, my brother
My brother look around you
The night is calling you
Close to the edge
Who knows the distance
The distance when light fades away

The river knows the way
The father is your son
Life has just begun
Let it go, babe - just let it go

Child, my brother 
My brother look around you
The night is calling you
Close to the edge
Who knows the distance
The distance when light fades away

Just let it go...
...'cos heaven's not for saints
