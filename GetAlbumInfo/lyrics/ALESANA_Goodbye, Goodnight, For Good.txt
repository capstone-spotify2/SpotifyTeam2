Jealousy rears its ugly head
I won't forget the things you said before
Goodbye, goodnight, for good...remember my face when you feel the pain

Help me to sleep...
Help me to sleep...

Now I'll fight with my eyes closed (with my eyes closed)
for the things I've let go
Sweet breath escapes...
choke on the lies that were your last goodbye
Hear my voice as you sleep...
Sleep tight, goodnight...
choke on the lies that were your last goodbye

Helps me to sleep without your memory
And my shattered dreams collect dust on what used to be a lie
It haunts me no more and now you're gone, you've left me alone
I wasn't wrong to feel this way inside so goodbye, goodnight, for good

Now I'll fight with my eyes closed (with my eyes closed)
for the things I've let go
Sweet breath escapes...
choke on the lies that were your last goodbye
Hear my voice as you sleep...
Sleep tight, goodnight...
choke on the lies that were your last...

I find pleasure in the taste of your decay
I anxiously watch you fade away

I can't explain what's happening inside of me
I refuse to fight you anymore
All I know is I have to make sure...make sure you never wake up again

Soft flesh gives way to trembling hand...

Beautiful eyes are sewn shut
Searing thread suffocates the light (the light)
