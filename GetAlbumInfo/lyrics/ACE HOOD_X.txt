Uh, some say I'm the voice, give my people hope
I'm the chosen one, some say I'm the GOAT
This that holy ghost don't you overdose
This that living legend hands around your fuckin' throat, get it?
I am a menace I am the end ain't no fucking beginnin'
It ain't no question bout who is the realest
Niggas are gimmicks they gotta be kiddin'
Follow my lead and I show you the way
I am believin' and walkin' in faith
Real nigga shit we can never relate
People are not who they seem to portray
Look in my eyes look in my soul
You niggas hoping a youngin' a fold
I know the difference to friend and a foe
You know the way I'm a play them up close
Told you way back in 08 I'm too cold Chincilla
No I'm too raw you too flawed don't act up Ben Stiller
Feeling like Lil Wayne my block hot my shirt off I'm realer
Please don't push me cause you pussy like gynecologists niggas
One for the people who counted me out
Give them a piece of the beast of the south
I hear the mumbles they cover their mouth
I came to see what the hype is about
Niggas in foreign cars with big rollies and a gold chain shit rented
I just lol at you lame guys but I need to mind my business
I'm on some hoodnation I am a first round pick
I'm going hard as the pavement
Wait on the day when the wave hit
When I'm in Dubai I have <i>[?]</i> smoking on Shisha that taste good
We had that suite on the ninth floor
Living the vision we prayed for

Ooo
Hope this hold you over to my next shit
I been dropping hits I dropped another hit
That's right put me on some other shit
I'm an alien that's why I'm in this mothership
She just ain't my lady that's my partner there
I can't even lie she got me pussy whipped
I can't even lie she help me elevate
I feel so alive after I meditate
Oo, got me stunting on my X bitch
Oo, I had to block her like I'm Tetris
Oo, might buy a ring for my new chick
Oo, she got me thinking bout engagement
Switch, got me stunting on my X bitch
Oo, I had to block her like I'm Tetris
Oo, might buy a ring for my new chick
Oo, she got me thinking bout engagement
