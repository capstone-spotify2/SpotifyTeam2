Seeing you at the villa
Acting like nothing's out
Absolute killers
Running on broken trust
Seeing right through me
I'm looking through you, too
You really knew me
Now it's all done and through

You're losing oxygen
And I can't find the words
The air is getting thin
Silence is all we heard
You know our last goodbye
Keeps playing through my mind like
"Ah-ah-ah"

Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath

When you think about me
Do you remember when
You were all about me
Or am I just a myth?
I loved you hardest
Happy, just loving you
And to be honest
Sometimes I think I still do

You're losing oxygen
And I can't find the words
The air is getting thin
Silence is all we heard
You know our last goodbye
Keeps playing through my mind like
"Ah-ah-ah"

Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath

Ooh, I'm coming up for air
Ooh, I'm coming up for air

Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath
So save your breath
So save your breath
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So save your breath
Woah-oh-oh, now, n-now
So save your breath
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
Love was already dead
So save your breath
