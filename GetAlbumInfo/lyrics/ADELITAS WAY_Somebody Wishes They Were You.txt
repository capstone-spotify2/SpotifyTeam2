Paralyzed and you don't know why
Feeling like somebody's fool
Try to find some peace of mind
Maybe you're hiding the truth
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold
But I want to tell you what I've been told

Life ain't that bad,
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

In your eyes I see the fight
Of someone with nothing to lose
Change alone's not set in stone
'Cause I see a lot left in you
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold
But I want to tell you what I've been told

Life ain't that bad,
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

Live for it,
Go for it
I know that you want it
Life is good

Run for it,
Try for it
Live for it,
Die for it
It's the only shot you have

Life ain't that bad
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you <i>[x2]</i>
