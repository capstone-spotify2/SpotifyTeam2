Sometimes I just get so frustrated
I don't even bother sleeping anymore
And all of this seems overrated
In all of us there's all the things we've said and done
If we see them lying on the floor

And I, asked them why
Can they remember
All this will be forgotten
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Days go by
I just can't keep track of the time

Dreams are made for fools and sages
Everybody leaves with what they came here for
Still they gotta keep certain pages
And all of us is all the things we wish we done
If we could see them wash upon the shore

And I, asked them why
Can they 

Remember
All this will be forgotten
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Days go by
I just can't keep track of the time

I'm going back to the way it was
This feeling can't be wrong
It's coming on way too strong
I'm going back to the way it was
This feeling can't be wrong
It's coming on way too strong

Remember
All this will be forgotten
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Days go by (All of this will be forgotten)
Days go by (There's nothing we can do to stop them)
Days go by (All of this will be forgotten)

Be forgotten
Be forgotten
