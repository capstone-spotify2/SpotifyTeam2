Say lady well look at you baby
You ain't gettin' older
Just finer and finer
It's been so long my baby
So many lonely nights
I almost rang your line
To say could you still be mine

Hey, hey lady
I've never been quite the same
The same
And I go crazy, crazy, crazy
Whenever I hear your name

And say baby I guess you heard
I'm doin fine
I'm makin' lots of money now
Got stars for friends
But I, but I can still remember
When we had nothin'
Nothin but love to share
To share until the end of time

Hey, hey lady
I've never been quite the same
The same
And I go crazy, crazy, crazy
Whenever I hear your name
