Well once upon a time 
When I held you in my arms 
On a blanket in the grass 
Where we'd watch the falling stars 
Under that old maple tree 
We'd share secrets in the dark 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And we lived, laughed, and loved as if 
There were no tomorrow 
Up until the day you went away 
Leaving only sorrow 

Now the stars don't shine 
The way they used to do 
Like they did when you were mine 
Perhaps they're lonely too 
You can barely read the names 
That I carved inside a heart 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Sometimes I think of you 
And I just have to smile 
Though forever never was 
At least we had a little while 
How time flies when you're young 
Just like the flicker of a spark 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park
