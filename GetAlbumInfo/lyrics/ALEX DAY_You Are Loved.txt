If I could make the flowers grow
Id be sure to fill your room with roses
And then if you feel that times are hard
Then you know you'd have a private garden

And if I could clear the clouds away
You could spend all afternoon stargazing
And at night the light would touch the moon
And beam down onto you

If I could reach out
This is what I'd say
That I wish you joy every day
And I hope you always know that
You are loved
You are loved

If I could change the blue of the sky
Every morning you would be surprised
It might remind you to be still
And breathe and be alive and feel fulfilled

If I could make the grass grow soft
You could walk the dogs without your shoes on
Lay down relaxed amongst the reeds
And smile yourself to sleep

If I could reach out
This is what I'd say
That I wish you joy every day
And I hope you always know that
You are loved
You are loved

If I could reach out
This is what I'd say
That I wish you joy every day
And I hope you always know that
You are loved

And if I could reach out
This is what I'd say
That I wish you joy every day
And I hope you always know that
You are loved
You are loved
This is what I'd say
That I wish you joy every day
And I hope you always know
That you are loved
You are loved
