We thought that this would be different
Yea, and we were so right
Say it with me, âI am the one who dreamsâ
Trust in your heart
Accomplish everything, see everything you could not live without

This is a big mistake, Iâm second guessing my way
Stay off of the ground, itâs so easy to take chance
Say you think its good for me and Iâll stop being reckless
Damn I hope youâre right

Itâs time to step away and take another glance
Itâs time to walk away and maybe have a fighting chance
Itâs time to step away and dance another dance
Itâs time to walk away and leave behind a sweet romance

You take my breath away, you take my breath away

We will sing this song together tonight, âYou take my breath awayâ
Close your eyes, think of me, please take my breath away
I will be alright, memories survive through the night

I never promised you, I never promised you
I never promised you this would get easier
I never promised you, I never promised you
I never promised you this would get easier

You take my breath away, you take my breath away

We will sing this song together tonight, âYou take my breath awayâ
Close your eyes, think of me, please take my breath away
I will be alright, memories survive through the night

If you go Iâll break, donât go Iâll wait
If we go youâll break, beg me to stay
If you go Iâll break, donât go Iâll wait
If we go youâll break, beg me to stay

Oh no, I want you to know youâre not alone
I hope that you really know youâre not alone

Itâs tearing me apart, weâve seen this before
Itâs tearing me apart
