You gotta take it easy
You gotta live your life
Yesterday's heroes
They are born to die

The people always blame you
It don't matter what they say
You've got your own freedom
You've gotta go your way

Get up and roll on

'cause there is no future
And there'll be no past
Live for today
The going is going fast

Get up and roll on
Get up and go on
The going's going fast

You are
Ahead of the pack
Ahead of the pack
Never look back
'cause you're ahead
Ahead of the pack

Don't you kill the feelings
Live to your heart
You're miles away
But you know where to start

Now you've got the muscle
To knock out a lie
'cause you're ahead of the pack
No one will spit in your eye

Get up and roll on
Get up and go on
The going's going fast

You are
Ahead of the pack
Ahead of the pack
Never look back
'cause you're ahead
Ahead of the pack

Ahead of the pack
Ahead of the pack
Never look back
Ahead of the pack

Ahead of the pack
Never look back
Ahead of the pack

Ahead of the pack
