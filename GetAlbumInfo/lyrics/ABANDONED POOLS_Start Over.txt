What a mess our lives turned out to be
It was at its best when you and I were only 3
We can start with all the things that turn us out
And we can go right down the list and throw them out

Can we start over?
It's over

Here you are and there's where you wanna be
But don't think you don't have company
Think of all the lonely people in the world
And if it's God who made us why we so damn cruel

We can never lie
And you can never steal the time
And we can only watch them die
And we can never find out why
