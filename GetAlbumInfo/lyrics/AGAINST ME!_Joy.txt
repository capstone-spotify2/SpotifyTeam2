All's quiet, except for this song. 
So maybe while I'm not together I can feel like I'm not alone. 
And somewhere off in the distance, rapidly advancing, is an onslaught of sorts. 
Young sirens wail in a skewed sense of glory. 
And the lions in the cages roar at the memory of fight. 

And there's a joy, a joy in all I can see. 
A joy, in every possibility. 

And all around us is a great, great failing. 
American rockets red-glare in a most 
disgusting triumph. 
And in passing I am asked "Do you believe in a God?", 
I shrug off the answer, continue to get high 
in this terror of no explanation. 
I am looking for a faith. 
My panic is an only reason. 

There's a joy, a joy in all I can see. 
A joy, in every possibility.
