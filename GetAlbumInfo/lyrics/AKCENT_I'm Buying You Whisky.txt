Tonight I am clubbing, tonight I'm with you
I'm buying you whisky, I make out with you
Go on and touch me, I love when you do
Lost in the music 
We go... la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I'm in love with you
We go... la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I'm in love with you

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
Baby, wanna be alone with me
Cause I wanna be your lover tonight
Baby, let me buy one more drink
Cause I wanna be your lover tonight. <i>[x2]</i>

Tonight I am clubbing, tonight I'm with you
I'm buying you whisky, I make out with you
Go on and touch me, I love when you do
Lost in the music 
We go... la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I'm in love with you
We go... la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I'm in love with you

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
Baby, wanna be alone with me
Cause I wanna be your lover tonight
Baby, let me buy one more drink
Cause I wanna be your lover tonight. <i>[x4]</i>
