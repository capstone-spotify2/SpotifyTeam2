Sweet China lady - few dollars for a night
I want you baby, so hold me tight

Come on - let's do it now
Come on - don't waste time
Come on - need you right now - come on

Set me on fire the whole way night long
Feel my desire, or break this down

Come on - need you tonight
Come on - I feel alright
Come on - down in my grave - come on

Sweet China Lady
Don't bring me down - no no no
Sweet China Lady
It's time tonight, I want you
Sweet China Lady
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

Just another one night stand - I wanna be free
'til the break of dawn - then we are free

Come on - just you and me
Come on - Give me your love
Come on - can't get enough - come on

Sweet China Lady
Don't bring me down no no no
Sweet China Lady
It's time tonight - I want you
Sweet China Lady
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
