Like a lightning storm
From out of the blue
You made them believe
You came from up above

Like a symphony
Everywhere you are
Ringing out
For you and your paradise

Yeah it's you up there
Hope you're not
Scared of heights

You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone
You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone

When you're in the light
People come alive
Don't you need
Some reality

When they call your name
Do you realize
That you got
What they're longing for

Yeah it's you up there
Hope you're not
Scared of heights

You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone
You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone

Angels cry
When you're up that high and wave goodbye
When you come down
There is no more light

You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone
You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone
You're like God
You're like God
But don't you feel alone
Don't you feel alone
