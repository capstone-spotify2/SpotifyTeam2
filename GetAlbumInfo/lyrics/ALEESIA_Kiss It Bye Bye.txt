Finally famous in this
Tell 'em, tell 'em

Mrs. Bartender you say it's my last shot
When I got up on in that game
You was my number one mascot
You was the one that I was flying out

We was the one that everyone just
Kept on lying about
Now you tell me
"Woah there, stop, back it up"
Girl, I think you're tripping
It's no wonder why you packing up

I'm out here doing numbers
But you say it's not adding them
Cause I told you
You plus me it's all I need and that's enough
You say that I'm Hollywood
Well you're the one acting up

I'm trying to make history
But you say that we're history
Girl, I know that you're missing me

<i>[Aleesia:]</i>
They say that a picture's worth a thousand words
So how come I can only think of two
When I look at yours

We used to be three, yeah
Used to be me all stuck
Getting lost in those petty brown eyes
So look me in the face and beg me to say
Cause this could be the very best last time

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

One last chance boy
This is no joke
You should know "I'm sorry"
Don't cut it no more

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

They say you don't know what you have
Till it's gone, yeah
But I say that you knew it all along
No matter what I get caught up in your issues

Why do I try when I know I can't fix you
You need to listen up
You're really messing up
Go ahead, call me bluff
I mean that when I say

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

One last chance boy
This is no joke
You should know "I'm sorry"
Don't cut it no more

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

If you want me to stay
I want you to cry
I want you to beg boy
Don't ask why

When I say jump
You say how high
And I say don't stop
Till you touch the sky

Maybe then I'll start to believe
Everything that you say you mean
So come and kiss me
Make it better baby please

Don't make me leave
Don't make me leave, no, no
Don't make me leave, no

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

One last chance boy
This is no joke
You should know "I'm sorry"
Don't cut it no more

You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye

You can kiss it bye bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye bye
