You and me sitting here spinning gears
We're like a stolen car
Hand in mine, feeling like this is right
But it's just not ours

The greatest pretenders forget to remember
the lies
We're falling forever, we're far from together
tonight

The light at the tunnel is a runaway train
The stars that we wish on are only airplanes
The love that we're chasing is a heart break away
'Cause we're picture perfect in a broken frame

Time is on neither side, no one's wrong
And no one's right
Hiding pain, Novocaine is gonna fade
There's no good in goodbye

The greatest pretenders forget to remember
the lies
We're falling together, the ties that we sever
tonight

The light at the tunnel is a runaway train
The stars that we wish on are only airplanes
The love that we're chasing is a heart break away
'Cause we're picture perfect in a broken frame

Gotta open up, open up
Gotta open up, open up

The light at the tunnel is a runaway train
The stars that we wish on are only airplanes
The love that we're chasing is a heart break away
'Cause we're picture perfect in a broken frame
In a broken frame
In a broken frame
