Konvict
Stand up
Salute
Devon Stephens
Up front is in the building
It's the konvict album
Yeah
Yall done fucked up now
I got money now nigga
I got enough money to free all the stars

He ain't lying
If you selling we ain't buying
If it's scattered on ya block
You best believe we supplyin'
From a key down to a half a pound
A quarter to a dime
Tryin' to own a piece of Brooklyn
Like my niggas John Klein
Hey
Ya know me I'm known to rock wit it
Roll through your spot wit it
Post up block wit it
Hey ya know me I'm on the block with it
Non-stop wit it
Violate and get popped wit it
Hey
So I suggest ya keep stepping on me
Cause you will rarely find me
Without my weapon on me
Got the whole konvict squad bettin on me
And now the dots around the world
Are now connectin' on me

Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them ghats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down

Oh oh oh hey hey hey

A fleet of European cars in my driveway
Murcielago, Gallardo, Ferrari
My shortie ridin' shotgun
Bumping sadie
Toes hangin' out the window
Loadin' up my army
You know I keep a bad bitch breathin' on me
Also known to have no business with no beefing on me
And won't hesitate to cock it
When them people on me
So guess what
No exceptions to ya neither homie
Ya know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction
I'm a star, style changed
Hangin' like blow
Black royals in the front
We in the place now

Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them ghats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down

Now Ima show ya how to break this down
He'll show ya how to shake this down
First nigga to create this sound
Can't believe it took a konvict to shake this town
Dippin' European linen with the v-net
Diamond studded vvs
No less
Kunta kinte bracelet
Lit up the whole set
My nigga we on deck
Believe it's no sweat
Need street credibility who you go get
I give you that credibility for the right check
Keep your future on the shelf
Quiet where it's best kept
Don't want them upfront shooters
Bringin' red light

Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them ghats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down
