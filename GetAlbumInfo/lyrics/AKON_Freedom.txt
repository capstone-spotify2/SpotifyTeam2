Everything I have, everything I own 
All my mistakes man you already know 
I wanna be free, I wanna be free (Konvict) 

From Senegal West Africa, 
To St. Louis, Missouri 
Thanks to Catherine Dana 
For giving my pops his glory 
He came down with his drum 
And a dream to change the world 
In a free uplifting world 
And that's all he ever want 
Mom came a little after 
Gave birth to my brother 
then all of the pressure 
Made em' fight one another 
See, the pain would never last 
Did the best with what they had 
He knew the world was out for grabs 
And he searched to find his

As a kid I never knew 
I'd have to hustle just to make it through 
So I found myself skipping school 
Cause' the girls don't think I'm cool 
And because of that I didn't care 
Whether or not I went to jail 
I just wanna be treated fair 
Cause thats all I ever knew 
Tellin' me I need to slow down 
Cause everybody in the whole town 
Cause they know how I get down 
Foreigner from another town 
Can you believe we still around? 
After so many hit the ground 
And we ain't gon stop now 
Until we get that
