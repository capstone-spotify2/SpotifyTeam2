I wanted to take you
From those robes to feel the cold
Undressing the blessings
Feels like my afterlife, my afterlife

I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights
Somehow, over and over
I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, Iâm over

I wanted to keep you
But I was told youâd grown too old
For someone who stayed young by bleeding light
My afterlife... is black and cold

I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights
Somehow, over and over
I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, Iâm over

I go on 
Yet on that night I went down with the lights
Somehow, over and over
I go on 
They carried me out when the lights went out 
Over, Iâm over
