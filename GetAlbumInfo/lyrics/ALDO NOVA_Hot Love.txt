Lord have mercy, I'm on the line
My body's shaking and my head is on fire
I've got a fever and its making me run
Because getting hot really is no fun

So let me make this clear
I've got love coming out of my ears
And baby you're so hot
So come on and do it and give me alot of
Hot love in the night; makes me feel right
Well can you blame me if I want some hot love
Every night you do it so right
So baby do it and do it again and do it again
Do it and do it and do it again

You're lovin so hot that its almost a sin
My heart is pumping like its under the gun
Cause getting hot really is no fun

So let me make it clear 
I've got love coming out of my ears
And baby I'm so hot
So come on and do it, Ill give you a shot of
Hot love in the night makes me feel right
Well can you blame me if I want some hot love
Every night you do it so right
Baby do it and do it again, do it and do it again
