I see us walking in the sand
That's when we said our first hello
Two perfect strangers hand in hand
Give me more of your voice,
I can't resist it

I'm sitting in my car, so tired
I've had enough of broken dreams
The rain is pouring, I've just been fired
My self-esteem needs a glee

Woah...
Bla Bla Bla on the radio
Give me some music I can listen to
Give me that music, 'cause I want to listen, oh oh
Bla Bla Bla on the radio
I've been Waiting for our song to play
Baby let us run away
I'm waiting for our song to play
I'm not over you

I'd like you to take me back to last Summer
So far away from where we are
Our tropic night will last forever
Our final "au revoir"

Woah...
Bla Bla Bla on the radio
Give me some music I can listen to
Give me that music, 'cause I want to listen, oh oh
Bla Bla Bla on the radio
I've been Waiting for our song to play
Baby let us run away
I'm waiting for our song to play
I'm not over you

I see us walking in the sand
That's when we said our first hello
Two perfect strangers hand in hand
Give me more of your voice,
I can't resist it
O-o-oh...

On the radio, I can listen to

Oh-oh-oh!
Bla bla bla on the radio
Oh-oh-oh
Give me some music I can listen to <i>[2x]</i>

Bla bla bla on the radio, oh oh oh,
bla bla bla on the radio, oh oh oh
