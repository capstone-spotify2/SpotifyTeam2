<i>[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]</i>
They call me ghetto neighbor, I don't give a fuck
Sounds bumpin' all night, steadily wakin' you up
Homies bangin' on the door because I'm slangin' the tree
24 hour weed spot, buy two, get one free
Every week another piece of property gettin' stolen
Check it in you little buster watch your eye get swollen
Neighborhood bad ass, I think the whole block hates me
Ready to freeze psycho motherfucker actin' crazy
Ever since the young age of 13
Same house, different neighbors and they all blame me
For all them cars that got stolen, the windows that got broken
A handful of jewelry that the cops caught me holdin' (Psyche)
I've never been caught for a run that I commited
I've never seen a fat ass lick and didn't hit it
All the murders that they claimin' I ain't stressin' that shit
Cause if you got the evidence then come convict me bitch

<i>[Hook]</i>
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

<i>[Verse 2: Monoxide]</i>
Cars and stray dogs always fuckin' up my grass
And everytime you see me comin' you know I'm about to ask
Where your 5 at? I'm buyin' weed in 10 sacks
And fuck a bitch at Burger King just to get some free snacks
Standin' on my porch in a robe
I got some top tens with no shoe strings, I'm out cold
And the gold, hope it ain't nothin' my eye catch
I'm runnin' pockets like a campaign rep it's gettin' snatched
Dice game on the side of the crib
I'm shootin' dollar in this motherfucker, who else in?
And the cops got a problem with me, who knows why?
Prolly cause I got a couple tagged cars in my driveway
I keep it ghetto like the whitest of trash
Sellin' food stamps for cash just to get up on the fat pad
So when you see me on your block watch your back
Cause Monoxide will lay a motherfucker out flat

<i>[Hook]</i>
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

<i>[Verse 3: Paris]</i>
Who's that nigga slash Nasdaq sponsored ass?
Soldier devils never love, fuckin' up your country club
Bailin' through the gates, raisin' hatred in they eyes why
Try to calculate when niggaz make it when I ride by
Though you can't stand seein' any non-European
Havin' things, what a shame niggaz come, then you fleein'
But we won't, goodies too, take advantage, better school
Bigger plots, acre lots, pushin' Benz and sellin' stocks
Guess who comin' to dinner in your area?
Know you hate to share it, I love it when I'm scarin' the
Bitches in my neighborhood, I'm brutal on your whole committee
Never seemed to see how niggaz comin' from the city pretty
But we rollin', foldin' the cash holdin', bitch I'm showin' out
Keep my bidness out yo mouth
Clowin' all them racist holes, juggalos know a devil should
Roughest on my cul de sac, there go the neighborhood

<i>[Hook]</i>
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
That's right motherfucker! Psychopathic is your (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
My man Paris and all that gorilla funk is your (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
