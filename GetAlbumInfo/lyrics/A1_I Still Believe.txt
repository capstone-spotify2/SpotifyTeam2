<i>[MARK:]</i> THE SUN WENT DOWN SO LONG AGO,
I WATCHED YOU CRY I HAD TO GO.
FOREVER ONLY LASTED JUST A DAY.
AND NOW WITHOUT YOU BY MYSIDE,
THE VISIONS OF A LONELY LIFE,
TAKE ME TO A DREAM IN A PLACE SO FAR AWAY.

I SEE AN ANGEL AND I THINK OF YOU,
I WATCH HER HIDE BEHIND A SMILE.
AND THEN I THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
IF ONLY I HAD LISTENED FOR A WHILE.

<i>[ALL:]</i> I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
A LOVE SO STRONG WILL CARRY ON,
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE SEEN.
I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
IT'S NOT THE END, LET'S START AGAIN.
I STILL BELIEVE.

<i>[MARK:]</i> THE EMPTINESS OF WHAT COULD BE,
SHOWS EVERYTHING YOU MEAN TO ME.
IT STARTED OUT A GAME I'D NEVER PLAYED.
IF I DEFY THE FOOLISH PRIDE,
AND FIND THAT PLACE SO DEEP INSIDE,
TAKE ME TO MY DREAM, I KNOW I HAVE TO STAY.

I SEE A RAINBOW AND I THINK OF YOU.
OF WHAT WE HAD, OF WHAT WE WERE
AND THEN I THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO
IF ONLY I HAD LISTENED FOR A WHILE.

<i>[ALL:]</i> I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
A LOVE SO STRONG WILL CARRY ON,
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE SEEN.
I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
IT'S NOT THE END LET'S START AGAIN.
I STILL BELIEVE.

<i>[MARK:]</i> EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS ASKING ME WHY,
WHY I DID, WHAT I DID TO MAKE YOU CRY.
PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY WHAT I SAY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GO AWAY.
AT THE TIME I COULDN'T STAY.

I SEE AN ANGEL AND SHE SEES ME TOO.
AND AS SHE WIPES A TEARY EYE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO,
TO START A NEW BEGINNING IN MY LIFE.

<i>[ALL:]</i> I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
A LOVE SO STRONG WILL CARRY ON.
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE SEEN
I STILL BELIEVE, I STILL BELIEVE,
IT'S NOT THE END LET'S START AGAIN
I STILL BELIEVE. YOU KNOW I STILL BELIEVE.

IT'S NOT THE END, LET'S START AGAIN.
I STILL BELIEVE.
