So maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I can't see
Well either one is fine
I speak redundantly
It's hard to say what's wrong
When you're diving in like me
I used to love
Relentlessly

So how can you remember everything?
Is there a rulebook for our love I'm not reading?
If we could just free up the laws that bind our lives
Then we could love
Yeah, we could love

Don't get me wrong here
I need you in my life
But we're independent people at the current time
I know that years from now
The day will finally come for us to love
Perpetually

So how can you remember everything?
Is there a rulebook for our love I'm not reading?
If we could just free up the laws that bind our lives
Then we could love
Yeah, we could love

This is where I draw the line this time
This just has to stop right here
If we can't just learn to live our lives
Then we don't have any hope at all

So how can you remember everything?
Is there a rulebook for our love I'm not reading?
If we could just free up the laws that bind our lives
Then we could love
Yeah, we could love

So how can you remember everything?
Is there a rulebook for our love I'm not reading?
If we could just free up the laws that bind our lives
Then we could love
Yeah, we could love
