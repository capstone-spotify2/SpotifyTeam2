I'm taking it back 
I'm making a pact
I will make you indispensable
I spoke to myself
Oh, I might as well
And let you just be made sensible

Tell me your thoughts so I can love you in spite of them
But now I'm happy if I never lose sight of them

I'll take it back 
I never said it did
And that's a fact 
As of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it back

Oh, lovers they come
Another call from
A phone booth somewhere in Lovertown
It isn't so bad 
Those others I've had
It isn't as if I'm losing ground

I'm getting better when I annex myself from you
It oughtta be another country I'm moving to

I'll take it back
I never said it did
And that's a fact 
As of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it back

I'd like to throw myself a million miles an hour
I'd like to feel before the feeling goes sour

So take it back 
I never said it did
And that's a fact 
As of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it
Now that the worst is over
I can just take it
Now that the worst is over
I can just take it back
