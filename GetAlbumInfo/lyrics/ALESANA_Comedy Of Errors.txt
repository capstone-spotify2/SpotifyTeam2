Iâve been here before am I losing my mind?
Look at me, tell me Iâm crazy
Weâre in danger
Follow me and youâll see things are not what they seem
Take my hand or donât you trust me?
We are in danger and Iâm the one to blame

At the edge of manâs reason there exist designs to escape reality
The tesseract calls to me
Cosmic strings shall be mine to pull
Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
Still she calls to me...

Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Iâm never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

Hush sweet baby donât say a word
Iâm ignoring destiny for reasons I canât tell you
We try to fool our minds
How long do we wait for salvation?
Is it a sin to wonder?
Get off your knees!

Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
Sheâs insane!
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Iâm never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can you hear me? Someoneâs talking
Can you see me? Someoneâs watching

Delusions of grandeur, where the hell am I? Save me from myself!
âcause I can no longer play this morbid game
Just when I thought it was over, here we go!
Galaxies welcome me inside!

Iâm insane!
Oh the horror! Oh the panic!
Paranoid and deranged! I am a God!
Psychotic and ashamed! Why! Why!

Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Iâm never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night
Iâm never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

It was a dark and stormy night...
Iâve traveled near and far, raced with all the stars
now alone Iâll be, subtle tragedy
If I had one more chance to just explore
I would take your hand and do it all again
