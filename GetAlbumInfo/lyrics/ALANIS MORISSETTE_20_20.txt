I would never have been in such a rush
I would never have tried to control
I would never have worn such 'fear lenses'
I would never have held on so tightly

I would have kept my boundaries set
My loving noâs, my unwavering yesâs
Risked abandonment and stood by that
And thereby felt constant connect

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wonât repeat with my understanding
This wouldnât have happened if i knew then what i know now

I wouldâve gone slower
Pushed infrequent
Would not have rushed into such commitment
I wouldâve shown restraint as my feet got wet
I wouldâve baby-stepped into intimate

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
This torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wonât repeat with my understanding
This wouldnât have happened if i knew then what i know now

I wouldâve known much more
Known that time was all we had for future depth to unfold
I wouldâve had more faith at every step
I wouldâve kept intact through the whole process

Oh this fountain of regret is looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wonât repeat with my understanding
This wouldnât have happened if i knew then what i know
