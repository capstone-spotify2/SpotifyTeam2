In the morning
On the beach there
People gather
To meet the sunshine

With open arms
Reaching for heaven
With open hearts
And open minds

I found a lover
By the seaside
With sexy brown skin
And haunting eyes

Time keeps passing
But no one cares
Life for living is the thing there
Be yourself, be free

In Bahia
And in Rio
In Sao Paulo
In Brasilia

Sandy beaches, cooling breezes
Sexy women calling to you
For you ahh, aha
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha
