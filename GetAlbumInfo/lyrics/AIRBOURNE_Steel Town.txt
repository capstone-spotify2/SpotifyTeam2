I work for a livin' 
So mr. don't call me sir 
I spend my whole life giving 
For nothing much in return but scars and burns 

Steel town 
Living in a steel town 
Free and proud 
Steel town 
Working in a steel town 
My hometown 

I got my high school sweet heart 
And my hometown team 
Yeah with my friends all drinking at the corner bar 
It's all that I need coz I'm living free 

Steel town 
Living in a steel town 
Free and proud 
Steel town 
Working in a steel town 
My hometown 
Keep on burning keep on turning 

I'm branded by the fire 
My bloods running hot 
And I'll be damned if I don't stand and fight 
Cause this steel town is all that we got 

Steel town 
Living in a steel town 
Free and proud 
Steel town 
Working in a steel town 
My hometown 
Steel town 
Living in a steel town 
Free and proud 
Steel town 
Working in a steel town
