I have a girl and Ruby is her name
She donât look at me but I love her just the same.

Ruby, ruby, how I want you,
Like a ghost Iâm gonna haunt you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

The next time Iâll see you
Give you my whole cries.
Iâm gonna steal you away from all those guys.

From the Sunday, the day I met you,
Iâve been in bed, Iâm gonna get you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

I got a girl and Ruby is her name
And I need a girl just to set her hall of fame.

Got some other money, too
Iâm gonna give it all of you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
