Don't you give me no line
Better run if you can
Just like a thorn in the side
So don't give me no

Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no lies

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll

Don't you play me no jive
A bit of fun on the side
Too much crap make you blind
So don't give me no

Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no whine

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
Listen up....
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said you can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
