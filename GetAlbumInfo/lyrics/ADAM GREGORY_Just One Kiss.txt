i woke up got outta bed
looked in the mirror
and my eyes were red
thinkin' where were you last night
mama called from downstairs
you better get running or you're gonna be late
so i took a pair of dirty jeans from the laundry pile
grabed the milk and the cheerios
i wolfed it it down in a minute or so
saying we're gonna talk tonight

well, chill out, let it go
it's no big deal mom but if you say so
i'll do a little better next time
i'll cut the grass and wash the car
for twenty dollars from the peanut butter jar
and just one kiss, bye bye!

you don't pay the bills and you don't pay rent
your friends come over
and you let them in
then you eat out of house and
home sweet home of mine,
that's right
i looked at mom as she shook her head and said
hey mom i'm gonna make my bed
well, "you just ain't no son of mine", mamma said
thanks mom can i borrow the car
our little lak sure helped a lot
i'll have it back in the parking lot
without a scratch this time

well, chill out, let it go
it's no big mom but if you say so
i'll do a little better next time
i'll cut the grass and wash the car
for twenty dollars from the peanut butter jar
and just one kiss, bye bye!

i turned the key and i backed up slow
with merle haggard on the radio
put it in drive and i let it go
squealin' out of sight

well, chill out, let it go
it's no big deal mom but if you say so
i'll do a little better next time
i'll cut the grass wash the car
for twenty dollars from the peanut butter jar
and just one kiss, bye bye!
