Hey you were standing by the screen door slamming
Rather clear whatâs taking place.
You were holding on to Louie
He was packing, he was heavy that plastic handle just about to break

Well then you picked up Chloe.
She knew yâall were going
She started barking like a tank.
I was shocked and I was joking,
But I would not be longing.
Cause I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whatâs left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youâre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I donât need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank

Well now you left screaming and your tires screeching
That little dog right in your lap
I have become a little sad and I called up my old dad
He said son you just woke me from my nap
I told him you had left me.
He said now son donât you hate me
You know exactly what I think.
You know youâre better off
You can fish and you can golf.
You still got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whatâs left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youâre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I donât need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank

Thatâs right

So I got out the whiskey I began to listen to songs out in my truck you couldnât crank
I started feeling empty, then again it hit me. I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whatâs left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youâre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I donât need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank
Yeah now go on and leave me baby
I donât need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Thatâs right, you go ahead, Iâll be a okay
Cause I got Jose, Captain Morgan
Not to mention Old George and Tammy, Loretta, Merell, Willie Nelson, Big John Cash
How about Old Jimmy Buffet bring him in there when itâs sun shining,  
George Strait an old friend
Canât forget Hank Jr and all his rowdy friends
Iâm gonna clean out the whole closet, baby
All yeah... Goodbye
