Can you hear me cry across the great divide
Do you hear me calling or are my tears just falling
In an ocean of regret, words left unsaid
I wish I could hold you, I wish that I could have that chance again
But when I close my eyes
I can see you there reaching out your hand to me
And I follow you through every dream
How I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you

Somehow over mountains
Somehow over seas
Love will break the silence
And bring you back to me
Love will bring you back to me
Somehow - break the silence

Give me wings to fly across the great divide
I'm trying to see tomorrow, I wish that I could borrow
Just a glimpse of what will be, just to hear you speak
These nights are getting longer, my love for you is growing stronger
As long as there is hope
I will send a prayer as far as the winds will blow
And I hope somehow you will know
How I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you

Somehow over mountains
Somehow over seas
Love will break the silence
And bring you back to me
Somehow there's an answer
Somehow I believe
Love will break, love will break the silence <i>[4x]</i>

And when I close my eyes
I can see you reaching out your hand to me
And I hope somehow you will see
How I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you

Somehow over mountains
Somehow over seas
Love will break the silence
And bring you back to me
Somehow there's an answer
Somehow I believe
Love will break the silence
Love will bring you back to me
