Without a whisper
Without a chore
All without ambition
That awaits 10,000's roar
The perfect vision
Of less is more
Awake in me
Lotus Flower

Without conditions
Without a door
Me &amp; my religion
Reachin' fame
And keepin' score
Somewhere the vision
Of less is more
Still waits in me
Lotus Flower

Those golden chimes
Ring in roundelay
In time chasin' pride away
Far away from sight
Somewhere tonight
A child is waiting

Those golden chimes
Ring in roundelay
In time chasin' pride away
Far away from sight
Somewhere tonight
A child is waiting

Without a whisper
Without a chore
All about ambition
That awaits 10,000's roar
The perfect vision
Of less is more
Awake in me
Lotus Flower
