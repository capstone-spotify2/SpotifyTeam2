Tell me what I gotta do

Everyday you're walkin' by
And I can see
How you shine
Here I am alone with nothin'
But a dream
That you are mine
Just exactly what I'll do
I don't know baby
But I gotta find
A way to reach you

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart 
Tell me what I need 
To know tonight
So everything will be all right

Every night I wonder
Just how it would feel
Close to you
I imagine that this
Fantasy is real
You love me too
Got to get from here to there
Here and now baby
Open up your arms
And let me love you

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart 
Tell me what I need 
To know tonight
So everything will be all right

Got to get from here to there
Here and now baby
Open up your arms
And let me love you

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart 
Tell me what I need 
To know tonight
So everything will be all right
