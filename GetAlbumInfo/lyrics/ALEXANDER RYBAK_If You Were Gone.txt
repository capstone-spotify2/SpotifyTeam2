If you were gone the moon would lose its brightness
Without your smile the finch would sing no more
And once in a while some waves would sigh with sadness
Remembering two lovers walking by the shore

If you were gone the days would all be pointless
And in the night I'd sing the song so blue
A song about spring and every happy moment
When I had all the time alone with you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But you're right here and nothing could be better
So take my hand and stay with me 'till dawn
And while the wind is playing with your sweater
I can't imagine life if you were gone...

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But you're right here and nothing could be better
So take my hand and stay with me 'till dawn
And while the wind is playing with your sweater
I can't imagine life if you were gone...

If you were gone the world would lose its meaning
Without your love how could I smile again
And though the sun would always keep on shining
I'd never shine without my dearest friend

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But you're right here and nothing could be better
So take my hand and stay with me 'till dawn
And while the wind is playing with your sweater
I can't imagine life if you were gone...
