Hallucinations
On the street
Going crazy
This cant be
All the people 
Look like you
Realization
It can't be true
Oh no, I'm in love :(
On the outside
I look the same
Nothing different
Normal day
But whats that feeling?
Butterflies
In my stomach
No I'm not fine
Oh no, I'm in love :(
Oh no! I'm in love :(
Now you are all I''m thinking of
Oh my what do i do
'Cos I not ready
To fall in love
With you
Saw a doctor
Said to her
Make me better
Please, it hurts
Diagnosis
The words are thin
Telling me what i had to hear
Oh no, I'm in love :(
Oh no! I'm in love :(
Now you are all I'm thinking of
Oh my what do i do
'Cos I'm not ready to fall in love
With you
Staring forward 
Paralyzed
I can smell you
Terrified
In need answers
What do I do
Help me,
I cant be in love with you
Oh no! I'm in love :(
Now you are all I'm thinking of
Oh my what do I do
'Cos I'm not ready
To fall in love with you
Now you are all I'm thinking of
Oh my what do I do
'Cos I'm not ready
To fall in love with you
