When I first met you got a feeling that I'll never forget
(An animal attraction I know)
We'd be bad together but the make up sex as good as it gets
And I just want to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you (love you)
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you (of you)
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just wanted you to know
Every time that I hate you
I love you (love you)
You're the part of the pain that I don't lie to (lie to)
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too (You love to hate me too)

Every time we fight I feel like breaking up but I know I can't
(No one ever gets me like you)
I learned a lesson it's a losing battle a war I can't win
And now I got to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you (love you)
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you (of you)
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just wanted you to know
Every time that I hate you
I love you (love you)
You're the part of the pain that I don't lie to (lie to)
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too

You love to hate me too
All these almost breakups
You love to hate me too
Are always worth the make ups
And if we make it through
I just want to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you
And I just wanted you to know
Every time that I hate you
I love you (love you)
You're the part of the pain that I don't lie to (lie to)
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too

You love to hate me too
All these almost breakups
You love to hate me too
Are always worth the make ups
And if we make it through
And I just wanted you to know
