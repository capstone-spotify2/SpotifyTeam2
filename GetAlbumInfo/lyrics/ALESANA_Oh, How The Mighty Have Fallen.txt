Iâm having trouble breathing
And if I donât think fast Iâm likely to find myself here for good
Panic sets in as I start to question
Why I see you standing there beyond the glass...

Who said that we never would touch the speed of light?
So far behind me, understanding
Stars become rivers flowing backwards, oh yea!
When did my heartbeat start to echo?
Why are my thoughts now fading, drifting, yea!
Twisting, yea! tearing, yea! bleeding, yea!

Excuse me, are you a maniac?
I am and Iâm okay with that

My moon, my stars,
One last night, one final kiss
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye my everything
Iâm terrified, I pull you near
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye my everything

An endless maze, a mobiÃ¼s labyrinth
Exodus, redemption, where have you gone!
And yet your gaze will not cease to burn into me!
So far removed, so mockingly you observe
Pariah, hypocrite! I will be free!
And yet you will remain

Excuse me, are you a maniac?
I am and Iâm okay with that

My moon, my stars,
One last night, one final kiss
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye my everything
Iâm terrified, I pull you near
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye my everything, goodbye my everything

No!
Futile screams go unheard
Incarcerated by so many walls
No!
Imprisoned and banished within a nexus of my own design

Donât go back, donât leave me
Hide from the world, letâs not exist
Please God kill me!

Time is mocking me and now Iâm fighting gravity, yea
Iâm destroying me, colliding worlds will set you free

A straight line is not the shortest distance between two points!
I know that now! But Iâm afraid it might be too late!

Will we come back from this?

Hold my hand, Iâm blind!
Show me how, Iâm lost!
My God itâs beautiful
The portal opens, time is slowing, no turning back now, âBel

My moon, my stars,
One last night, one final kiss
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye my everything
Iâm terrified, I pull you near
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye my everything, goodbye my everything

No!
Futile screams go unheard
Incarcerated by so many walls
No!
Imprisoned and banished within a nexus of my own design
