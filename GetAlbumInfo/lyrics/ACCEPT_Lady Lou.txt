Running through empty streets
Try to find my wife
C'mon, let's go to town
I wanna live my life

Lady I'm lovin' you
In my car I drive
Woman - I lose my way
'Cause you can't take me high

Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Won't you, won't you, won't you

Yeah, I see you, come here to me
I said Lay - Lady Lou
Money - I spent it all
I gave you all my life
Honey- don't fool me now
'Cause I don't wanna die

Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Don't you want me baby

Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Won't you, won't you, won't you

Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Don't you want me baby
