Day or night - seems always right
To execute a crime
But now it's time - to pull the plug
And stop this bloody game - this bloody game

They're black or white
Crime is colour blind
Rage is breaking loose
For our defence
It makes good sense
Lock 'em all away

We've gotta take out the crime
Start all over again
We've gotta clean up the slime
So we can live without pain

We have been told - a million times
Crime will never pay
The loss of life - is hard to take
When evil rules the day

We've gotta take out the crime
Start all over again
We've gotta clean up the slime
So we can live without pain
Take out the crime
You better watch out
When you clean up the slime

When they're doing time
They go out of their mind
They're beyond the point
The point of no return

We've gotta take out the crime
Start all over again
We've gotta clean up the slime
So we can live without pain

We've gotta take out the crime
Start all over again
Come on and kick out that slime
So there's a future again
