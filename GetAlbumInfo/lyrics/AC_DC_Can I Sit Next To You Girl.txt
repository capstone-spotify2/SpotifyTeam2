Well I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
Oh I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine, ha
That's when I said

Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you?

Intermission, we were doing alright
'Til this guy came up and stood by her side
Oh I took him by surprise
When I gave him one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine
And that's when I said

Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you, can I sit next to you
Yeah, I wanna
So let me!

Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, and then take you home
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, lick your ear
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
C'mon!

Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl, can I?
