Who do I see? 
Mirror let me know 
You can't know me in the way I do 
Can you see how I feel? I look different every day 
I appear in many ways 

Mirror please 
show my reflection 
Free of doubt 
the naked truth 

It goes deeper 
Do you dare to know 
What is hidden? 
What's behind the superficial and external look 
that no eyes will ever see 

Mirror please 
show my reflection 
Free of doubt 
the naked truth 

Oh, mirror please 
show my reflection 
Free of doubt 
the naked truth 

Free of test and youth... 

Mirror please 
show my reflection 
Free of doubt 
the naked truth 

Oh, mirror please 
show my reflection 
Free of doubt 
the naked truth
