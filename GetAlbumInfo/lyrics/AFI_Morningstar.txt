I saw a star beneath the stairs glowing through the melting walls. 
Who will be the first to begin their fall? 
Or will we become one? 

Am I the star beneath the stairs? 
Am I a ghost upon the stage? 
Am I your anything?

I saw a star beneath the stairs glowing bright before descent 
and in the morning there is nothing left but what's inside of me. 

Am I the star beneath the stairs? 
Am I a ghost upon the stage? 
Am I your anything?

Am I the star beneath the stairs? 
Am I a ghost upon the stage? 
Am I your anything?

And I don't want to die tonight; Will you believe in me? 
And I don't want to fall into the light. 

Will you wish upon? 
Will you walk upon me?
I don't want to die tonight. 


Will you believe in me tonight.

Am I the star beneath the stairs? 
Am I a ghost upon the stage? 
Am I your anything?

Am I the star beneath the stairs? 
Am I a ghost upon the stage? 
Am I your anything?
