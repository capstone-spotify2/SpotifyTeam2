What's that you're doing to yourself in the pouring rain?
What's all the notches? Would you care to explain?
You're soaking so you're making makeup is coming down
What's that you're doing to yourself in the rain?

What's that you're saying to yourself in the pouring rain?
Speak up please, I really can't hear a word you're saying
Looks to me that you've been thrown in at the deep end
I'd lend a hand but I hate getting wet

Still you're all in one wet piece
Blame it all on some coincidence
Now you put your face to bed
Down comes life and knocks your head

Still you're all in one wet piece
Blame it all on some coincidence
The rain has put your face to bed
Down comes life and knocks you dead
