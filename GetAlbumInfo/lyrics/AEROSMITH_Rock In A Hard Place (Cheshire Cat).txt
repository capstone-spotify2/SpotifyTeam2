It was a take it or a leave it 
Kinda Saturday night 
I wish I could love you 'til the cows come home 
If the make is right 
If it's a make believe I say it ain't 
And tell you then 
'Cause if it's a dream i'm in please wake me up 
and smile again 

Oooh, close your eyes and what do you see 
Oooh, look what in hell they did with your only belief 

She was a real top manner 
Lies and no conniver 
Heart pumpin' floozy 
Late night driver 
Her second hand clothes 
Smiling like a cheshire cat 

Said it was in and out and up and down the urchin moon 
Only a certain situation on the sea I'm who 
Putting the ring around the rose n' pull the daisy chain 
Cover your head and tell me you ain't from there and back again

Oooh, close your eyes what do you see 
Oooh, nothing but how you will live with your only belief in me 

She was a real top manner
Lies and no conniver
Heart pumpin' floozy
Late night driver
Her second hand clothes
Smiling like a cheshire cat

Give a good one I want to be or not to be tonight 
Why should I hold her down in bed when you should ride me right 
Want you to give it all you got, no need to make a mends
Cover your little mouth come up for air
I got the bends 
Oooh, close your eyes and what do you see 
Oooh, nothing but how you will live with your only belief in me 

She was a real top manner
Lies and no conniver
Heart pumpin' floozy
Late night driver
Her second hand clothes
Smiling like a cheshire cat
