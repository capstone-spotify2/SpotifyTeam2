I want your body, mind, soul, et cetera
And one day you'll see, you should give it to me
And I don't want anyone instead of ya
Oh babe I'm going crazy, come on and give it to me
And I ain't never met nobody better-er
You're someone else's baby

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realise
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya

Put your little hand in mine and
Look into my eyes, baby eyes
Oh you make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah you make me wanna listen to music again

There had been many moons before I met ya
And I don't know when I last put paper to pen
And now you give me back my raison d'Ãªtre
And I'm inspired again

And I know in some ways we're kinda evil
Got my roots and you've got ties
But my heart's no stranger to upheaval
Put your little hand in mine and look into my Eyes, baby eyes

Oh, you make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again

Ah, music again
Look into my eyes baby eyes
I just wanna listen to music again

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine and look into my Eyes, baby eyes, whoa

Oh, you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Oh, you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again
