Hey man you alright?
No
I seen how your ol girl was coming down on you
Yeah
What happened? Your pops found out you lost that job and shit
mmm-hmmm
Well donât worry homey, man parent be like that sometimes, itâs like they mad at you because they get old. Just donât go all crazy on me, talking about you going to kill yourself again, alright

Yes, in my mind I want to do it but when I pursue it I canât seem to go through it
So Iâm going to write a song just so you can feel everything I feel when Iâm in the mood to kill myself
I canât control it, these thoughts of suicide, Iâm always dealing with
And I know Iâm not alone when it comes to this, cause everyday itâs like the whole world pissed
So fuck your attitude and keep your bad mood cause I got one too
And I donât give a shit who you rolling with bring your whole damn crew
Weâll call it suicide when you messin with a killa someoneâs bound to die
And it wonât be me cause only oneâs claimin my life is g-o-d

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
You ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide
Glad you didnât do it, if you did you wouldnât be here now

Are you easily influenced,
Does your parents always say that your friends are the reason that you ruint
Do you have hate for your boss, to where you wanna catch him alone and pop one off
Or is it mental health, where the only problem that you have is with yourself
Can someone please explain why it feels so good to cause so much pain
With all these thoughts we have, yep itâs easy to say to just relax
But when you that fed up, only thing in your mind is how deep to cut
Because you hate your life and you really donât care
And things would be better if you just werenât here
So now you ready to go end it all,
Instead of thinking of the ones you wonât see tomorrow

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

<i>[Strict 9]</i>
Itâs nothing nice, got the thoughts steadily running through my head
I close my eyes and try to picture if Iâm better off dead
It sucks to me, the one and only as I sit here by my lonely
Separated from the world cause the world is so phony
Hear my cries, tell me why when you do it tell them lies
You wear a disguise I can see it in your motherfuckin eyes
Itâs suicide, last ride if you wanna get inside
Shotgun itâs your boy and Iâm ready to die

<i>[ABK]</i>
Do people that commit suicide go to heaven?
Iâm sure everyone has their own theories
But Iâm a firm believer that if you take you own life
Your soul is trapped

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
