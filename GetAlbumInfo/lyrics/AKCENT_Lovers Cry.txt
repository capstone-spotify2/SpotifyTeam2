I dream of you
And it feels like I'm flying
I think of you when I'm smiling
I'm lost into your eyes
I sing our song
And it feels like we're dancing
My broken heart can't stop racing
I love but is it wise?

She's born to run away
So sad that she can't stay
I wish she gives me one more day
I kiss my love goodbye
I hold her one last time
And suddenly I do know why
Lovers cry.

Tell me the meaning of being together
If you keep running forever
I don't understand
What is the purpose of loving each other
'Cause every day I keep wonder
If I see you again

She's born to run away
So sad that she can't stay
I wish she gives me one more day
I kiss my love goodbye
I hold her one last time
And suddenly I do know why
Lovers cry

She's born to run away
So sad that she can't stay
I wish she gives me one more day
I kiss my love goodbye
I hold her one last time
And suddenly I do know why
Lovers cry.
