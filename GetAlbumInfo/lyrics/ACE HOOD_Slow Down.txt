Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can't stop (slow down)
Asking me to slow down
In my feeling all caught up now
It's been months since I ain't seen you
Heard thru the vibe you gotta rebound

Now she begging me, she begging me
She ready to do everything
Are you missing me? Well, you'd better be
Let's slow, slow it down

Remember that time we was out in Puerto Rico?
Told me that you love me, it can never be a sequel
Wish I could've paused our love like TiVo
My homie KC, told me that's the way it be though

Her Sex game stupid, head game stupid
I ain't gotta ask, she just do it
Said she da best, I say prove it
We gon slow down the time

Ain't nothing like me you can bet your bottom dolla
Thinking I should call, but I never do bother
Heard you in school, you a fan, you scholar
Heard that I'm doing better now the tricks wanna holla

Celebrity, celebrity
Shinning star so heavily
But damn, I got other things on my mind
You wanna slow down the time

Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can't stop (slow down)
Only call you after 1 o' clock
Your bad money kinda sorta fine
I like your but it's kinda border line
Tryna put them thoughts in my mind
You wanna slow down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down

Okay, I'm cool with a bitch named Sandra Lee
Friends with her twin and they both the beast
Head give mean and they Vietnamese
And they love fucking me, they got the similar dream
Money stay the calling, so I fuck 'em and leave
Waste my time and I'm chuckin' the D
So they beggin' me to just slow down the time

You read on my eye
Girl, do that same thing every time
I like when you're around
But I don't know if I, I don't know if I
Could slow it down, slow it down

My nigga ACE said
He has six girls for us that's three a piece, three a piece
What they hittin' for?
He said nothing they just wanna be down with the crew
I said I'll be on my way
He said they already on goose
I'm a ready on that cush
Already on that 80 proof
Hop off in my coop
I press a button and lose the roof
Now that's drop top
Burn the bread, call it pop tart
When I'm in the mall, the nigga shop a cart
Got a U haul in the parking lot

Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can't stop (slow down)
Only call you after 1 o' clock
Your Bad money kinda sorta fine
I like you but it's kinda border line
Tryna put them thoughts in mind
You wanna slow down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down)
