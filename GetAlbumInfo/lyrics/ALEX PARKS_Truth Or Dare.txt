I watch you sleeping 
You're dreaming again, 
Are you flying? 
Are you falling? 
Are you waiting to be 
Brought out from the dark? 
And as you're sleeping 
Can you feel me? 
Are you watching? (Are you watching?) 

You'll wake up in time, 
Won't you 
You'll wake up in time 
Will you? (Will you?) 

So hold on, 
Don't you even look down 
You know what I've got to say, 
So hold on, 
Don't you dare to be scared, 
A dream is just A truth or dare 

I watch you resting, 
Dreaming slumber stirs, 
Hours of waking, 
Do you remember? 
Were you hoping you would 
Wake up somewhere else? 
And as you rise up 
Do you realise? 
You were dreaming.. 

You'll wake up in time, 
Won't you? 
You'll wake up in time, 
Will you? (Will you?) 

So hold on, 
Don't you even look down 
You know what I've got to say, 
So hold on, 
Don't you dare to be scared, 
A dream is just A truth or dare 

You've 'gotta wake up sleepy, 
You've 'gotta wake up till I come, 
Have another slice 
Before they take you away 
Give some good advice 
While your life goes astray 
Undermine your future 
While your past is the same 

So hold on, 
Don't you even look down 
You know what I've got to say, 
So hold on, 
Don't you dare to be scared, 
A dream is just A truth or dare 
A dream is just A truth or dare 
A dream is just A truth or dare
