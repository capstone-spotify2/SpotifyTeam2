Listen closely can you hear it?
Every tribe and tongue sings out a song
full of hope and full of power
as your people rise and sing along

Though the thunder roll
and the darkness rage
Youâll never change

Our hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus blood and righteousness
We stand on what Youâve done
We stand on what Youâve done
We will not bend we will not break
You are our strength so we will say
Our King has overcome
Our King has overcome the world

So let faith arise as we Your children
place our trust in every word Youâve said
You live in us with all the power
to heal the sick and even raise the dead

We lift our eyes oh weâre not forsaken
Your love remains

Our hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus blood and righteousness
We stand on what Youâve done
We stand on what Youâve done
We will not bend we will not break
You are our strength so we will say
Our King has overcome
Our King has overcome the world

Youâre the great overcomer
Youâre the King of all Kings
Youâre the One who was and whoâll always be
Youâre our source of life
Youâre the breath we breathe
Youâre the reason weâll sing for eternity

Our hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus blood and righteousness
We stand on what Youâve done
We stand on what Youâve done
We will not bend we will not break
You are our strength so we will say
Our King has overcome
Our King has overcome the world

Youâre the great overcomer
Over death, hell and the grave
Youâre the great overcomer
Oh thereâs nothing that You canât save
Youâre the great overcomer
I know, I know, I know
Youâre the great overcomer
