<i>[Hook - David:]</i>
Songbird, its takinâ longer
I see the ego in the people get stronger
Could take a lifetime, to see the right signs
So lets remind every mind were the same,
People past the front line, even past the guns drawn
Worries and our failures, everyone is one kind

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Iâm a part of a motivated movement
Hop up in the FAM if youâre for improvement
Some by the pool, mixing drinks, straight coolinâ
While otherâs are struggling, just to be a student
Uncover the bright side, itâs always time for that
No more running kids with AKâs strapped to back
Iâmma reach my inked out arm to help
Donât think that itâs all gone to hell
Look ahead, look to the future
Sew up them sutures, mend the world
Pick up the loser, put down the uzi
Headlines lined with crime alerts
Some of the sickening things that are happening come from the lack of respect
Itâs all big heads, yeah weâre doing well, pick up the slack and take on whatâs next

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Donât let that ego get in the way
Donât make people think that youâve gone and changed
Iâm a self made man, thatâs right
Still the damn same, but Iâm on the tracks to a louder life
And Iâm fortunate enough to have that income coming in
We hold it down and stay grounded
Some of yâall just hovering and go!
Focus on a mind outside your own
Never change for anyone at all
