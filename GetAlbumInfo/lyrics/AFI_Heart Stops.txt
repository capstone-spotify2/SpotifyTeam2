Oh, my pretty precious stone
Just left me in ribbons
With my heart sliced carefully
You wear it like a cheerful bow

There's a light that you now adore
But the bringer is cast down
I have never been before
So unhappy in my whole life

Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You were my first faith, made of lies like all the others
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
I found my last light but it died like all the others (all the others)

Oh, my painful fatal flaw
May your cruelty find you
May the scars you left in me
Dig into you twice as deep

Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You were my first faith, made of lies like all the others
Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
I found my last light but it died like all the others

I know you'll look away while I'm crying
I know you'll wear that bow with a smile
Everything I gave you, it was wasted
Love further down, adore that denial

I stopped feeling numb, now I have to be
Because I trusted you I cannot trust another
Heart stops beating, what was brutality?
You were my last light so I'll die like all the others

Heart stops beating, beat like a brutal day
You were my first faith, made of lies like all the others, all the others
