<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Anyone in the place tonight you don't wanna be a witness then walk away (Akon!!!) 
Cause I'm a soldier that love to fight and anyone in my path will die today 
By my AK!!! (Gunshot!!!) AK!!! (Gunshot!!!) AK!!! (Gunshot!!!) AK!!! (Gunshot!!!) 

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Have you ever spent one day on my block?! 
Had to make good with crooked ass cops 
Witness innocent bystanders get shot 
Made a livin ready or not 
(To stay true!!!) To all my N****s 
Things gettin hard but we still grindin up

Before the feds came down on we 
True badman nuh counterfeit g's 
Maybe once stick around and trust you will see (That)
