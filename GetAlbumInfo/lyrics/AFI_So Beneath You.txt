I donât believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify my blood.
I donât believe that you are with me.
Itâs so beneath you, gazing up.

I wonât kneel.
I wonât bow.
If youâre there now
Strike me down, strike me down, strike me down
Oh, youâve got nothing.

There is none higher than this blood
And I wonât serve anyone.
No there is nothing above
And I donât serve anyone, anyone.

There's nothing above

Deep in my heart, a disbeliever
Only inviting in the truth.
Youâre in my heart, my disbeliever,
As holy horror crushes you.

I wonât kneel.
I wonât bow.
No one is there to
Strike me down, strike me down, strike me down
Except the faithful.

There is none higher than this blood
And I wonât serve anyone.
No there is nothing above
And I donât serve anyone, anyone.

I donât believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify my blood.
I donât believe that I can stay here
And watch them vilify your love, my love.

I wonât kneel.
I wonât bow.
If youâre there god
Strike me down, strike me down
You wonât

There is none higher than this blood
And I wonât serve anyone.
No there is nothing above
And I donât serve anyone, anyone.

Thereâs nothing above
