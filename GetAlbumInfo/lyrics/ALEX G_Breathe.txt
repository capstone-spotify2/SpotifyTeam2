You were my all, you were my everything.
You needed me like water, you needed me to breathe.
I gave you my heart, I gave you the best of me.
But the closer I became, the less I could see.

Now it stares at me, like my reflection.
It's who I want to be, not who I was.

I want to breathe again, I want to dream again.
Want something beautiful, to make it all meaningful...

I know your pain, and it kills me to break you.
But I'm waking up, and the sky's still blue.
Letting go doesn't always mean you'll fall.
And my storybook is better off with pages still unwritten.

And it stares at me, like my reflection.
Oh the truth you see, it cuts like a blade.

I want to breathe again, I want to dream again.
Want something beautiful, to make it all meaningful.
I want to dare to live, give me the chance to give,
All that I have to life. And all that I am.

And all of the years, we were together, 
Our love was for real. Nothing could measure.
So the hardest part's admitting I'm better without you.
We lost ourselves drowned in illusion, 
and we couldn't see as we sank to the bottom.
But I reached the surface before it could wash me away.

I want to breathe again, I want to dream again.
Want something beautiful, to make it all meaningful.
I want to dare to live, give me the chance to give,
All that I have to life. And all that I am.
