Fourteen dollars and sixteen minutes
Since I looked at you I've been finished
Your tongue is blue from the cotton candy
The sugar high has kept me standing tall-all-all
Your black framed glasses so hipster critic
Sarcastic comebacks and text a minute
But he has got you in his fingers

I wanna feel our first time forever
If this is a dream
I wanna wake up together-gether-gether
Cause I miss you when I close my eyes
Burning in the back of my mind like love on fire
Like love on fire
Like love on fire

From a distance you're so flirtatious a bit
You share secrets like you share playlists
I'm bad at talking about big ambitions
So let's take a dive off this bridge
And let's fall-all-all ohhhh

I wanna feel our first time forever
If this is a dream
I wanna wake up together-gether-gether
Cause I miss you when I close my eyes
Burning in the back of my mind like love on fire
Like love on fire
Like love on fire

Ohh yeah
I wanna feel our first time forever (forever)
If this is a dream (this is a dream)
I wanna wake up (I wanna wake up) together-gether-gether
Cause I miss you when I close my eyes (when I close my eyes)
Burning in the back of my mind (yeah yeah in the back of my mind) like love on fire
Like love on fire
Like love on fire
Like love on fire
Like love on fire
