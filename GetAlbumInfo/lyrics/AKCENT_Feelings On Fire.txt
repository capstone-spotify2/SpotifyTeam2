Hand in hand we'll walk again,
In wind and rain,
There's no way to end
No reason to blame
This feelings on fire!
Me and you,
The perfect view,
It could be true!
We've got love to share,
The passion we ware
The feelings on fire!

<i>[Verse: Ruxandra Bar]</i>
'Cause I'm dreaming I'm dreaming of love and desire,
And I'm meaning I'm meaning like kiss of this night
'Cause you set
My feelings on fire!
'Cause I'm dreaming I'm dreaming of love and desire,
And I'm feeling I'm feeling the heat in the air
'Cause tonight
My love is on fire!
