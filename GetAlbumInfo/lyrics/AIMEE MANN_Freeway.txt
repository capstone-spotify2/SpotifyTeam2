You've got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway
The road to Orange Country leaves an awful lot of leeway
Where everyone's a doctor or a specialist in retail
They'll sell you all the speed you want if you can take the blackmail

You know it
I know it
Why don't you
Just show it
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway

You've got a lot of money but you cannot keep your bills paid
The sacrifice is worth it just to hang around the arcade
You found yourself a prophet but you left him on the boardwalk
Another chocolate Easter bunny, hollowed out by your talk

You know it
I know it
Why don't you
Just show it
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway

And everything I do is wrong
But at least I'm hanging on
You got a lot of money that you can't afford
You got a lot of money that you can't afford
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway
You got a lot of money but you can't afford the freeway
You got a lot of money but you can't afford
You got a lot of money but you can't afford
