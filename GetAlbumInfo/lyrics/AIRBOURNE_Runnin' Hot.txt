The pistons are pumping and the wheels are turning
The motor is getting hot, The fuel is burning
Your looking up here at a well oiled machine
No red light the whole thing's green
And we're never gonna stop
No we're never gonna stop
No we're never gonna stop
No we're never gonna stop
From Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot

And the wheels are turning
And the fires are burning
And we're never gonna stop
Stop the clock

I can feel the sweat upon my brow
And adrenalin is pumping through out
We never will stop 'til we get to the top
And If I'm gonna die trying then I'll give it all I got
And we're never gona stop
No we're never gona stop
No we're never gona stop
No we're never gonna stop
From Runnin' Hot

Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot

And the wheels are turning
And the fires are burning
And we're never gonna stop
Warp speed Mr Sulu

Runnin' hot, Runnin' hot, Never gonna stop
No way, Never gonna stop
Runnin' hot, Runnin' hot, Never gonna stop
No way, Never gonna stop
Runnin' hot, Runnin' hot, Never gonna stop
No way, Never gonna stop
Runnin' hot, Runnin' hot, Never gonna stop
No way, Never gonna stop.
No, Never gonna stop!
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
No never gonna stop
Fire for effect!

And the wheels are turning
And the fires are burning
And we're never gonna stop, Stop the clock

Runnin' Hot
Runnin' Hot
