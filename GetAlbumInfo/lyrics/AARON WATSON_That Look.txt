She keeps it all together, I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected, I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning, I'm a dance hall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window, I'm a Lonestar neon light

She has another side that no one sees but me
She is the only one that brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra and a bottle of chardonnay
Without a single word she takes my breath away

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always looking so fine that I can't believe mine
And when those stars align just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girls' off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

She sparkles like a diamond she twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine that always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze that soothes my weary soul

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always looking so fine that I can't believe mine
And when those stars align just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girls' off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

Slow dancin', romancin'
She's up to something wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always looking so fine that I can't believe mine
And when those stars align just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girls' off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

There's something about Sinatra and a bottle of chardonnay
Without a single word she takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning, I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window, I'm a neon light
