<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I'm just a thug, on the other side of the law
Raised in the hood, never thought I'd make it this far
I went from standing on the block
Dealing, toting my glock, weighing product on a triple-beam
I even got hassled a lot
Mainly by crooked cops
Life wasn't as easy as it seems

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Gets harder everyday
To come up with the rent and ain't got a job
Trying to keep the bills paid
But don't wanna get locked up no more
See, my parole officer almost caught me with that stuff
Tossed it so he wouldn't find a trace
Not to mention my baby momma, the bitch is greedy as fuck
Got child support steady on my case

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Got a little personal, but let me break it down
I'm not the only one out here going through it now
It's international, recessions all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know you heard it, and work it
Don't give up it'll all work out
Can't never stop hoping, for certain
I be grinding until the day that I die

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind <i>[x3]</i>)
