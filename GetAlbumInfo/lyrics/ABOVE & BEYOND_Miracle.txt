Donât they know that thereâs something going on?
What theyâre harming with their indecision
But who will be left standing when Iâm gone?
Thereâll be nothing left but a vision

Itâs too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
Itâs too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
This is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
Thereâs a price weâll have to pay

Don't they know that there's
Something they can do?
To be sure of tomorrow's tomorrow
And too late is too late for me and you
No more time left for you to borrow

And itâs too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
Itâs too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
And this is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
Thereâs a price weâll have to pay
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
