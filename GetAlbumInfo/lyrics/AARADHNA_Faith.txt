<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I Can Feel It 
I Can Feel Myself Moving
Closer To A Dream Thats Waiting For Me
I Know That Ill Come Across A Bumpy Path But Ill Get Through It <i>[X2]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I Can Fly High
And I Can Swim Right Under The Ocean
Anythings Mine
If I Have Faith I Kno I Can Do It
I Will Get By
If I Work Towards All My Dreams
Suns Gonna Shine
If I Have Faith I Know I Can Make It

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Life's Not Ment To Be Safe
Ain't No Hard Work Goes Unrewarded I'm Sure
I Am Willin, I Am Able I'm Ready
For Watever That May Come My Way

Theres No Doubt That I Will Get There I'm Certain

Nothings Imposible
With Dedication, Motivation Desperation
We Were All Born To Shine 
And Right Nows My Time
To Give Out A Little Light
Of My Own
And Shine It On The World

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I Can Fly High
And I Can Swim Right Under The Ocean
Anythings Mine
If I Have Faith I Kno I Can Do It
I Will Get By
If I Work Towards All My Dreams
Suns Gonna Shine
If I Have Faith I Know I Can Make It

All I Need Is Faith
All I Need Is Faith
All I Need Is Faith
All I Need Is Faith

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I Can Fly High
And I Can Swim Right Under The Ocean
Anythings Mine
If I Have Faith I Kno I Can Do It
I Will Get By
If I Work Towards All My Dreams
Suns Gonna Shine
If I Have Faith I Know I Can Make It
