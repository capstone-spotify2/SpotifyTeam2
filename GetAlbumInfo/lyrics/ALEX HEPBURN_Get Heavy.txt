This ain't fictional my mama said the army should've raised me
A low down problem child naked ass and running wild she'd chase me
Don't you try and change my mind you will find that you will your time
Say goodbye to what you know say hello to what you don't like

If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get if you wanna get if you
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy (Let's go)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy heavy heavy heavy

Just before I turned fifteen was sipping gin and someking green do you blame me
Education sit on that went in the front straight out the back they'd chase me
Don't you try and change my mind you will find that you will waste your time
Say goodbye to what you know say hello to what you don't like

If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get if you wanna get if you
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy (Let's go)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy heavy heavy heavy

This ain't fictional
Mama bring the army on
I don't care at all I'll take anybody on
Strangers stop and smile
You ain't gonna tame that child
She's crazy crazy

If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
If you wanna get if you wanna get if you
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy (Let's go)
If you wanna get heavy (Let's go I'm ready)
Get heavy heavy heavy heavy
