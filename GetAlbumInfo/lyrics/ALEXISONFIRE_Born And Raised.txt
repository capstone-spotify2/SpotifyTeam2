All blossoms die in the light of our new culture
Find your belief in that which cannot be discovered
Countless lessons lie in every fever dream
A million voices asking, what does it all mean?

Iâve lost all direction
Iâve lost all my direction
And now I wish, that I would have believed
Could have believed

Escape, escape
Natureâs indifferent hand
Retreat, retreat
To the bliss of our creation

We were born and raised
To live beyond
The heft and weight of a world undone
Like a bird from the north
Our hearts will roam in search of warmth

Two hands come together to pray for greater yields
Two poles of a compass guided by a field
In the mind of every man, two ghosts dance
Was this place made, or was it here by chance?
Iâve lost all direction
Iâve lost all my direction
And now I wish, that I would have believed
Could have believed

Escape, escape
Natureâs indifferent hand
Retreat, retreat
To the bliss of our creation

We were born and raised
To live beyond
The heft and weight of a world undone
Like a bird from the north
Our hearts will roam in search of warmth

Uncountable numbers written in new fallen snow
I can hear the claws of the beast tapping at my window
Nihilist sleeps and in dreams he sees godâs face
Realize even disbelief requires a leap of faith
From birth to death, we search for whatâs yet to be known
We and hope and pray and ask, but we are never shown

Born and raised to live beyond
The heft and weight of a world undone
Like a bird from the north
Our hearts will roam in search of warmth

We were born and raised
