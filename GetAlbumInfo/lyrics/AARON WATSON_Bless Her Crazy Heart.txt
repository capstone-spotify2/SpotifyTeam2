O, lord save my soul
I like to get a little loud
Goes without saying I suppose
I've got this thing for old guitars
Honky Tonkin' bars and my honey suckle rose
Cuz she's as sweet as she can be
She keeps me coming back around, and around
Seems I'm always on the fly
When that ramblin' fever rises high
She brings my temperature back down
She always does

I'd be an out of control, wild, and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart

I'm like a full time job
Sometimes a household chore
I wonder when she said I do
If she truly ever knew
What our future had in store
Somehow she still believes in me
Through all my many winds of change
Some have faith it will move a mountain
Lord she's got the kind that will move the mountain range
She always moves me

I'd be an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart

I'd be an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart

A love like this is like a slow train
I'm bound to crash and burn, derail, twist and turn
My life is borderline insane

I'd been an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
Without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
