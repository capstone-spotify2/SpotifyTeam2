Now first of all I gotta warn you.
Before you fall in love with me. 
This here kickinâ out the footlights ainât all its cracked up to be. 
Well, cheap hotels and truck stop coffee its what makes the wheels go round.
I know exactly what your thinkinâ girl.
God only knows if Iâll ever settle down.

So if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ainât easy holdinâ on to hard livinâ, honky tonkin, Texas boys.

Just ask the women who have been there.
Whoâve lived and breathed that crazy life.
Ask sweet Jessie about olâ Wayland. 
Ask olâ Willieâs four ex-wives.
Some day your gonna want a family.
Some day you may be wantinâ more.
In a king size bed thatâs always lonely.
Whenever I walk out your door.

But if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ainât easy holdinâ on to hard livinâ, honky tonkin, Texas boys.

Thereâs something about them neon signs.
Iâm like a moth drawn to a flame.
Blame it on a smoky bar or a cryinâ steel guitar.
Those pretty girls screaminâ my name.

So if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ainât easy holdinâ on to hard livinâ, honky tonkin, Texas boys.
