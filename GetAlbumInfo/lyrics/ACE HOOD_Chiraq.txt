Beast, beast, HA!
My money late, it's no explanation
No conversation, just confrontation
They never safe, it's no combination
That chopper handy, your accommodations
I'm beast mode, and my new flow is like C4 and that's abomination
I'm dedicated, I'm levitated, this shit I'm smoking, they medicated
Shoot pussy niggas, ya'll never try me
Ya'll mama then would be devastated
Running round with them young niggas
Them 30 pistols ain't registrated
They rob niggas and love beef
They sneeking out when they mom sleep
They switching whips and they bustin' licks
And they love the ride to that Chief Keef
I'm back up on to my bullshit, fresh up off of that pulpit
Say a prayer for the Naysayers, y'all better know who y'all fuckin with
Get in line for that summer time cause this summer's mine, you better recognize
Bad bitches on big yachts and they do whatever, that's for the Vine
These hoes be gassing niggas, now all of a sudden they talking crazy
Niggas thugging on Internets until we on they corner like Champ Bailey
Instagramming I don't give a damn when they blocka blam and they can't save'em
All I heard was "oh Lord, Jesus they still pleading that poor baby"
Illest, you know what, I'm switching the flow
They see the glow when I walk through the door
Money the motive I'm whipping the Lotust
I'm more than unfocused, you know it for sho'
I body whatever
Beast nigga
Rappers on my plate, now that's a feast nigga
That's a feast nigga
Rappers on my plate, now that's a feast niggas
Now that's a feast nigga, rappers on my plate, now that's a feast nigga
Ain't no games, my new shit is on the way
See y'all niggas better tighten up cause we <i>[?]</i> out a few days away
