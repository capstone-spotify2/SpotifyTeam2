Can I have your attention
Ladies and gentlemen
We are honored
To have among us
Someone special tonight.

Let's hear it for the girl
Who made one man's dream come true
Let's hear it for the girl
Darling hears to you.
For the good and bad
For everything that we have had, together
Here's to the rest of forever with you.

Don't stand there so shy
Come on, please, don't cry
I just gotta tell
I just gotta tell the world about you
So wipe those tears and take a bow.

Let's hear it for the girl
Who made one man's dream come true
Let's hear it for the girl
Darling hears to you
For the good and bad
For everything that we have had, together
Now, here's to the rest of forever with you, with you.

Let's hear it for the girl
Who made one man's dream come true
Let's hear it for the girl
Darling, here's to you
For the good and bad
For everything that we have had, together
Hears to the rest of forever with you.

<i>[Instrumental &amp; vocalizations]</i>

I just gotta tell the world about you.

Let's hear it for the girl (for the girl)
Who made one man's dream come true
Let's hear it for the girl
Darling hears to you
For the good and bad
For everything that we have had, together
Well, hears to the rest of forever with you, with you.

With you...
