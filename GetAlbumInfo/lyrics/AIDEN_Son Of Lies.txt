Son of lies, son of lies inside my heart.
Whoa, Whoa.
Son of lies, you're the son of lies tear us apart.
Whoa, Whoa.

Sing my darling crystalline.
And shine so bright we all go blind.
Stay a million words to say.
And show until we all go home.

The world.
Won't last.
Don't bring me back.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.
Destroy me

Look at my fucking heart you took. 
And cold these days it grows like stone.

The world.
Won't last.
Don't bring me back.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.
Destroy me.

We're forming! We're forming!
Infect the living to the end. To the end.
We're forming! We're forming!

Son of lies, son of lies inside my heart.
Whoa, Whoa.
Son of lies, you're the son of lies tear us apart.
Whoa, Whoa.


The world.
Won't last.
Don't bring me back.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.

So rise (Rise) kill a lifetime in disguise.
(Tonight, tonight)
You're the son of lies.
