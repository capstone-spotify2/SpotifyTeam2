The skyline changes, and so do I
Let my nightmares die, so my dreams can fly
Dream like I'm ageless, live like I might die
Love like my heart loves me, and my mind might lie
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline changes, and so do I
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline changes, and so do I

I'll never try to paint your picture
I'm meant to expanding your canvas
And to confiding to a mic
Where conversations can't manage
Never hiding behind lies
Hittin' the front lines
And let the truth do damage
Inject it with soul
Givin' food for thought
For those whose thoughts feel famished
The universe don't revolve around you
Yeah, ancestors really didn't have a clue
But at the same time you create your universe
Treat it as a gift or treat it as a curse
We are the artist, you paint what we believe
Choose not to use all the paints on the pallet, are you free?
Dream big, think bigger, make a difference
I hit the city so I could pursue this as my mission
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline changes, and so do I
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline
('Cause the skyline)
'Cause the skyline changes, and so do I
