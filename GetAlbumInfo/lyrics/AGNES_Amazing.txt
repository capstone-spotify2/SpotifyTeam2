Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah
I want you to feel me
Speak louder, let somebody hear your voice!
I need you, ready...
Get ready, take a breath and let it out!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(It's amazing) when dreams come to life,
When you're dancing to life
It's amazing!
When you live from the heart!
(It's amazing) when you touch the skies,
Spread your wings up, fly
It's amazing when you reach for the stars!
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

No matter what you go through
No matter where you've been before
Do you know why you're waiting
Are you afraid to fall?
One moment, one crossroad
If you never take a chance
How will you know, how will you know?
Yeah, yeah!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(It's amazing) when dreams come to life,
When you're dancing to life
It's amazing!
When you live from the heart!
(It's amazing) when you touch the skies,
Spread your wings up, fly
It's amazing when you reach for the stars!
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When dreams come to life, and dreams come to life
Uh, uh, when the dreams come to life!
When dreams come to life, and dreams come to life
When dreams come to life, and dreams come to life
When dreams come to life, and dreams come to life

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(It's amazing) when dreams come to life,
When you're dancing to life
It's amazing!
When you live from the heart!
(It's amazing) when you touch the skies,
Spread your wings up, fly
It's amazing when you reach for the stars!
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
