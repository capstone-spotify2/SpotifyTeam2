I knew I should have savored every moment
I wish I would have grabbed it tight and just hold it

I know, I know everything's wrong
Let go, let go, now I'm gone

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know, you know
You can get out
I know I should have cherished every second
I step back, step back to another perspective
And in my mind, my mind I know I've been wrong
It's a feeling you've got, you're feeling so cold

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out 

I don't want to feel like this will never be over
And I don't want to sit and think about what's going wrong
I don't want to feel like this will never be over
Cause it feels like I've been falling for so damn long

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out

(All falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out)

I don't want to feel like this will never be over
When it all falls down
