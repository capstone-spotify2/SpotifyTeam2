Search my heart, search my mind
Search my soul
Make me clean, make me new
Make me whole

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design

'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me

You are my strength, You are my God
You are my King
You make me laugh, You make me dance
You make me sing

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design

'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me

Everything inside, everything outside
I give it all away
You never change but You rearrange
My heart more everyday

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design

'Cause You are the one
Who can make my life complete
You are the one
Who can give light to my feet

You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away

You  gave it all away for me
You  gave it all away for me
Search my heart, search my mind
Search my soul
