There's a chance you will be there
I'd like to know the truth
I'll find it out somehow
The chances aren't too strong
A chance you will be there
Please be there alone
Help me speak of love
Chances aren't enough
One's too good to miss
Chances aren't too strong
A chance is all there is

There's a chance you will be there
Wond'ring what to do
How to play my role
I'll leave it up to you
If I disguise my smile
It gives too much away
And what if we can't speak
What then shall I say
Don't you be too long
Something has gone wrong
The chances are all gone
