This is how itâs bout to go down, believe it or not, Iâm still here
All you haters, time to shed another tear
Because Iâm back in this bitch like your momâs ex boyfriend
All up in your face with some brand new nonsense
Diss if you want to, go ahead and take a shot
Sooner or later that shit goin be squashed
Iâm a killa with an attitude road ragin like a fool
Rolling with a family the size of a typhoon

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
We ainât going away
We ainât going away (nowhere)
We ainât going away
We ainât going away (far from reality)

Who you think you fucking with? This shit getting serious
Ainât no time for busted lips, the shit I bust will turn you bitch
Turn your back and walk away, keep on thinking that you safe
Itâs a small world after all, so Iâll just wait until that day
To pull my heat and lay you out or grab my blade and start to scalp
Either way I do not doubt the sweet revenge keeps me around
Silently right on your trail, if you live only time will tell
Iâll be there though if you ainât, so you can see we here to stay

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

All my warriors get loud; make some room up in this crowd
Let everyone else around; see how killers put shit down
Pull it out and let it pop, listen to those bodies drop
Let them all lay their in shock, at least now they know we donât play
Everybody recognize Iâm not the type to tell you twice
Fuck with me, I guarantee that someone going pay the price
Show respect when in the room, Iâm killing all that I see though
If you ever did me wrong, then I hope to see you soon

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
