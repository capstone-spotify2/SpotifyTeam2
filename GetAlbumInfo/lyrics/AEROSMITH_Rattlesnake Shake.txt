We thankyou kindly
Right now we'd like to do a song
Ain't necessarily our own, but it could very well be
It's a song about self abuse
It's called...Rattlesnake Shake

Well, if you wanna rock
I got to be your rockin' horse
And if you wanna roll
Lord, I could blow you right out the door
Yes I could
We'll shake the world
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight
Lord, I guess I got to shake myself
A looky here

You need some lovin'
You must have the blues
You fought your mind baby
Hey that's a good thing to do
Now do the shake
The Rattlesnake Shake
Now do the, do the shake
Yes, chuck away them blues...chuck your blues

Yeah...you need some lovin'
You must have blues
You fought with your mind, baby
That's a good thing thing......to do
Do the shake
Oh...The Rattlesnake Shake...oh
Now...do the shake
Yeah...Chuck away...
