You could be from Venus 
I could be from Mars 
We would be together 
Lovers forever 
Care for each other 

You could live in the sea 
And I could be a bird 
We would be together 
Lovers forever 
Care for each other 

If you wear an illusion 
I will make it real 
We would be together 
Lovers forever 
Care for each other 

If you walk in the sun 
I will be your shadow 
We would be together 
Lovers forever 
Care for each other
