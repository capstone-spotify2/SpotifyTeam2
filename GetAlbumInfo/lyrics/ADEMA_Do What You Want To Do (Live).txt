Where will we go? <i>[x2]</i>

Sign away all of my decisions
Tell when I breed
Terminate opinions
I dream away my freedom to please you
Let them talk so they feel important
They don't mean a thing
This is my own dream
Why do you have to put this on me

(Where will we go?) - I'm a mess <i>[x2]</i>

Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want

Life's okay, so don't complain
You can't obtain
Figure out how to maintain
It's a shame, make a change
So life will never ever find me down
Found out just what it's really all about
Never doubt, I wish I could get out
Why do you have to put this on me?

(Where will we go?) - I'm a mess <i>[x2]</i>

Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want

Find a way

(Where will we go?) - I'm a mess <i>[x2]</i>

Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
