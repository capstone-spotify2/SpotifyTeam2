If I die I'll go to Heaven
Because I spent my time in Hell
Never claimed to know the answers
But I've faked it pretty well

And I've walked straight through the valley
Full of shadows and of death
Never claimed to know the answers
And I've learned a lot of lessons
But it hasn't killed me yet
But they haven't killed me yet

I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same
And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same

Now somewhere in my darkness
Now I've heard so many stories
There shined a little light
Full of sadness and regret
A chance for me to be forgiven
And I've learned a lot of answers
But I couldn't get it right
To the things I didn't get

I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same
And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same

I lost it all

So if I die I'll go the Heaven
Because I spent my time in Hell
Never claimed to know the answers
But I've faked it pretty well

I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same
And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same

I lost it all
I lost it all
