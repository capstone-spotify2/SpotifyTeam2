Your face when I try to explain
I didn't think you'd take it personally
I'm not saying every word in every line
Goes from the moment lost in time

You should know me better than that
If you wanted to leave I wouldn't look back
Guess what I'm really trying to say
Is I wouldn't paint this picture any other way

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you feel bad I didn't mean it to
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
So I shouldn't be

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you unsure, don't listen anymore
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
And it's clear to see
Show me what's good for you
Cos you're good for me

Somehow you take the easy way out
Is it better to sing or do we have to shout?
This time when you look in my eyes
We can build on the truth, not secrets and lies

You should know me better than that
If I wanted to leave I wouldn't look back
Guess what I'm really trying to say
Is I wouldn't paint this picture any other way

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you feel bad I didn't mean it to
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
So I shouldn't be

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you unsure, don't listen anymore
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
And it's clear to see
Show me what's good for you
Cos you're good for me

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you feel bad I didn't mean it to
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
So I shouldn't be

I'm sorry I wrote this song for you
If it makes you unsure, don't listen anymore
Honesty as a policy
Doesn't work for you
And it's clear to see
Show me what's good for you
Cos you're good for me
