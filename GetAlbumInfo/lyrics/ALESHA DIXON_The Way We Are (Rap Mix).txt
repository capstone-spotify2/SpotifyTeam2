Every move we make, call it a mistake
Looking at a wall like a prisoner in chains
Tell us that we're wrong, tell us what we want
Throw us in an ocean that I know we don't belong

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt, love is so
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are

Who we gonna be?
Nobody can tell
But you're tryna' buy the script on me, that's made for someone else
Changing up the rules, rules I gotta break
For that time that's inside of me
Will always be a faith

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt, love is so
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are

Show them your light
Don't turn them down
It's not their right to come and criticize
Show them your light
It's a miracle
Love is so, just the way we are

Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are
All I'm asking is you to love that
Just the way we are
