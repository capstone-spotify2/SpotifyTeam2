My house, my role 
My friends, my man 
My devotion to god 
All the more feels indefinite 

Nothing's been clear 
Nothing's been in 
Nothing's felt true 
And I've never had both feet in 
Nothing's belonged 
Nothing's been yes 
Nowhere's been home 
And I'm ready to be limbo no more 

My taste, my peers 
My identity, my affiliation 
All the more feels indefinite 

Nothing's been clear 
Nothing's been in 
Nothing's felt true 
And i've never had both feet in 
Nothing's belonged 
Nothing's been yes 
Nowhere's been home 
And I'm ready to be limbo no more 

I sit with filled frames 
And my books and my dogs at my feet 
My friends by my side 
My past in a heap 
Thrown out most of my things 
Only kept what I need to carve 
Something consistent and notably me 

Tattoo on my skin 
My teacher's in heart 
My house is a home 
Something at last i can feel a part of 
Sense of myself 
My purpose is clear 
My roots in the ground 
Something at last I can feel a part of 
Something aligned 
To finally commit 
Somewhere I belong 
Cuz I'm ready to be limbo no more 
My wisdom applied 
A firm foundation 
A vow to myself 
'Cuz I'm ready to be limbo no more
