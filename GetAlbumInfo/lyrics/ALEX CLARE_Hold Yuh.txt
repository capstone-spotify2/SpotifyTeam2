Girl I just want to hold you
Build my world right around you
Cause girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life

Girl I just wanna squeeze you
Build my world right around you
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life

Dry your eyes I can't
See I take you anytime anywhere
When you're scared or full of fear
As a man I will be there

I want a girl who can grow with me
I want a girl who can take care of me
Could you be it, let me see it
Girl could you really be it

Girl I just want to hold you
Build my world right around you
Cause girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life

Girl I just wanna squeeze you
Build my arms right around you
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life

Life past me by too fast to recall
Never felt this good before
Cause you're like a drug without you I'm in withdraw
You always leave me wanting more

She's a fire in my soul
That's, burning out of control
More and more and still I go
Just let this feeling multiply more

Cause I wanna just hold you
Build my world right around you
Girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life

Girl I just wanna squeeze you
Build my arms right around you
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold
I've ever felt in my life
