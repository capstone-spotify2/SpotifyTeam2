She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down

She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She caught me runnin' around
She was dancin' in the ashes
When they caught her with them matches
She's burnin' the honky tonks down

Well she's burnin' the honky tonks down
I tried but I could not put them out
Did the best to save the whiskey
But the flame's just too risky
She's burnin' the honky tonks down

She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She couldn't stop that honky tonk sound
It was sizzlin' like a griddle
When I ran out with my fiddle
She's burnin' the honky tonks down

She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's down in the jailhouse now
Said she felt no remorse
For breakin' out that torch

She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been a rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
