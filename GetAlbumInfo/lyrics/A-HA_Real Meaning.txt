Donât change me
Iâm gonna break if you try

Donât change you
You know the tears
Iâm gonna cry

And I sure will
Miss us when weâre gone

Youâre the real meaning of the sun
It shows you off to everyone
Youâre the real meaning of the sun
It shows you off to everyone
The real meaning
I want the real meaning

Donât fix me
It breaks my heart
To see you try

Donât fix you
And leave me for
Some other guy

And I sure will
Miss us when weâre done

Youâre the real meaning of the sun
It shows you off to everyone
Youâre the real meaning of the sun
It shows you off to everyone

When Iâm thinking about you fondly
Then Iâm thinking about the only
Real meaning of the sun

Youâre the real meaning of the sun
It shows you off to everyone
Youâre the real meaning of the stars
They guide me to the places you are
The real meaning
I want the real meaning
