I don't remember
A word you said
But that November
I can't forget
Intoxicated in every way
There's something about you
My friends are saying
I'm not the same
I try to fight it
But I can't get away
Look at me now
Spinning up and down losing my ground
What is it about you
I got you under my skin
Would you mind spending time
You got me under your spell
Got me good can't you tell
I wanna feel this forever
I'll try and fight it but no one else would do
I wanna do this together
Like you should
You got me good
You got me good
Maybe I shouldn't
You say you can't
It's complicated
But you don't understand
I'm losing my mind
Every time
Every time it's always about you
I got you under my skin
Would you mind spending time
You got me under your spell
Got me good can't you tell
I wanna feel this forever
I'll try and fight it but no one else would do
I wanna do this together
Like you should
You got me good
You got me good
