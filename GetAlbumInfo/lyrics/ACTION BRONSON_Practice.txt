<i>[Allen Iverson Snippet:]</i>
I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice. I mean, listen, we talkin' about practice. Not a game, not a game, not a game, we talkin' about practice

<i>[Intro:]</i>
It's motherfucking me
When I'm up real late, and you know what I'm doing
Bam Bam Bronsolino is tuned into the one and only Peter Rosenberg
Real late on Hot 97, man, get it together

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Thirty thousand for the DNA swab, don't quit your day job
You batty boys ain't even on my radar
Order breasts of veal at Walt Frazier's
Dog, my women come in all flavors, fold paper, Lord save us
Complete a drug deal in a rental rented from AVIS
Best believe my motherfucking Timberlands pounding the pavement
Dog, I lay with hoes, I smoke butter the same color as Jalen Rose
Stand on the balcony naked, just screaming, "Fuck it, I made it!"
Every meal I eat steak to make a statement
Patrick Bateman, thirty Mexicans in the basement, let's get it shaking
The whole block's smelling like bacon
My shorty keep it real, take a shit out the car window
Hide money in a Nintendo
Got a degree in dental
Cook like she down in the delta
Wrestled the gator for the foot display
River monsters, Dog the Bounty Hunter
Open bally stuntin', this is Southern Cali summer, bitch

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
It be the novelist, bare-handed choke a hippopotamus
I need to go to Drug-Dealing Anonymous
Cheerio ship-flip like Rey Mysterio
Me laid up with big money be the scenario
Out the watch flew a canary, it's cuckoo
Let my man who just came home throw a party where you poo-poo
Uh, that is not a nice thought
Get locked up in the afternoon, I make it out by Night Court
Long as I don't see that world
I got the lawyer on retainer like a teenage girl
Eating chicken parmesean in the holding cell
My feet up, hittin' my G-Pen, yeah, you know me well
Quadruple-black coupe, smacks for if you act stupid
No love here, motherfuckers, I clap Cupid, jump in the black Buick
Then make a sharp right
My mother wrist is so cut, look like a shark bite
And when I play the guitar, I'm always on acid
She said I look like David Justice when she see me floating in the Maxima
It's me
