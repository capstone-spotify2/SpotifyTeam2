I start up in the north I grow from special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility 
from French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting until my engine's full

Then I move across the sea
To European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home 
I kiss my mother's mother
look to the horizon

wide eyed, new ground 
humbled by my new surroundings

I am a citizen of the planet
My president is kwan yin
My frontier is on an airplane
my prisons: homes for rehabilitating

Then I fly back to my nest, I fly back with my nuclear but everything is different
So I wait, my yearn for home is broadened, patriotism expanded by callings from beyond
So I pack my things nothing precious all things sacred

I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin

I am a citizen of the planet
democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals fill with every parent

And so, the next few years are blurry, the next decade's a flurry of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric through fields of every color one culture to another

I come alive and I get giddy I am taken and globally naturalized
I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high vision
I am guarded by the angels
My body guides the direction I go in

I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime edge stretching
Besotten with human condition
these ideals are borne from my deepest within
