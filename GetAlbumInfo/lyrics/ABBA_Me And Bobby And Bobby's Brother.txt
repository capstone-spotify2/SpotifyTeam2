Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days

I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost every day
I wanted to
Though we quarrelled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
To have enough fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories, those were my happiest days

They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud to be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
To have enough fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories, those were my happiest days

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)
