I got something cookin'
And I'm boilin' way down deep
While I'm hot and bothered
Why don't you give me what I need
Your kind of lovin' really hits the spot
The things you're doin', baby,
Make me want what you got

So get it, get it,
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot

So get it, get it,
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot

Well, standin' here beside you,
I can really feel the heat
I feel your body tremblin;
From your head down to your feet
I know my mind is in it,
But my body's almost shot
If you want my lovin', babe,
Better get it while it's hot

Yeah get it, get it,
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot

Get it, get it, get it while it's hot
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot.

Yeah get it, get it,
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot.
