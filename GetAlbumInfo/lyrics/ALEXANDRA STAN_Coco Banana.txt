Give me something sexy for the gyal
Give me something smooth for the gyal
DJ, what time is it?

Baby girl, come let it out
Get yourself another round
Show them what it's all about
Win the crowd, win, win the crowd
Mojitos on the rocks
Shake your goodies on the floor
Make some waves, lose control
Rock the boat, rock, rock, rock the boat

We lift some tequila
Sex on la playa
But don't tell my mama
'Bout the coco banana

Coco banana
'Bout the coco banana
Coco banana

Ay, enjoy yourself
All night, party all night

Spend the money for my rent
I'll be sleeping in a tent
Got my lover Instagrammed
Here's a 10, oh boy, here's a 10
Mini skirt and red lips
Club and tickets on the rest
Me and my girls, we murderers
Killing, k-k-killing it

We lift some tequila
Sex on la playa
But don't tell my mama
'Bout the coco banana

Coco banana
'Bout the coco banana
Coco banana

DJ, what time is it?

Don't tell my mama
'Bout the coco banana

Coco banana
'Bout the coco banana
Coco banana
