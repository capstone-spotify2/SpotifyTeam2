first time i saw you girl you lit up the room
but how was i supposed to know
beyond the way that your smile caught my eye
you had something deeper to show
but the power of this emotion has revealed
love is more than what i see, it's what i feel
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
it's in the way you can make me laugh
and in how you believe in me
how you follow your heart no matter what the path
and how you give so unselfishly
oh, now i'm seeing colours, where there once was only grey
now i know the kind of love that takes my breath away
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
yeah...
well, the most amazing thing by far
is you don't even know how beautiful you are
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
well, i'd seen so many things, amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
darlin' you are, what beautiful is
what beautiful is
