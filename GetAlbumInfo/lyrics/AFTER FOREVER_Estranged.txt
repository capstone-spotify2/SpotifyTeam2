Diving in the lake of thousand faces
Every sign seems a delusion 
And fills me with doubt
I shouldn't look for certainty 
Among these disorderly impressions
But still I do...

Being estranged
Slowly I loose the grip on the reality
Time shall shatter what we have built up
Being estranged
From the reliable
Don't even recognize the warmth 
You always fulfilled me with

Break through my crystallized sphere and hold me
Enter my deepest inner self

Imprison the pain
Besieging in vain

It feels like I'm in the middle of a movie
Gazing at the script 
It shows me new insights
Delighted by the bygone sufferings 
But already waiting for the next ones

I bend forward and look between the ripples of the lake
It's the leading character...

Break through my crystallized sphere and hold me
Wherever you are

Deceitful memories mingled with reality
I hold myself to the timeless spell
Fascinated by never knowing if it really happened
