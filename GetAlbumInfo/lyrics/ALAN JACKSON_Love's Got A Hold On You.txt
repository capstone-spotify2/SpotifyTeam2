I called my doctor on the telephone
"Help me doctor, there's something wrong
I can't shake it, it's gone too far"
He said, "Tell me what your symptoms are"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I said "My hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
I can't eat and I can't sleep
It's turning me every way but loose"
He said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
No doubt, love's got a hold on you"

I told my buddies I was settling down
No more of this running 'round
They looked at me like I was a fool
And said "Come on tell us what's wrong with you"

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Well I tossed and turned 'til the morning light
Holding my pillow hanging on for life
There ain't nothing I can do
They said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you"

<i>[Chorus]</i>
