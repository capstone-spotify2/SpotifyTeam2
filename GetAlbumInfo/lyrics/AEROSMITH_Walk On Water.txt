High class 
Moolah 
Bolt ons 
Fast car 
Quick fix 
Freak out...hea hea 
Nose bleed 
Skull cap 
Pissed off 
Pissed on 

I never seen a smile that looked so sad 
A yeah...you make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Hey little darlin' 
Your love is legendary 
Love's four letters 
Ain't in my dictionary 
'Scuse my position 
But it ain't missionary 
Yeah but I want to 
Walk on the water with you...yeah 

Boo-tay 
Hotpants 
Tan line 
Sweet stuff 
Hookah 
Boo yah 
Knocked Up 
Hose Down 
Cool cat 
Hot flash 

When it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype...ha ha 
'Cause I practice on a peach most every night 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Well, the cook's in the kitchen 
And hidin' the spoons 
I'm winkin' at witches 
And howlin' at moons 
I'm afraid of de candle 
But live for de flame 
You know who I am 
But you don't know my name 

(Aha, ha, ha, ha) 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Hey little darlin' 
Your love is legendary 
You got the boo yah 
It's almost ficitonary 
'Scuse my position 
But it ain't missionary 
Yeah, but I want to 
Walk on the water with you...yeah...
