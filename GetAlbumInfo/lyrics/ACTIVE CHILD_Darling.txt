Darling, how have you been?
I know the road is long
But with patience you will find
A new strength and peace of mind
Darling, how have you been?
I know the road is long
But with patience you will find
A new strength and peace of mind

Want it so bad that you cannot let this love
I never learned
Want it so bad that you cannot let this love
I never learned

Darling, how long's it been?
The days stretch on so long
And I know this will take time
But right now I just want to die

Want it so bad, I cannot let this love
I guess I never learned
Want it so bad, I cannot let this love
I guess I never learned how to love, how to love
I guess I never learned how to love
I never learned how to love
I guess I never learned
