Walking down town like a fallen urban angel
Every street could be home, it's plain to see
Mama said trust yourself long before you trust a stranger
But she's a long way from home, her destiny

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All this love, all this love, all this love
Do me right, do me wrong,
Do me in, you should know, that I'll be okay
(All this love)
Like a drug I'm not wasting away, if you wonder, I'll be okay
(All this love)
She said I wanna live, I don't wanna die young
I'm a live through the night, just to light up the sun
I don't need to hide, I don't need to run.

All this love
All this love

Been a long day, been a long night in the city
How does it feel to sleep out in the cold?
Mama said don't be scared, even in the face of danger
I don't need much, I got all I need to owe.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All this love, all this love, all this love
Do me right, do me wrong,
Do me in, you should know, that I'll be okay
(All this love)
Like a drug I'm no wasting away, if you wonder, I'll be okay
(All this love)
She said I wanna live, I don't wanna die young
I'm a live through the night, just to light up the sun
I don't need to hide, I don't need to run.

All this love
All this love
All this love
All this love
