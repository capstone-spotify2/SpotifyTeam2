I can see it in your eyes,
You're telling me a lie when you said you loved me
And there's something in your smile,
Said you'd be gone in awhile,
So how can you love me

I can hear it in your talk,
You're about to take a walk,
So darlin' please don't lie,
I've been knowing you way too long,
So don't say there's nothing wrong,
You could never fool me, know how

I can see it in your eyes,
What you're trying to disguise,
I can feel it in your touch,
You've fallen out of love,
You could tell me that I'm wrong,

My heart knows I'm right,
I can see it in your eyes

So if it's over, let it be over,
I'd rather face the truth than have to make believe your feelings haven't changed,
Yes, I'll be all right,
After you say good bye,
And I know that I'll be missing you, for a long long time.

I can see it in your eyes,
What you're trying to disguise,
I can feel it in your touch,
You've fallen out of love,
You could tell me that I'm wrong,
My heart knows I'm right,
I can see it in your eyes

You could tell me that I'm wrong,
My heart knows I'm right
I can see it in your eyes
