I'll give it to ya,
I'll give it to ya
All night long 
(yeah)
All night long

I've got stamina stamina 
I know i'm not an amateur amateur

All about peace till I release the beast
And turn into another character.

19 Morphs like a power ranger, 
Last night I was still a stranger,
You let me in now i'm here to change ya,
It's risky but i love the danger,
Danger, danger
Feels like nothin' major, major

One last breath keep goin',
All night long the life keeps showin'

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I can go all night long with you,
If you can go all night long with me,
Let's see what you're made of,
I'm ready to take of.
And I need to know if you're for real,
So here's how it goes, yeah here's the deal,
Can do whatever, (whatever you want)
Have you got the stamina?

I'll give it to ya all night long <i>[x2]</i>

All night long
It's round two, guess what? I'm still here,
You're motivation appear out of thin air,
They can't see what you do to me,
My hearts locked and you've got the key

All night, all night,
Make everything alright, alright,
You've got what i see,
Come bring it to me,
Base drop down hit in the bullseye.
Danger danger, 
feels like nothin' major, major,
One last breath keep goin',
All night long the love keeps showin.
