Weak and frightened
Paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
Lives are taken
Terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields

Pain and deep fear
Hostage in an ancient rage between people torn by their ideals
Willing to die, willing to kill
Hopeless and blind in their world where innocence dies

Weak and frightened
Paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
Lives are taken
Terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields

Rage and deep hate
Isolated in an ancient war with people not so different from you

Willing to fight, willing to try to win an endless battle of pride while innocents die

And then we see them running
See the world is watching this
And we can only try to understand what causes it
And then we see the living
See them crying for their dead
Are we the ones to understand how crazy pain can get

Some people turn in circles
They can never break it through
Some people lost their lives before they died
and now they want it back!

Loss and deep grief
Engulfed in an ever present pain, ancient in practice

Weak and frightened
Paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
Lives are taken
Terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields
