Iâm sick of these niggas, Iâm tired of these niggas
I do not fuck with a lot of these niggas
Gangster hitters, I be with gorillas
Strapped and they ready, you want it you get it
Please do not play with my paper, you finished
Patience is short but them choppers extended
My youngins they thugginâ, they smoking, they fucking
They still out to get it but facing a sentence
Fuck do you phonies be talking about
You do not know what that dramaâs about
Make you a promise, I promise to ride
Streets is a struggle, Iâm tryna survive
Look the bitches, the money we getting
Champagne that we sipping and foreigns to drive
I pull up on em and shit on your lawn
On my paper say owner, you know that itâs mine
Iâm ready for beef just to capitalize
Rappers are petty, they pussy, vajin
Turn your little block to a vacated sign
They get to shooting like red line
Tony Montana, the crib in Atlanta
Thinking bout copping the Wraith or the Phantom
Jump on the jet in my fucking pajamas
Shout out my niggas 100 forever
All my lil niggas are still on probation
My <i>[?]</i> just caught him a charge, Iâm praying he dodge immigration
He say fuck itâs PO and he still on them papers
And he just bought him a chopper, he told me it come with a laser

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
We can make a movie
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
Watch how you maneuver

I'm getting tired of tellin' you niggas
Donât do the zoo, but I know some gorillas
Catch me a body on beats Iâm a killer
Flow like a chopper that shot up a villa
Boy donât forget me, I be with the sinners
I am a vet and you such a beginner
Bitch I run the summers and stunt in the winters
See 90 percent of your shit ainât remembered
Iâm back in this bitch and aim straight at your chest
Kick in the door till I get my respect
Heard the new music, it made me depressed
Free all my niggas that call me collect
We be the business, the lord as my witness
Iâm way too committed, no time for them bitches
Shout out Ms. Simmons, you know you can get it
Iâm the building, them shooters attending
Like knowledge, we ready for war
Nigga was young when I jumped off the porch
Gave up the tigers and now want the Porsche
Once I got right then my mama divorced
Play with my people, I show no remorse
Throw on my jewelry then show up to court
Crib is so big it look like a resort
Nigga we made it, Iâm faded of course
Fuck all these niggas, we fucking they bitch
Hate when they act like they bout it, I guess they just want some attention
Donât let my humbleness fool you nigga
Call up my niggas to call up they niggas to do you nigga

<i>[Hook]</i>

All of my niggas 100 forever
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
Shout out my bitch is 100 forever
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
We can make a movie
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
