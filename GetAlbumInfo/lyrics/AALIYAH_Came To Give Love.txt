<i>[Tann]</i>:
Baby girl you got the whole world screaming
Giving it up for you
You got the party people fiending
Bump it to the roof
From the left side to the right side
And straight to the back
Ain't nothing going on here but a dirty money track
Got the party people waving their hands and doing the rodeo
Aaliyah, why don't you kick it, kick the flow

<i>[Aaliyah]</i>
<i>[1]</i> -I came to give my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls

<i>[Repeat 1 (3x)]</i>

Came to spread my love
Do do do
