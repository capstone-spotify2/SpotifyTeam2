Hey, New York, here I am
No, I got no plan
Hands up in the air, chasing the good vibes
Music on the blocks, fancy boulevards
I'mma take a shot, looking for a good time

I gotta get a taxi now, tryna make my way downtown
Riding on 5th Avenue, 1 on 1 on 2 on 2

Red light, don't don't don't don't stop
We chasing, chasing them cops
Full speed, on t-t-t-tops
Step it up, come on
Step it up, come on
Red light, don't don't don't don't stop
We chasing, chasing them cops
Full speed, on t-t-t-tops
Step it, step it
Step it, step it like you don't care

Step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up

Yo, New York, there you go
Put on a show, I wanna know if it's true what they saying
Forget the rest, put you to the test
I can handle you, but can you handle me, yeah

I gotta get a taxi now, tryna make my way downtown
Riding on 5th Avenue, 1 on 1 on 2 on 2

Red light, don't don't don't don't stop
We chasing, chasing them cops
Full speed, on t-t-t-tops
Step it up, come on
Step it up, come on
Red light, don't don't don't don't stop
We chasing, chasing them cops
Full speed, on t-t-t-tops
Step it, step it
Step it, step it like you don't care

Step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up

(Taxi driver) Just make it quick, make it quick
(Taxi driver) Stop wasting my time
(Taxi driver) Just make it quick, make it quick
(Taxi driver) Step it, step it up
(Taxi driver) Step it, step it up
(Taxi driver) Step it, step it up
(Taxi driver) Step it, step it, step it up
Come on now
Step it, step it like you don't care

Step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
Step it, step it, step it up
