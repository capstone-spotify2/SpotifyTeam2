Only truth can make you see
Only truth can make you love me
Only truth, smile on your face
Only love can take your place
<i>[?]</i>
Let me say

Time, time, we need love and time
Only the truth can tell of this
Time, time, we need love and time
Time, time, time, oh

Only the truth can let you go
Only the truth can hear you love me so
Only the truth can make you see
Tell me the truth if you love me, let me say it

Time, time, can it be reached?
Can you cheat time
True, let's all sing that break
I said

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, let me hear you
Time, time, all we need is time
I wanna be so big, they said

Time, can it reach, yeah
All of the love and all <i>[?]</i>
Say it matters

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
