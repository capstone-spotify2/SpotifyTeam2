The end is fast approaching
The dawn, it is encroaching
The stars will fade into the morning
No matter what betides us
The love that lies inside us
Can twitterpate without any warning

I'll never stop believing
I'm yearning and I'm breathing for you, for you
I'll never stop believing
I'm burning and I'm breathing for you

So hi-i-i-i-igh on the view
High oh the view

I found the words to fight it
The sweetest smelling violet
Like diamond to a dazzling pearl (Yeah)
Your scent intoxicates me
While your Visage elates me
My universe before you unfurls

I'll never stop believing
I'm burning and I'm breathing for you

So hi-i-i-i-igh on the view, oooh
So high oh the view

Ohhh-oh-oh, ohhh-oh-oh
Ohhh-oh-oh, hi-i-i-igh
Ohhh-oh-oh, ohhh-oh-oh
Ohhh-oh-oh, hi-i-i-igh

So high, so high, so high
So high, so high, so high

I'll never stop believing
I'm yearning and I'm breathing for you, for you
I'll never stop believing
I'm burning and I'm breathing for you

So hi-i-i-i-igh on the view, oooh
High oh the view
So hi-i-i-i-igh on the view
(Ohhh-oh-oh, ohhh-oh-oh
Ohhh-oh-oh, hi-i-i-igh)
High oh the view
(Ohhh-oh-oh, ohhh-oh-oh
Ohhh-oh-oh, hi-i-i-igh)
