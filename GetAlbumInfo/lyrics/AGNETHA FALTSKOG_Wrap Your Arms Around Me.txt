Wrap your arms around me...

When you're so far away,
At the end of each day
Counting the moments till you fade away.
Inside my soul,
Under passion's control,
Are feelings I can't find the words to explain
Just like the first time I'm helpless again.

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before.
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone.

The nights are so cold,
With just your memory to hold
I've tried to be strong, reaching out holding on.
Alone in my bed,
I cling to each word you said,
Wanting you more everyday we're apart
And each precious moment is safe in my heart.

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before.
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone.
