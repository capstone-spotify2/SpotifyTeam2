I'll always remember
When you were lost in the rain
I knew that moment, my whole life had changed

You told me to save you
From all the pain in your heart
I knew that moment, we will never part

I can give you everything you need
If you only say you'll stay with me

All my love, is what I wanna give you
Everyday, everyday I love you
I'll be there, to lift you just a little higher
Fill your spirit with desire, all my love
Is what I wanna give you
Everyday, everyday I love you
I?ll be there to take you just a little higher
until you buring with desire, all my love

It's never ending
That flame that grows inside
We're starting something, when our hearts collide

I can give you everything you want
If you only say you'll be the one

All my love, is what I wanna give you
Everyday, everyday I love you
I'll be there, to lift you just a little higher
Fill your spirit with desire, all my love
Is what I wanna give you
Everyday, everyday I love you
I?ll be there to take you just a little higher
until you buring with desire, all my love

I can give you everything you need
If you only say you'll stay with me
