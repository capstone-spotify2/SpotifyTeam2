We started out and life was perfect
I never thought our love would change
But years of ups and downs made a difference
It's not the same as it was yesterday

I don't treat you like I used to
You don't look the same into my eyes
We thought the best would be behind us
But the best keeps getting better all the time

We learned how to love and how to make up
And found what it takes to be enough
Like a 30-year-old wine hearts intertwined
The best keeps getting better all the time

I love you now more than ever
And you appreciate me more today
Melted together, hearts and minds
The best keeps getting better all the time

We learned how to love and how to make up
And found what it takes to be enough
Like a 30-year-old wine, hearts intertwined
The best keeps getting better all the time

Like a 30-year-old wine, hearts intertwined
The best keeps getting better all the time
The best keeps getting better all the time
