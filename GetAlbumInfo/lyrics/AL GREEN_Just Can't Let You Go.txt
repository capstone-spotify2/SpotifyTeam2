Love me
I want you back
I need you more than you think
I can't let you go
Hold me
I'm down to 1-2-3
Two and two is four
I can't let you go

Times spent together
All is dear to me
So you know my mind
All I need is Spring to see
Hold on tight
Can't let you go
Hold on tight
I just can't let you walk out on me

You don't know, know me
Stay around and see
I just can't let you go

Soon there'll be
Someone just for me
I'll be glad
When it comes down
To no one but you and me
I'll be glad when it comes down
To nobody but you and me

Hold on, got to hold on
Just can't let you go
Hold on
I just can't let you go
Hold on, got to hold on
I just can't let you go
