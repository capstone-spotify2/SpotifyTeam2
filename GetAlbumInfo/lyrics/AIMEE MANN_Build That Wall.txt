She's been a long time on the phone
Courting disaster in an undertone
She's feeling nostalgic
And feeling that fall
How could anyone ever fight it
Who could ever expect to fight it when she
Builds that wall

Maybe it's one where time will tell
Maybe it's one where it's just fare-thee-well
I hear her coming
As she walks down the hall
How could anyone ever fight it
Who could ever expect to fight it when she
Builds that wall

I know the choice is made
I can tell, I said, by your guilty face
And I never was wrong to fight it
How does anyone ever fight it?

You couldn't pin this one on me
You knew my thoughts so far as I could see
Well, I'd say it's hopeless
But you make the call
Cause I never was wrong to fight it
And if given the chance, I guess I'll learn to
Build that wall
