They were coming
Right at us
I was running
You were scared
I was happy
I was smiling
Cause I knew
That between me and you
We had the upper hand

They were aiming
We were too
When you're running
Like we were, it's hard to shoot
I ran out and so did you
So I pulled something new
Out of my jacket
They step back and
Got on the ground, laid down
They started covering their eyes
'cause it was too bright
Told 'em
"Get on the ground", they laughed
Through the light in the crowd

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
They've never seen the light of the dreamer
It turns the cold into a believer, oh
The light of the dreamer
Pain comes out just so like a sin hurts
Now I'm a screamer
Ain't there no way in the world
You can find her up
The sun only coming down 'cause you need it
You've never seen the light of the dreamer
No, you need it

No, don't run, don't run
No, don't run from the light of the dreamer
Catch your light on
Don't run, no, don't run
From the light of the dreamer

Now they're with us
There are difference
Let the light out
Like 'em spreading
I can feel it
They see dreams they've never seen
Cause their eyes are not concealed
Raising up their hands, oh

We're the army
Lovin' fighters
Leave them bright
We got the light
Don't need a lighter
I'm ready, and so are you
Knowing I was something new
Yeah, we're crackin'
No turning back now

That they are on the ground, way down
They started covering their eyes
'cause it was too bright
Told 'em
"Get on the ground", they laughed
Through the light in the crowd

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
They've never seen the light of the dreamer
It turns the cold into a believer, oh
The light of the dreamer
Pain comes out just so like a sin hurts
Now I'm a screamer
Ain't there no way in the world
You can find her up
The sun only coming down 'cause you need it
You've never seen the light of the dreamer
No, you need it

No, don't run, don't run
No, don't run from the light of the dreamer
Catch your light on
Don't run, no, don't run
From the light of the dreamer

Lovin' fighters
Leave them bright
We got the light
Don't need a lighter
We don't need a lighter
Got the fire
We survived
Don't need a light
We livin' brighter
Don't need a lighter 
Don't need a lighter

Never seen the light of the dreamer
It turns the cold into a believer, oh
The light of the dreamer
Pain comes out just so like a sin hurts
Now I'm a screamer
Ain't there no way in the world
You can find her up
The sun only coming down 'cause you need it
You've never seen the light of the dreamer
No, you need it

No, don't run, don't run
No, don't run from the light of the dreamer
Catch your light on
Don't run, no, don't run
From the light of the dreamer
