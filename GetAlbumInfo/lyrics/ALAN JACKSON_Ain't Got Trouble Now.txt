The girl I loved, she sure was pretty, 
but always runninâ round.
She finally ran off with a boy from the city, 
and I ainât got trouble now.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I ainât got trouble now, 
no I ainât got trouble now.
I had it before, and Iâll have some more, 
but I ainât got trouble now.

Spent ten years breakinâ my back, 
for the meanest man in town.
Today I walked out and I ainât goinâ back, 
and I ainât got trouble now.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I ainât got trouble now, 
no I ainât got trouble now.
I had it before, and Iâll have some more, 
but I ainât got trouble now.

Had an olâ rust bucket and four ball tires, 
always breaking down.
Been walkinâ every day since it caught on fire, 
and I ainât got trouble now.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I ainât got trouble now, 
no I ainât got trouble now.
I had it before, and Iâll have some more, 
but I ainât got trouble now.

Now I got no ride,I got no money, 
and there ainât no girls in this town.
But the whiskey goes down, smooth as honey, 
and I ainât got trouble now.

<i>[Chorus x3:]</i>
I ainât got trouble now, 
no I ainât got trouble now.
I had it before, and Iâll have some more, 
but I ainât got trouble now.
