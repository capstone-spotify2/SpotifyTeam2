Roaming through the forest
Along the mauntainsides
Moving through the darkness
I'm a creature of the wild

Sneaking up behind you
Hunting in a pack
Attacking out of nowhere
Always from the back

Predator
(I'm a) Predator
Eating you alive
(I'm a) Predator

It's the call of the wild
Pumping up my powers
My fangs are razor-sharp

Nature's takin' over
My instincts are alive

Predator
(I'm a) Predator
Eating you alive
(I'm a) Predator
