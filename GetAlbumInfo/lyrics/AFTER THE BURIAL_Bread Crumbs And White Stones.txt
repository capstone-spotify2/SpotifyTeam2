So I'll keep searching
For a place called home
I'll rip my roots from this earth
Into the unknown
Is it for the dreams I chased
Or the ones I caught
This mystery
This misery is killing me
So now I'll leave behind a murder scene
My life isn't real
It's just a silhouette
And when the sun goes down
I won't exist
I will be the forgotten
Bread crumbs and white stones can't follow me
Overwhelming
Constantly I'm tearing at the seams
The threads that hold me together
They envelop me
I am a shaking man
As my body breaks against the wind
I begin to slowly unravel
Overwhelming
I'm tearing at the seam
The threads that hold me together
They envelop me
And with fervor I am everywhere I never thought I would be
I will never come home
I am a ghost inside your empty house
I don't exist
I will not come home
I'll never come home
