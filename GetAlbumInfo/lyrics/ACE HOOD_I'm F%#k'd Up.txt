I'm fucked up, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm fucked up, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm fucked up, I'm rolling, I'm rolling

Okay, now bad bitches and a friend sip a fit for G
And got more holes knocking at the door, tell them bring them in
Smoking purp, got a fucking pound
White bitch breaking bound
All this gold, cocaine on the floor
Harboring got the poe
Tell your mama bust it open
Rolling drunk off the potion
Hoping I get her open
That pussy, I leave it swollen
I'm the master when you call that up
Beat it up up up like I'm Dr. Paul
I'm up the bat so what it is Shorty?
I'm on that Houston purple serve shit
Never mind, I'm flow, forgot my government
How I peed a pimp though on some Charlie shit
Salute my nigga Bull in case I do forget
I'm getting throwed and I'm way off
Pizza rock, no chase just simply day rock

Switching bitches with my nigga Andy Duff
If you ain't fucked up then what you payin' for?
I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm fucked up, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm high, I'm drunk
My bitch, she faded
My vision so blurry and I may not make it

And I'm back, ghetto once again
Hoping up off that Benz with a chick and she super thick
Chilling with a couple a friends
Baby what's twins but I'll just hop a bin
But know that depends
You ain't fucking off or feeling me
It's hollaback, that's indeed
Nigga cast these supply of weed
Kick oh bring the lean
Fucking swishers roll that paper like my nigga Wiz Khalif
Getting fucked up that's beside the devil cut some
I'm taking Sam shots and I'm hoping I don't pass out
Them bitches hair style, Moly poppin' they all buyin' uhh
I'm fucked up, not focused
Got a 30 pack of them Trojan's
Gonna do some damage with these mixed twins
Never call for block, I do not go 10
I'm a beat that pussy till the morning

Switching bitches with my nigga Andy Duff
If you ain't fucked up then what you payin' for?
I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm fucked up, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm high, I'm drunk
My bitch, she faded
My vision so blurry and I may not make it

I can't even feel my face, oh shit
Is that, is that a pony?
