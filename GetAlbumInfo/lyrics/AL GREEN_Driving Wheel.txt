My baby don't have to work
She don't have to rob or steal
My baby don't have to work
She don't have to rob or steal (Lord)
I give my baby anything that she wants (children, tell you)
I'm her driving wheel

(Thank you, flower
I tell you I'm her driving wheel. Oh, you don't hear me)

Left me this morning
Said she'd be back soon
She left me early this morning
She said she would be back soon (yeah)
She said she'd be back early Friday morning
Or late, late, late late, late Saturday afternoon

(Yeah, that's all right ... Thank you, flower)

I wrote my baby a letter the other day
Don't want nobody to break the seal
I wrote my baby a letter
I don't want nobody to break the seal
This better go straight to my baby, cause I, I, I ...

Thank you, thank you, lord
I tell you I'm a driving wheel
Driving wheel, now
You don't believe me
I'm a driving wheel
Thank you, Father
I tell you I'm a driving wheel

Keep on moving
Keep on grooving
I tell you I'm a driving wheel
