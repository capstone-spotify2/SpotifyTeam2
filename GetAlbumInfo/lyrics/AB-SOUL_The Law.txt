<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law
Yeah
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law
You should, you should do without

I've been slewing through the mail
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female
ASAP
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Hey
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time

I get the feeling that you only playing hard to get
Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge
I know we were divided to restore the balance
Hope I still get you wet while you bending over backwards
Watching over me in ecstacy expecting me
Ya number is 6 and 50 interestingly
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
On your tippy toes for me, just how you posed to be
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago
How these atoms adapt to this it's incredible
They love to go to sleep, but hate to be awake
Treat the eye of horus as if it's just a symbol
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
But luckily love is the only law
Love is the, love is the only..

Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Take your time baby

Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
And you the only one that know what I mean
You know what I mean

And they say our separation was sacrificial and all
But I'm in awe
These hybrids getting high but they don't get it at all
The pain of division is nothing
The joy of disillusion is all but I'm in awe man
I know that you were my discarded woman
Like to say you everything but nothing
But you nothing but my everything
How shall I explain
Aye man

I've been slewing through the mail
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female
ASAP, yeah
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Take your time baby

One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Can't forget about the Queen

<i>[Rapsody:]</i>
Queens, we are nodding back
Understand we are his back and
When he puts the arc in your back understand
That we took him to heaven where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes you show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that girl I'll be your night
Your knight in shining armor
Cause you're my heart, queen
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours
Cause we all Gods
And God is Queen and God is love and
Love stays above all
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God

Love
Love
Love
Love is the law
Love is the only law
Love is the only law
Love

Ay yo Bentley, remember that chick you brought by the studio?
You thought that was your woman, your woman
Ain't your woman, she's soul's woman
It's love tho B it's love
Yeah
