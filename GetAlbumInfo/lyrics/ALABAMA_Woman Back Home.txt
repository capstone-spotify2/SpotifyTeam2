I got her in my heart and I got her in my head
I got her in love and I got her in bed
I got her to think that's all I own
If it wasn't for her love I'd be all alone.

She's my woman back home that treats me right
Early in the morning till late at night
It doesn't really matter anytime's all right
Wish my woman back home was here tonight,
To hold me tight.

Thinking about her now in my hotel room
I'm wondering when and I'm hoping it's soon
I see her smile and her eyes are green
She's the prettiest girl my eyes have ever seen.

She's my woman back home that treats me right
Early in the morning till late at night
It doesn't really matter anytime's all right
Wish my waman back home was here tonight,
To hold me tight.

She's my woman back home that treats me right
Early in the morning till late at night
It doesn't really matter anytime's all right
Wish my waman back home was here tonight,
To hold me tight...
