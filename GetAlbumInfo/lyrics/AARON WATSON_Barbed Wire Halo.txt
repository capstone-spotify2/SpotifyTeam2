Well God bless Texas
And Deakon Shackleford
He read the bible seven times
And he believed every word
That ol' beat up leather book had been through it all
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
Singin'
"Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound"
That saved a wrech like me
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishin' after church 
And taught me things I needed to know
No, Deakon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns 
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down the street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo

He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tatoo
He was on a ship off at sea when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Singin'
"I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind
But now I see"

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down the street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
Sweet chariots coming forth to carry me home
