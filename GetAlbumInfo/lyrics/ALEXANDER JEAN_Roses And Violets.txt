There's something on my mind
There's something on my mind
You're miles away, but your heart feels close by
The sun is in my eyes
The sun is in my eyes
They say love is blind, but with you

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You

Love is not enough
Why can't love just be enough
Right when it's good, time it messes it up
Please don't let me go
When we come and go
Distance can help hearts to grow

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You

Days are getting longer
The nights are feeling colder
When we are not together
I'm falling apart
'Cause all I want is you
And all I need is you
Baby, you may be somewhere else too far from me
Come home soon
Oh-oh

There's something on my mind
There's something on my mind
You're miles away, I'm so sick of goodbye

Roses are red
Violets are blue
One day I'm meant
To be with you
You

Roses are red
Violets are blue
One day I'm meant
To be with you
You
