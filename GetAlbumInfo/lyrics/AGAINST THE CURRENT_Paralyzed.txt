Have you had a million reasons why you wish you'd never seen the truth?
Have you looked into the mirror and the problem's staring back at you

I can't control myself, don't know who I've been
And who is this monster wearing my skin?
A movie in black and white. When will it end?
'Cause every time I scream no one hears me

It feels like I'm paralyzed,
and I can't
escape from the prison I'm
living in.
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed

Have you searched for something deeper out of fear that life's a lonely road?
Have you roamed the darkest corners of the earth until you're just a ghost?

I can't control myself, don't know who I've been
And who is this monster wearing my skin?
A movie in black and white. When will it end?
'Cause every time I scream no one hears me

It feels like I'm paralyzed,
and I can't
escape from the prison I'm
living in.
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed

I'm not afraid, I can face my demons
Even if they tear me down
If I fall, let me fall, it might take time
But I'll find my own way out

It feels like I'm paralyzed,
and I can't
escape from the prison I'm
living in.

It feels like I'm paralyzed,
and I can't
escape from the prison I'm
living in.
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life

It feels like I'm paralyzed
feels like I'm paralyzed

But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed
