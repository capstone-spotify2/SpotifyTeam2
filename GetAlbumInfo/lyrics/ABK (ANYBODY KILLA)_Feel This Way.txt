As these words are turning I keep thinking this will never end.
At times I get lonely and I need someone to confide in.
Always under pressure and I never take time to relax.
Sometimes I just wish I could collapse.
But then I'd miss you.

Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?

I try to focus and just handle things that come my way.
Don't let shit get to me 'cause there will always be another day.
Maintain my emotions if I don't then I'll be sure to fall.
And I'll be damned to let myself desaulve. So you better get used to me.

Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.

These nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer.
When will it end? Even though I really don't want it to.
