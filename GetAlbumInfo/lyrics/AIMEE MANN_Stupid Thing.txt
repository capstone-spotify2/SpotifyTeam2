Nothing was saving our day
There was nothing to say
But you said something anyway
Claiming I stepped out of line
Which forced you to leave me
As if that idea was mine

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started

I bet you knew it would come
That's just like you to sit back
And just play it dumb
One word of warning would help
But that sacrifice was made
Trying to save yourself

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started

Maybe that's just how I am
To fall where I stand
Or I'm weak for that kind of man
One who looks helpless and brave
But you turned into a coward
I don't care for the parts you saved

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you outsmarted

Oh, you stupid thing...
