It's so hard to believe in things that you can't see yourself
See yourself
Behind the scene lies more than you can understand yourself
Stand yourself

Now they tell you what you want to hear
But when they're done will you still live in fear?

And everything you said to me put me on my knees
And everything you said to me put me on my knees

I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

You're told that selfishness will guide your path
What will you do when that just doesn't last?

And everything you said to me put me on my knees
And everything you said to me put me on my knees

It's so hard to believe in you
I'm not quite clear what I should do
And now I know that you're the only one
But do they know that you're the only one

And I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

And I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

And I can't believe a thing you say
I can't believe a thing you say

It's so hard to believe in things that you can't see...
