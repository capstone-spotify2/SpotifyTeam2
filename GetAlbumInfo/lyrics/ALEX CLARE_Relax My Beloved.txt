Relax my beloved, don't worry for me,
Don't shed a tear for me always be near for me.
Be confident my love don't bow your head for me,
Promise you'll smile for me don't ever cry for me.
You know these walls they may fall down,
But I'll still hold on to you,
At heights higher than you'd imagine me too.

Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before,
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door.

Be still my heart, I'm only a moment away,
In the next room or at the break of day.
And I would walk, once again to see your face again,
And I'd hear every word you'd have to say.

Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before,
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no.
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before,
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no no.

(Ooh)

Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before,
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door.
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before,
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no no no.
