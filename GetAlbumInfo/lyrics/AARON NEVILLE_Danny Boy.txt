Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
Cause I'll be here in sunshine, or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
