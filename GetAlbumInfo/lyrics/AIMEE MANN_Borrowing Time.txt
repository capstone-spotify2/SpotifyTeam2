Get up, the needle has pricked a little finger.
She wants the beautiful child the blood will bring her.
You ask a question in the mirror.
Alas, no answer could be clearer.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.

Get up, a substitute artist just reprieved you
Beware the flattery ruses have deceived you.
The kings of yesterday falling,
But you'll come when destiny's calling.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.

I don't want anything anyway.
I was happy with what I had yesterday.
Who wants the whole weight of the world
When it'll drag you downâ¦
Underground?

Today she's singing a song called Hallelujah
You stay, she's bringin' the poison apple to ya.
Sun's up and reveille's playing
You know what everyone's saying.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
Get up, get up, you're borrowing time.
