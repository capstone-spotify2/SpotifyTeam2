Dream that there will come a day
Dream that the Lord will make her wake
Dream, dream, dream

Wake up early and..

Dream the stars down from the sky
Dream without knowing the reason why
Just dream, just dream, oh dream

What I wanna do is..
Make it last forever
Make it last forever
Make it, make it, make it, make it

(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)

Let me say this one thing..

Dream I'm the one that you know
Dream a new and different stroke
Just dream... dream
(We can make it all come true)
I wanna know, I wanna... Take me with you

(Make it last forever)
Make it last forever
Take me along with you
While you make it last forever
In a dream, you can make it...
Oh, I wanna go with you
Make it last forever
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna...

(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)
Everybody likes to...
Everybody wants to dream sometime

Dream... shh!... dream...
Shh!... dream
(We can make it all come true)
Dream. Shh!... Wontcha dream?
The stars are shining bright
Dream
Let your mind and you heart
Just melt, melt melt like ice
Dream
(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)

Dream. Don't take it, Lord 
Just dream
(We can make it all come true)
