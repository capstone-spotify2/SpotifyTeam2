Pretty sure I had a dream
That you woke up here by my side
Not sure what had happened, but I know
When I'm with you, I'm alright

I know that you're from far away
And I know it will takes some time
Can we live in this moment cause I know
Don't want to say our goodbyes
Cause I feel so...
So

Brand new
I feel so brand new
With you I'm brand new
Girl you knock me off my shoes
I feel so brand new
I feel so brand new
With you I'm brand new
Didn't think I'd fall for you
Didn't think I'd fall for you

Cause they said that you were trouble
I tell them I don't really care (I don't care)
Cause you make all my sadness disappear
I'm better with you, yes I swear (this I swear, I swear)

And I know that it's been so hard to deal with
Only see you once in awhile, baby it's killing me
But I need to hear that you're down to take care of
Take a chance on me

I feel so brand new
I feel so brand new
With you I'm brand new
Girl you knock me off my shoes
I feel so brand new
With you I'm brand new
I feel so brand new
Didn't think I'd fall for you
Didn't think I'd fall for you

(Ahhhhh... Ahhhh)

I feel so brand new
When I am with you baby
I feel so brand new
When I am with you baby
I feel so brand new
When I am with you baby
I feel so brand new
When I am with you baby
