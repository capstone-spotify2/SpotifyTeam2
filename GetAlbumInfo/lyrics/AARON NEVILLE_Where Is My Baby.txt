It's a beautiful morning
looks like its going to be a beautiful day
but where is my baby?
Oh where is my baby

I breathe in a breath of fresh air
oh but again I say
where is my baby

Everything seems so right
Except for most important thing in my life

But where is my baby
Where can she be
Won't somebody please
Send my baby back to me

Boss told me in three days
I'd be up for a raise
Oh but where is my baby
Oh where is my baby

Going to look for a new car
Like that raven I saw
But where is my baby

What went wrong I couldn't say
I tried to please her
In every way

Oh but where is my baby
Where can she be

Won't somebody please
Send my baby back to me

A year has come and gone
Since I've been all alone
Lord and I still oh I still haven't seen my baby

I still hope and pray
That she'll return someday
But where is my baby

I bought a house I thought she would like
In case she'd ever decide to be my wife

And then the word came
You know by telephone
Said you don't want to see you baby
She's better off gone

Said while in a travel
A curiosity 
Led her into the wrong hands
Into a land of fantasy

Now she hangs out
Where those folks do
With the problems she'll never shake
Said your baby's through

No 
No, no I don't want to hear it
