I don't wanna play cupid again
Don't wanna be just a friend
I know it sounds selfish but it's just how I feel
Don't want to be called a matchmaker
Introduced then he takes her
I'm just being honest and I'm keeping it real
Don't wanna know, say it ain't so
Cause I loved her first, but that's okay
Cause at the end of the day

I gotta learn to be just me
I gotta learn to smile and be happy
I gotta know when it's meant to be
And when it's not
I gotta learn to let you go
You know you can't choose who you fall for
I gotta know if it's meant to be and I know now,
It's not for you and me

So maybe it's not too bad
Seeing her with a new man
I just want her to live her life the way that she feels
Maybe it's okay I played cupid
Otherwise I'd be stupid
To keep her from the ones that she was destined to meet
Don't let me see, gotta let it be
You know that it still hurts,
But that's okay,
Cause at the end of the day

I gotta learn to be just me
I gotta learn to smile and be happy
I gotta know when it's meant to be
And when it's not
I gotta learn to let you go
You know you can't choose who you fall for
I gotta know if it's meant to be and I know now,
It's not for you and me

Now I wanna know, how they're doing
I don't care if I loved her first
Cause I'm okay,
And at the end of the day

I gotta learn to be just me
I gotta learn to smile and be happy
I gotta know when it's meant to be
And when it's not
I gotta learn to let you go
You know you can't choose who you fall for
I gotta know when it's meant to be and I know now,
It's not for you and me
Yeah

Everybody, eh

I'm a matchmaker, baby yeah
Eh, oh yeah yeah
C'mon now
Lemme hear you, ba ra ba ra
