Hey we're gonna be around
Hey we're gonna work it out
Hey there's nothing to fight about
Today we're gonna be about

You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away

I'm gonna be around
Hey I'm gonna work it out
Hey there's plenty to fight about
No way I'm ever going down

You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me
You can tell me all the things you want to say
'Cause I'll get better anyway

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care

You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care

Hey
