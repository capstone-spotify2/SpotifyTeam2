A ship approaches off the starboard bow
The time has come to fight, the time to strike is now
Reload the cannons, and sharpen up your swords
They will regret the day they faced the pirate horde

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas

A flash of thunder lights up the midnight sky
Fifty dead across the deck as the ships draw side by side
Raise up your cutlasses and quest into the fight
A reign of terror we shall bring unto our foes this night

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell!

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas
A reign of terror on the seas
We'll bring these poseurs to their knees

And now the time has come to die
Your destiny is nigh
