The whole time all week ha o dlale
New posts, more likes, you smiling hah-ah-ah
You a superstar tonight
Let's see how far it goes
The whole time all week ha o dlale
New posts, more likes, you smiling hah-ah-ah
I see you got someone tonight
Let's see how far it goes

I should've known better me and you don't click like that
I'm ashamed, I can't believe I tried to cling like that
Mama said it, you won't find a hoe that clean like that
Took advantage of the fact, the main reason I rap
With your cunning ways and that pretty face
You could do some damage
Couple dinner dates
It's as easy as pie to cut the cake
Just as easy as you sticking around to chow the paper
Fellow slimes need to realize now and not later
It's too late, it's too late
These hoes is two-faced, they got two faces
You look so real with your makeup on
I can't distinguish between the real and the faker ones
A bunch of creepers in the late night
Texting I miss you in the same night
I should've known, it was in plain sight
I should've known when you had Saudi as your profile picture
Or when you wrote a tweet saying Nasty C is your nigga

But then again I'm guessing this is the reason
Why we always fuss and fight
I mean you the reason why I always cuss on flights
I'm sick and tired
I hate it, I had enough
You don't really like me
I see it, it's just a bluff
I can't believe I'm bumping Chris Brown's Loyal
I can't believe I put it all down for you
I put you in the map, girl you so spoiled
I fucked you like a queen it was so royal
Nou die las se o ntlwaela masepa
This is not what I put in my time for
And I'm past that, and I'm quarter to fucking off
I'mma smoke all this weed and fuck all these bitches
Sip on this lean and burn all these writtens
Because they're mostly about you
If not then they definitely for you
But I should've know when you had Jodi as your profile picture
Or when you wrote a tweet saying Emtee is your nigga

New day same nigga new hoe
Too wavy more thicker red bone
High heels high waist, deal lord she a ten
I ain't worried 'bout you no more
Long hair, natural no extensions
I don't care, burn in hell do the <i>[?]</i>
Life is good, she a twelve, you and six and
Her pussy good, even better than your shit and
I wish you and 'em niggas a happy life
Full of dog days, more arguments and cold nights
Bad neck, three play, poor pipe
Meaning bad seks more bad seks, yeah that's right
New day same nigga new hoe
Too wavy more thicker red bone
Should've known when I put her as my profile picture
That she your best friend
Bitch come or came quicker
