I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
'Cause I came too far

Tryin' to know what's going on
Echoes on my celluar phone
I notice a couple items missin'
Could it be the feds still listenin'

See, I don't beat those cases
Did time for the miscellanous
And they proceed to keep on watchin'
'Cause I don't seen them lately

Interrogated my mom
Locked up half of my crew
But I can guarantee one thing
That I won't let you

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round
I won't, let you stop me now
I won't, 'cause I came too far

I won't, let you ruin my day
I won't, let you stop my pay
I won't, no, not today
I won't 'cause I came too far

Devil's always watchin' me
Evils always stalkin' me
God has been protectin' me
And that's how I got this far

'Cause when you look at me
You see an angel
Can't believe I been through half the things
That I went through

'Cause everyday I see a face
Misconstrued by the human race
So please don't judge me unless you know me
'Cause I won't let you

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round
I won't, let you stop me now
I won't, 'cause I came too far

I won't, let you ruin my day
I won't, let you stop my pay
I won't, no, not today
I won't 'cause I came too far

Came too far to turn back now
Came too far to turn back now
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Ain't nobody gonna stop me

Came too far to turn back now
Came too far to turn back now
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Ain't nobody gonna stop me

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round
I won't, let you stop me now
I won't, 'cause I came too far

I won't, let you ruin my day
I won't, let you stop my pay
I won't, no, not today
I won't 'cause I came too far

I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
