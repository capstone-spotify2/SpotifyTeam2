She's all alone
Making her way to a cold, empty home 
Nobody waiting and no one to hold
She's holding her own 
He wakes up late
Stares at the mirror to find his own face 
Picks out the pieces he hides from within 
He doesn't fit in, do you?

I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 

Opens her eyes
Looks around her 
There's faith in disguise 
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies 
She swallows her pride 
Somebody care, hard to be seen when there's nobody there 
It's getting closer, no need to pretend 
Just let it in and believe 

I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 

Maybe today or maybe tomorrow 
Guess the hands of fate
Been making you wait too long 
I know the way to forget all your sorrow 
Be the first in line to admit that you were wrong 
Sometimes 

I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 

Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night
