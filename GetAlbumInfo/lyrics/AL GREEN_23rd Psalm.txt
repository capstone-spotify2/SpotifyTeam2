The lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Ohh, He making me lie down in green pastures
Ohh, He leadeth me beside the still waters, ohh
Ohh, He restoreth my soul
And He leads me in the path in righteousness
For his name's sake

Yea, though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will not fear, thou art with me
Ohh, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me
Ohh,Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of my enemies

Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
Ohh, but <i>[?]</i> yea, my, my <i>[?]</i>
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, ohh, amen
Would you help me? Would you help me stay here?
Amen, why don't you have a seat? Amen
Everybody have to say is a, amen
