Some days are harder than others
Mountains we climb to get things done
Trying to make sense of the way I'm feeling
Looking for sanctuary but finding none

You're in my head, you're in my heart
Too busy to stop, too late to start
I don't wanna hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Some people are stronger than others
One smile can make some people cry
Hiding away won't make it easier
Taking you're hand, but I ask you why

You're in my head, you're in my heart
Too busy to stop, too late to start
I don't wanna hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Don't you ever listen?
I really need you to
You're in my head, you're in my heart

Baby you won't listen when I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear when I get to talk to you
I know that you need me more than I need you
But don't ask so much of me, it's what you always do
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
