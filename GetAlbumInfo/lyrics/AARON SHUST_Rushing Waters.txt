Let us hear the sound of angels
Sing holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Let us see the saints and elders
Gathering in worhip 'round Your throne
There's only one desire
In the heart of Your redeemed
To step deeper in the place
Where earth and heaven meet

With the sound like rushing waters
We sing blessing honor and praise
With one voice that rolls like thunder
Every tongue will now proclaim
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!

Oh we long to hear the nations
Declaring You are Lord of everything
Every king and every ruler
Throwing down their crowns at Your feet

All majesty and power
On the earth and above
Be to the only God
Who was and is and is to come

With the sound like rushing waters
We sing blessing honor and praise
With one voice that rolles like thunder
Every tongue will now proclaim
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!

There's only one desire
In the heart of Your redeemed
To step deeper in the place
Where earth and heaven meet
To step deeper in the place
Where earth and heaven meet

With the sound like rushing waters
We sing blessing honor and praise
With one voice that rolles like thunder
Every tongue will now proclaim
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
