Long time ago
In Bethlehem
So the
Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas day

Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas Day

While shepherds
Watch
Their flocks
By night
They see
A bright new
Shining star
They hear a choir
Sing a song
The music seemed
To come from afar

Now Joseph
And his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem
That night
They found no place
To bear her child
Not a single room
Was in sight

Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas day
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas day

And then
They found
A little nook
In a stable
All forlorn
And in a manger
Cold and dark
Mary's little boy
Was born

Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas day
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas Day
