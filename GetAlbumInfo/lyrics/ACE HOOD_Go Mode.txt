I told him right, right that shit, right
I got it, bitch I got it
Six I got it

Club jumpin' once again, hydraulics
I'm doin' numbers in the Benz, big body
You can catch me up in Liv poppin' bottles
Ain't trippin' over shit, I got it
My young niggas, they on go mode shit
I know the shooters, they on go mode shit
I told you niggas I'm in beast mode, shit
No bricks, we don't go slow

All gas on your dog ass, shit
Fuck who you know, you need a G pass
My little homies pull up quick fast
Extendos with the ski mask
Nah, y'all don't really want that
I can have them creep, they be in that all black
Where the weed at?
I'm on the Beam back
I got them diamonds on my collar playing freeze tag
I'm in the club lit
I'm from the 9 5th
My nigga Fat Boy don't trust you, I'ma squeeze clip
Cause that's my gang, gang
We gotta maintain
Just know I'm king in my city like Lebron James
They call me Ace Hood
You know my face good
I'm about to pop 100 bottles for the whole hood
So cut that hatin' bruh
Hood nation in this bitch, you can't fuck with us, gang

Club jumpin' once again, hydraulics
I'm doin' numbers in the Benz, big body
You can catch me up in Liv poppin' bottles
Ain't trippin' over shit, I got it
My young niggas, they on go mode shit
I know the shooters, they on go mode shit
I told you niggas I'm in beast mode, shit
No bricks, we don't go slow

Phone call so I split another swisher
Let down you niggas, when I'm always gon' deliver
County jail kill you for a roll of tissue
Rolling Stone, time to grace another issue
60 cars in my yard, I'm tryna touch 100
Have a seizure, gettin' brain, shawty shakin' somethin'
Breaking news, homicide, and that's just how it go
My nigga died in my arms, that's back in '94
I'm tryna stay alive and ride like it's Makaveli
Last boy crossed mine, them niggas wasn't ready
I take this war shit deeply, this shit I enforce
They even fired 20 shots at my silver Rolls Royce
Next mornin' shit, I went and put the rims on it
Diss niggas and go get a few spins on it
Good dope, you can always put a tan on it
Wayne came home and I put a Benz on it

You wanna talk about doin' some real shit nigga.
What y'all niggas out here doin' nigga.
My nigga just came home from nigga doin' 17 nigga, came home to that two door brand new nigga.
You can smell the motherfuckin' leather nigga
