I'm a high school lover, and you're my favorite flavor
Love is all, all my soul
You're my playground love

Yet my hands are shaking
I feel my body remains, time's no matter, I'm on fire
On the playground, love.

You're the piece of gold the flashes on my soul.
Extra time, on the ground.
You're my playground love.

Anytime, anywhere,
You're my playground love.
