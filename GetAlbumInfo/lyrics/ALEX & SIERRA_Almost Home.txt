Lost in innocence
Take this fragile heart
We know where we've been
All these miles together

Fall into my skin
Crash into these arms
We know how this ends
Fade into forever

The road is wild
We're holding on for life
Like a child
Who's not afraid to cry
We're escaping to a place they'll never know
Just you and me love
We are almost home

Lost inside your eyes
As brilliant as the stars
Show me every side
The good, the bad, the better

The road is wild
We're holding on for life
Like a child
Who's not afraid to cry
We're escaping to a place they'll never know
Just you and me love
We are almost home

Promise you I'll be
The promise you can keep
Till the end of time
And on the other side

The road is wild
We're holding on for life
Like a child
Who's not afraid to cry
We're escaping to a place they'll never know
Just you and me love
Just you and me love
Just you and me love
We are almost home
