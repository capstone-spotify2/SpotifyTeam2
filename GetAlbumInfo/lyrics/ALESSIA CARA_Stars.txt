Knock on my door, boy come home
You stay in my head
Lay in my arms, why won't you?
It's been way too long
What you waiting on?
Cause I've been laying here
Learning what the memories won't do
See I need you and baby I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart

We could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around
Why don't you?
'Til the end of time
Say that you'll be mine
An uphill climb fighting what the heart
Really wants to do
See I need you
And sometimes we need to
Shed our facade and be just who we are
All broken and torn, then we could be stars

Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

Piercing lights in the dark
Make the galaxy ours
Kingdom right where we are
Shining bright as a morning
You'll never be lonely
Just promise you'll love me
I'm never too far
And we'll never part
And we could be stars

Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...

Just find way to get home
There's a space in my heart
Open arms for you to run to
Baby close your eyes and take the leap
To make believe in fairytales
I'll meet you there
Oh yea, I'll fall too
See I've wanted you here
All along but my fear
Just keeps haunting me won't let me go
So it's hard to say I love you

We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...
