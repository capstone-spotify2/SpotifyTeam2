If I had the one last chance to do things over in my life
One last chance to say things to people before they left or past on,
The opportunity to see the ones close to me every day,
Just to say: hey,
If I had that one last chance, then, then,
I'd be all right.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If I had one last chance to say: hey, hey
I would be all right,
If I had one last chance to say: hey, hey
I would be alright.

If I had just one last chance to tell you how I feel
For leaving here eternally.
I would tell you what you meant to me
And what's been going on.
If I had just one last chance to say
What's on my mind,
Cause ever since you had to leave,
There's some people who ain't been the same,
Because it takes time.

If I had just one last chance to really say goodbye,
Right before you went away.
I think it'd really makes a difference to me,
And I'd be all right.
If I had just one last chance to apologize,
For everything I put you through.
I would probably finally rest and peace
Instead of sleepless nights.

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

If I had just one last chance to hear you speak to me,
What would you say? about the way that I carry on, in my life.
If I had just one last chance to try and make it right,
What advice would you give, that'd make me wanna just calm me down,
And re-think things twice. (If I just had one chance)

If I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)
If I had one last chance, just to tell you, goodbye
If I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)
If I had one last chance... Why'd you have to go!?

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

If I had one last chance, I would not keep you long,
The bond that we had is strong enough to carry on,
Inside the songs we sing, the memory of you will bring
Us closer to everything that's keeping us all a team.
If I had one last chance just say goodbye,
I'd tell you that I'd miss you until the day I die.
If I could see your face in front of me once again,
The room would brighten up and the world would see me grin.

<i>[Chorus x6]</i>
