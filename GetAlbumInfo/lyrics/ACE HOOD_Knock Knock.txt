<i>[Intro:]</i>

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Knock knock, bang, bang, where the cash at? (Hey where the cash?)
Knock knock, bang, bang, where the cash at? (Hey where the cash?)
Where the cash at? (Hey, Where the cash?)
Where the cash at? (Hey, Where the cash?)
Hey knock knock, bang, bang, where the cash?

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Ok see, ain't nothing funny boy them dollars keep coming
Ok I got a lot of money
Ain't shit change, Big face hundreds
Pinky and the brain, Triple black cars
Bitch you know the name
Mr. Hood lover, supermodel brains
Kicking down the door, give me what I came for
Checking with my shooters, blow a hole in your kango
They some barracudas And I'm up with the cash flow...
They some assholes
I think I'm Castro, I think I'm Scarface
Blowing money fast, Ricky Rose'
Big fire with me, up in the parleyed

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Hey knock, knock, bang, bang, bitch I'm past that
Hey wait a minute, bitch I think I had a relapse
Don't jack my money I ain't asking where the cash at
Pull out that chopper make you wonder where your legs at
Hold up wait doctor better ask him where your meds at
Where the cash at? Better have that
Super money shit, now can you smell that?
I'm on my grizzle trying make a milli
Duffle full of money more up in for dinner
That's ground paper only thing I'm chasing
Money over bitches, that's just in my nature
Coming for my mullah I'm sharp with that eraser
