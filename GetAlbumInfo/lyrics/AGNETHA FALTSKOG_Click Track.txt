Business and pleasure
Keeping you up,
Hunting for treasure
You can't dig enough,
Growing but losing
Staying up late,
All the nightclubs are closing
But you've got a date.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You can't mix, you can't switch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave,
Click track, Click track.

Move at your leisure
Make tracks leave no signs,
Like a fire in the desert
With winds from behind,
You're getting hot and live wired
Using down time,
All for business and pleasure
Time after time.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You got bought, it's a bitch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave
Click track, Click track.

Pupil to pupil
Scanning the screen,
You read it all over
And steal the scenes,
You're rougher than Crusoe
Bedded in leaves,
And you're looking for Friday
To answer your needs.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You can't mix you can't switch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You got bought, it's a bitch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You can't mix you can't switch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave
Click track, Click track.
