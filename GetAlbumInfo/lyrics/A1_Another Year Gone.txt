I watched the ice melt away
I saw the cold wind change
But like in an old snow globe
In my world, it's always winter

As flakes settle to the ground 
You turn me upside down 
And back to start I go
In my world, it's always winter

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone

Here on your window sill
It's as if time stood still
I'm stuck in this wonderland 
But it's all fake
It's only glitter 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone

Be careful how hard you shake
Cause one day this glass will break
Water will flow like tears
And I'll sail away on that river

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
All by myself
Another Year Gone
