The sun is up and here we are
We tried to catch a shooting star
Forever after for a da-ay
What came together fell apart

Pick me up, my mind and my body's ready
I'm so scared at the thought of going steady
I don't want to leave 'cause I like you
I really like you

Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
(The rough, the rough...)

I played it out a million times
I've loved a million Valentines
Forever after for a da-ay
I wonder if you will be mine

Pick me up, my mind and my body's ready
I'm so scared at the thought of going steady
I don't want to leave 'cause I like you
I really like you

Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
(The rough, the rough...)
(Diamond in the rough)
(The rough, the rough...)
(Diamond in the rough)
(The rough, the rough...)

I'll be leaving soon
No matter what I do
I'll be leaving soon
No matter what I do

Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Lookin' for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
In the rough
(Diamond in the rough)
(The rough, the rough...)
