He's got the power - he's like a god
But he's the devil of flesh and blood
A '45 is his religion - code of silence his belief
It's the kiss of death
A '45 is his religion - code of silence his belief

You can find them in a gutter
You will find 'em in your church
They always knows each other
They call it family

You may end up six-feet-under
Anywhere and anytime
It's a one-way-street with a thousand lanes
And a million ways to die

A Thompson sub-machine gun made my day

Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down

A godfather's kiss - an icepick in your eye
Sick, dirty and mean
It's like a killing machine

Can you hear your mother crying
Can you see your father die
Can you walk away from children
Dying facedown in the dirt

But if you break the code of silence
You gotta do it anyway
If we don't stop the violence
The mob is here to stay

A pair of concrete slippers
- there're all vultures all over your back
Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down

They will terminate your contract
they will finalize the deal
Sick, dirty and mean
It's a killing machine

A '45 is his religion - code of silence his belief
It's a double barreled shotgun with an Ouzi on the side

Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down
If you wanna be a songbird -
there's an axe to clip your wings
Sick, dirty and mean
It's a killing machine

Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean
