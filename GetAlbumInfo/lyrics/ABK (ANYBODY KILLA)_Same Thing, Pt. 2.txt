Iâm as crazy as I wanna be, ainât no stopping me
Buck wild, tearing up the streets in the D
Just a native with some war paint actin a fool
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

Smoking weed like itâs free and the first to kill a 40
Only one to shoot a pistol in the middle of a party
Hanging on the block without a clue what to do
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

Iâm not sayin we no good just a little abnormal
Underground is where we lay, the main stream is too formal
Iâm learning things they donât teach in the school
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
If you do what I do (Yea)
And I do what you do (Yea)
Wouldnât that kinda make us all the same (Yea)

Wait for the right time, patient like a snake
Slither to your enemy then show his ass some hate
This is just something that I like to do
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

Always down with a BBQ, drinkin brew with the crew
Up til the sun come, way past curfew
Talking about things that I wanna pursue
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

Never sit and argue, squash it with my tennis shoe
Kung-fu a motherfuckas head into fondue
Thatâs how it is, and Iâll never improve
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

I prefer Yager bombs instead of Absolute
But Iâd rather have a blunt packed with purple or blue
Red skin with the hatchet running looking confused
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

Ever since I was a youth in pursuit to amuse
Crassin(?) Avenue I cruise to promote my new
I did everything I could to make my name break through
And some of yaâll be doing the same things too

I was showing up late cause I had to finish smoking
You know how the weed have you in slow motion
Thank god Iâm not alone because it wouldnât be cool
Iâm so glad yaâll be doing the same things too

(What time, um, I thought this was tony from the block
Tonysâ on after this rap)

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

You do (yeah)
I do (yeah)
Wouldnât that kinda make us all the same? (yeah) (x2)
You do
I do
You do, come on put your hands up just like this
You do

Yeah you old lady in the back, shake them hips grandma

Somebody in this bitch get me a drink. Iâm thirsty
