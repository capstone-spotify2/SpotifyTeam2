Hey Juliana 
Will you give it up and come with me?
I'll drive to California
Will you give it up and come with me?
Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be fine
Time to be a little more dangerous
Cause this is all about tonight

Gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get away from here
Wanna get out wanna get out
Wanna get away from here
And I heard them talking
You feel so lonely
Just come along with me

Come on Juliana
Can you picture getting old with me?
I'll drive to California
Will you give it up and come with me?
Oh it's never gonna be so perfect
Never gonna be so right
Time to be a little more dangerous
Cause this is all about tonight

Gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get away from here
Wanna get out wanna get out
Wanna get away from here
And I heard them talking
You feel so lonely
Just come along with me

Come on Juliana
I'll drive to California
Come on Juliana
Will you leave it all behind

So if you hear this message 
And you can't erase it
Don't forget to kill the lights
And come along with me tonight

(Gotta get away)
Gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get away from here
Wanna get out wanna get out
Wanna get away from here
And I heard them talking
You feel so lonely...

Gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get away from here
Wanna get out wanna get out
Wanna get away from here
And I heard them talking
You feel so lonely
Just come along with me
