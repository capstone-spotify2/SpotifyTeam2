I'm distilling everything she said into a potion
But it's always going to my head in slow motion
Oh nightmare girl

Things are getting weirder 
At the speed of light
Nightmare girl
All this fever dreaming kills my appetite
For love and restless nights

Once she wanted me to exercise her self-possession
And then failing that she wanted lives and vivisection
Oh nightmare girl

Things are getting weirder 
At the speed of light
Nightmare girl
All this fever dreaming kills my appetite 
For love and restless nights

I'm on a train to Brooklyn
I'm on the IRT
I've gotta think I'm saving the day
I get a call in the night
I get a call at three
I gotta go and make it OK

'Cause things are getting weirder at the speed of light
Nightmare girl
All this fever dreaming kills my appetite
Nightmare girl

Things are getting weirder 
Things are getting weirder 
Things are getting weirder
