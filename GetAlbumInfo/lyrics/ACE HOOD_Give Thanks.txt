Devil get off me
Blessed up
Count up
Nation
Woo

Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-feelin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everything champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

I'm in the end zone
Fuck it's a field go
I know the real zoe's
You know the weirdos
I'm on some fly shit
I like a fly bitch
Used to see cockroaches
When I hit the light switch
Young nigga came up
How could they blame us
Know when the money arrived we never decided to change up
Unless it's the whip game
Or maybe the wrist game
I'm with the big thing
We all on risk game
Rolling cookies in the papers
Ballin' like I'm in the majors
Chosen one I got the favor
Did it all without a label
Money calling got the money calling like an alcoholic, I'm an addict
My niggas with me automatic
I was never going static
Blame the money and the status
Turned a nigga to a savage
Turned a nigga to a beast
Competition get deceased
Blessings on me nigga, sheesh
Young nigga better preach
Balmains on the feet
Grindin' seven days a week

Bless, bless, bless
Hallelujah, thank God, amen

Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-feelin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everything champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

I'm in the Benzo (skrr, skrr)
I smell like a check tho
This what they mad for?
Look how the neck glow
I'm with the lit gang
You with them lame lames
Four, three, two, one, call it a ball game
Counting blessings, since an adolescent, I've been really destined for the greatest
I just give 'em motivation
I be speaking revelation
Nigga started in the basement
I handle bars like a waitress
People tell me I'm the chosen, gotta keep it focused, runnin' outta patience
HN on the logo
Real ones, no pretendo
No games, no nintendo
Don't you open up the window
God damn, I'm fresh
God damn, she sexy
You for certain that she yours?
I bet tomorrow she text me

Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-feelin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everything champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

Devil get off me
