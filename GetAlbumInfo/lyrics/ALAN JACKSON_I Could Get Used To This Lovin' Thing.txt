I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing

I've had romance a time or two
Infatuation, then I found you
I've had 'em steal my heart and run
And that ain't fun for anyone

I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing

I like the way you make me feel
And what I feel, feels like it's real
I never once said I love you
Until I felt the one that's true

I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing

Yeah, I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing

I could get used to you everyday
And those tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing
