Say what you want but I swear it don't matter
When I walk in the club there ain't nobody badder
See the truth about me your girls a go getter
When you watch me move it don't get no better

Fresh out of the box I'm selling a mill
Some people dream it but i do this for real
I do this for sport like I'm ballin on court
You don't want it I promise
You'll see my body contort

Nobody keep your head bobbin quite like me
On the dance floor rock your body like me
Show you how to do it better get like me
So whats it gonna be Whats it gonna be

Let me see you walk it out
Wa-walk it out
Wa-walk it out lets go
Let me see you walk it out
Don't talk it out just walk it out
Lets go

Stop all the talk I'm ain't with all the chatter
What you call competition I just greet it with laughter
Complicate like chess but you're more like some checkards
Imma give you some help and let you dance to my records

Imma lay in the cut while you spinnin' ya wheels
Don't tell me thats all you got I can do that in heels
20 years worth of trainin' been dancing since I was born
All I need is a mic and stage and watch my body perform

Nobody keep your head bobbin quite like me
On the dance floor rock your body like me
Show you how to do it better get like me
So whats it gonna be Whats it gonna be

Let me see you walk it out
Wa-walk it out
Wa-walk it out lets go
Let me see you walk it out
Don't talk it out just walk it out
Lets go

WALK...!!
