Itâs finally here, todays the day, I had a 12 point buck 50 yards away.
But I got a different kinda huntin on my mind, I got my baby up in my deer blind. 

Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, girl youâre lookin fine,
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.

I dreamed about it, waited all year, forgot it all when you whispered in my ear.
Iâm lost for words, what can I say? I never knew they made Mossy Oak negligee

Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, girl youâre lookin fine,
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.

Well, that old game warden, he better steer clear, there ainât no poachin goin on up here.
Its warm and cozy, and the stars are bright above,
Donât knock it till you try a little redneck love

Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, and girl youâre lookin fine, 
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
