Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news 
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues 
My baby's gone, I have no friends 
To wish me greetings once again 

Choirs will be singing Silent Night 
Christmas carols, by candle light 
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Years night

Friends and relations, send salutations 
Sure as the stars shine above 
But this is Christmas
Yeah, it's Christmas my dear 
It's the time of year to be with, with the one you love 

So won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow 
No grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, happy, once again
Interlude 

Ooo, there'll be no more sorrow 
No grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, Christmas, once again
