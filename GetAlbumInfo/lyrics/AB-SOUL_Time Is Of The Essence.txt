<i>[Intro]</i>
Fucking wisdom tooth hurt
Awww maaaan <i>[laughs]</i>
<i>[Female Voice]</i> "Time flies when you're having fun"

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
I can't even let it breath
I ain't got a second to spare
But I'm definitely hair, like fur
Do you concur?
I'm only the seed of Herbert the Third
And the creature conceived in Korea
Word
More of a reason to be a overseer
Four years older than Helina, man we're getting old
In four years your be a senior, at least I hope
And hope is all a nigga got
You put your all in something, then that's all you've got
So why would that lollygag
Popping four fives, pop a tag
There's more to life
I know my wrongs, I know my rights
And while you jog, I travel at the speed of light
I see the light, shades on
You got an Audemars with diamonds in the face, huh

<i>[Hook]</i>
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
Question, how many milliseconds in a year?
31,558,468,000 and yeah, I googled it
But which one of you would have counted?
I thought it was astounding
My biggest fear is blinking and missing a whole year and thinking I was tripping
Now that's a disappearing act for your ass
Wesley and Sanaa didn't have it that bad
My mind travel so fast that I can see the future today
Trying to escape like a fugitive in 2088, play it safe
Preparate, you still trying to segregate
You better be trying to get your ticket on them arks they about to make
Know or be amazed, you caught in a maze
You need your hair done, you need the brand new Js
You need your nails done and you need 28s
So you can skate on them hoes, fuck if they say no, there's plenty more

<i>[Hook]</i>
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested

<i>[Female Voice]</i> "Time Flies when your having fun"

Time <i>[x3]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Punch]</i>
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of time
I'm Francis Ford Coppola
The writer of Apocalypse Now is upon us
I guess time is the opponent
With Armageddon approaching, I'm striving to be the dopest
Instead of getting prepared, I'm focused on hypnosis
With the flow, yeah I know how close it is
I'd rather match with Soul about who the coldest is
And carry on like I don't notice this
Sprinkle jewels here and there while committing the grossest sins
Infinite living just isn't consistent with our comprehension
Everything we know has an ending
Analyze time, it means limits, I never knew them
I'm throwing shots back, the world spinning
4026 before our common era man was made
In 2012 we live in terror
Cause time is of the essence
We ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Yeah, said Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
I hope my intellect is manifested

There's so much more I want to say but there's just not enough time

Time <i>[x4]</i>
