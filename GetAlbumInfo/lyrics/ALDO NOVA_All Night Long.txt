Feel the fire
Burning outta control
It's a flaming desire
But don't you call it love

It's gotta hold on me
Never wanna let it go
Well, over here, little girl
There's something you ought to know
Oh yeah, baby

All right
Just wanna let you know
Tonight
I only wanna hold you

Tighter and tighter
Than you've ever been held before
Until you feel the fire
Of this burning love, yeah

Well, over here, little girl
Come on and let it show
'Cause we got the night
Never let it go
Oh yeah, baby

All right
Just wanna let you know
Tonight
I only wanna love you

All night long
So come on, just wanna love you
All night long
Hold on, just wanna love you
Really wanna love you tonight

So hold tight
Tonight
Hold tight
My baby

All night long
So come on, just wanna love you
All night long
Hold on, just wanna love you
Really wanna love you tonight

So hold tight
Tonight
Hold tight
My baby

All night
I just wanna love you
Hold tight
'Cause I really wanna love you

All night
And, baby, if you want to
Hold tight
I'm really gonna love you

All night
Oh yeah, baby, baby
Hold tight
