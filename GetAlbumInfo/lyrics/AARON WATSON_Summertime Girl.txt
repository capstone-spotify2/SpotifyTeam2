Donât you know life is kinda crazy, what are the chances that Iâd see you here.
I think about you round this time every year.
Racin down this Texas highway, chasing after dreams of love, I thought I had it all.
Dancing with you down at Gruene Hall. I smile when I think about

You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldnât keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but youâll always be my Summertime Girl. 

Our little town was lazy, there wasnât much to do to pass the time, so we got bored and stole that county road sign.
Just like you did with my heart, you stole it away and tore it apart,
left it shot full of holes, girl I guess thatâs the way it goes, Lord knows we had a good run

You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldnât keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but youâll always be my Summertime Girl. 

I thought my heart would stop, yeah I thought my life would end, when you said goodbye, to my surprise, the sun came up again.
And when those bluebonnets bloom, it reminds me of you down on that riverwalk.
On that forth of July let those fireworks fly. With willie and the boys, Down in Luckenbach 

You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldnât keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but youâll always be my Summertime Girl. 

Youâll always be my Summertime Girl.
