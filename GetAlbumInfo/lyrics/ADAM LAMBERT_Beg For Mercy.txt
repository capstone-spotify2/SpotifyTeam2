Whoa oh-ho-oh
Whoa oh-ho-oh

The stars collide
They fall to earth alive
As my hunger hides
Desires that are burning

Ready to land
I shall overcome
And when you're numb
A deeper breath goes out

Whoa oh-ho-oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
Yeah-eh eh-yeah
Come to settle the score

The strength inside
The lightning and the thunder
Taking shape won't hide
Enlightening you to wonder
The heart, the pulse
Is racing towards the line
As every beat and sound
Go tricklin' down the vine

I'll make you beg for mercy
We rule the sun
We rule the sun
Yeah-eh eh-yeah
I'll make you beg for mercy
Come to settle the score
Whoa oh-ho-oh

My adrenaline is pumpin'
Yeah-eh eh-yeah
I've got it next to nothing
Whoa oh-ho-oh
Come to settle the score

Whoa oh-ho-oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
Whoa oh-ho-oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
Yeah-eh eh-yeah
Come to settle the score

Whoa oh-ho-oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
We rule the sun
We rule the sun
I'll make you beg for mercy
We rule the sun
We rule the sun
