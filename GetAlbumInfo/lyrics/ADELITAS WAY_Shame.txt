Shame, shame,
She ain't got no shame,
She's runnin' around this little town,
She just likes to play,

Games, Games,
She likes playing games,
She gets me high,
And takes me down,

She ain't got no shame,
I'll put your picture in my hall of fame,
You are my memory on your wall of shame,
I'm just losing your wondergame,

Shame, shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
Shame,
She ain't got no shame,
Tame, tame,
She's so hard to tame,
She's coming now,
She's on the prowl,
And you can't get away,

Say, say,
How much will I pay?,
My sanity, my vanity?,
'Cuz she ain't got no shame,
I'll put your picture in my hall of fame,
You are my memory on your wall of shame,
I'm just losing your wondergame,

Shame, shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
I wanna see you only,
I'd rather be with you than lonely,

Yeah,
Even if you say that you won't be my only,
I'll put your picture in my hall of fame,
You are my memory on your wall of shame,
I'm just losing your wondergame,

Shame, shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
Shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
Shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
Shame,
She' ain't got no shame,
Shame,
She' ain't got no shame.
