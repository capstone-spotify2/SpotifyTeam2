Theyâre saying Iâve been away for to long
Cause Iâve been rocking alone
Taking my time watching the throne
Acting like they didnât know
Guarding my body, feeding my mind,
Giving my demons no time.
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Name in the news but I wonât sing along,
That ainât the words to my song.
Never been dropped, I hit the road
So donât worry bout whoâs in my home.
Whatâs in my closet? You want to know
Nothing but shoes and these clothes.
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I refuse to lose my mind,
On my way to better time,
Iâll take my time.
Cause Iâm strong,
Iâll go on, Iâll be fine.
Iâm getting stronger,
Stressing no longer.
Yes Iâll be fine, Iâll be fine.

Donât call it lucky when youâve done the time,
Playing it down is a crime.
I put in work, heels in the dirt,
Till I get what I deserve.
Until I get whateverâs mine
I gotta shine
open the heavens and send down these angels of mine
To keep the peace in my mind.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I refuse to lose my mind,
On my way to better time,
Iâll take my times.
Cause Iâm strong,
Iâll go on, Iâll be fine.
Iâm getting stronger,
Stressing no longer.
Yes Iâll be fine, Iâll be fine.

Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Ainât that right, ainât that right, 
Iâm getting stronger,
Stressing no longer.
Iâll be fine, Iâll be fine.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I refuse to lose my mind,
On my way to better time,
Iâll take my times.
Cause Iâm strong,
Iâll go on, Iâll be fine.
Iâm getting stronger,
Stressing no longer.
Yes Iâll be fine, Iâll be fine.

I refuse to lose my mind,
On my way to paradise.

Iâm on way to paradise
