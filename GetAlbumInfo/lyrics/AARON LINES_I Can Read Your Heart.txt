Well, I don't claim to know everything
But some things aren't hard to figure out
I can tell your love for me has been fading
And I know what you want to talk about

Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart

I felt it skip a beat on the night we met
Moving cautiously at first, then letting go
Yeah, with each passing day, I turn another page
So there ain't much I don't already know

Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart

Well, I knew this day was coming
It was there between the lines
Still I was hoping maybe I could change your mind
But that's not gonna happen
No way upon this earth
So just kiss me on last time, but don't say a word

Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart

So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
I can read your heart
