Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee by-way,
One arm on the wheel.
Holdin' my lover with the other,
A sweet, soft, southern thrill.
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle,
On a Tennessee Saturday night.
Couldn't feel better, I'm together,
With my Dixieland Delight.

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler,
'Neath the mountain moonlight.
Hold her up tight,
Make a little lovin',
A little turtle dovin'.
On a Mason-Dixon night.
Fits my life, oh so right,
My Dixieland Delight.

White-tail buck deer, munchin' on clover,
Red-tail hawk sittin' on a limb.
A chubby old groundhog, croakin' bullfrog,
Free as the feelin' in the wind.
Home grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl,
On a Tennessee Saturday night.
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven,
With my Dixieland Delight.

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler,
'Neath the mountain moonlight.
Hold her up tight, make a little lovin',
A little turtle dovin'.
On a Mason-Dixon night.
Fits my life, oh so right,
My Dixieland Delight.

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler,
'Neath the mountain moonlight.
Hold her up tight, make a little lovin',
A little turtle dovin'.
On a Mason-Dixon night.
Fits my life, oh so right,
My Dixieland Delight.

Rollin' down a backwoods Tennessee by way,
One arm on the wheel.
Holdin' my lover...
