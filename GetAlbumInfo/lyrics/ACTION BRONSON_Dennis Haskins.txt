All my bitches adore me
No more visits to Maury
Only visits to where the shore be
Fuck having a shorty
I'm on tour, I need my dick milked
Blow my nose in patterns woven into thick silk
Ah shit motherfucker man I been ill
Spin wheel my favorite disc consists of thin veal
Mmm daddy look good, that's what your bitch feel
Then spread her thighs wide open for a kid's meal (fish)
What a bitch, here's the twist
What I twist'll make a normal human twitch
Catch me in the Saab like Mitch
Pitch left-handed with the chip wrist
Bring Mr. Belding out, that means you gettin' dismissed
Cancelled, flicks with mickey on the mantle
Flicks with Yogi Berra lifted in some sandals
Smoke the wax like a candle
It be that shit you can't handle
Look just like doodoo in the pamper
Like when my son drinks too much apple juice, loose
When he was four he got his dick sucked by a prostitute
Right in the pasta chute
A piece of knife, a little gun hang out the mobster's booth
We gettin' lots of loot
I lift him off his feet, cop a Porsche for cheap
Fuck around, you'll be layin' in the coffin sleep
At the large round table where the bosses meet
Come correct motherfucker you know that talk is cheap
Lift him off his feet, drop a Porsche or Jeep
Fuck around, you'll be layin' in the coffin sleep
At the large round table where the bosses meet
Come correct motherfucker you know that talk is cheap
