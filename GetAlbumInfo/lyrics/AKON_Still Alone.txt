Shortie (I've been) tryna feel you out,
Let me know what's goin on,
Seems to me that you aint got no man,
Cuz the (love) is always gone,
but you keep on tryin to brush me off,
and then you find yourself callin me,
but you don't wanna jeopardize what you got,
even though you would rather be with me

you got a man, he never home,
pretty little thing cryin on the phone
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

you got a man, he never home,
only stuck around cuz your love was strong
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

day by day keep passin you by, got you feelin like you sittin on a passenger side,
at the booty club getting drunk and high, while your home all alone, cryin wonderin why,
oh no, girl I cant have that,
too cute to be havin an attitude and all that,
when your fallin down I be the one to grab at,
and when your on your feet you go right back yeah...

you got a man, he never home,
pretty little thing cryin on the phone
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

you got a man, he never home,
only stuck around cuz your love was strong
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

cuz I got nothing to lose and nothing to gain,
got to make up your mind if you want me on your team,
you don't want me to stay, you don't want me to leave,
but you wanna hug me up until a brother cant breath

like what do you want from me
say you wanna love me but your mans in the way
still what do you want from me
I guess I cut it up again and call it a day cuz

you got a man, he never home,
pretty little thing cryin on the phone
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

you got a man, he never home,
only stuck around cuz your love was strong
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

you got a man, he never home,
pretty little thing cryin on the phone
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone

you got a man, he never home,
only stuck around cuz your love was strong
city lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
