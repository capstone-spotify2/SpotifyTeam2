Highball women that are, hot to touch
Legs do the talking, spelling out the lust
See the sugar daddies with a sweet tooth and smile
See what's hanging off him like a, wanting child
That's where you'll find me, standing proud

Playing with girls, gonna get you hot
Playing with guns, gonna get you shot
Playing with fire, gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

Bring on the showgirls and the, debutantes
Late night waitress in a, restaurant
Heading for the clubs and bars, with the flashing lights
Looking for the good time girls in their black nylon tights
Over the barrel, bottoms up

Playing with girls, gonna get you hot
Playing with guns, gonna get you shot
Playing with fire, gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

River run dry, yeah yeah playing with fire
Wild sweet child
Playing with girls, playing with girls

Playing, playing, playing with girls, playing with girls

I like tall girls but I'll take em small
I want em all up front, I like em all
I wanna see em' strut their stuff
And lose their social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace
That's where you'll find me, standing proud

Playing with girls, playing with girls
Playing with girls, playing with girls
You got the long girl, short girl
Nothing but the bad girl
Just playing with girls

I want all the women in the world
