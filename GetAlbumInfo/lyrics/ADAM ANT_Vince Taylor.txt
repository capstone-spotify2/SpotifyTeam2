Johnny looked back
You know he never looked back
The whole world was his stage
He never acted his age

A girl we call French Valerie
Gave a gold plate chain to me
Asked her who had given it her
An old flame called Vince Taylor

I nearly done a Vince Taylor

Oh, Johnny looked back
You know he never looked back
Leather and chains, so damned vain
Never seen his like again
Must have left his mark on me
Even liked by Morrissey

Johnny looked back
You know he never looked back

Leather and chains
The whole world was his stage
He never acted his age

A girl we call French Valerie
Gave a gold plate chain to me
Asked her who had given it her
An old flame called Vince Taylor

Leather and chains
Goddamn vain
We'll never see his like again

Johnny looked back
You know he never looked back
The whole world was his stage
He never acted his age

A girl called French Valerie
Gave a gold plate chain to me
Asked her who had given it her
An old flame named Vince Taylor

I nearly done a Vince Taylor
I nearly done a Vince Taylor
I nearly done a Vince Taylor
I nearly done a Vince Taylor
I nearly done a Vince Taylor
I nearly done a Vince Taylor
