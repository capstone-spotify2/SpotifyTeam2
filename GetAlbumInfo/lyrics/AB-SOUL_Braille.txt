Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

(Turn it up a lil more, uh, uh, yeah)
Soulo Ho the prophet
I'm a fiend like Bassy
Money like I'm Saudi, agua from the islands
We went from Pintos to Benzos
Plain and simple, let's race a little
The bar needs to be raised a little
I led the way, but never raised the pencil
Might pay your rent if you suck good dick
And you know what our time apart meant
Pardon me, if I'm arguably
The hardest nigga on the beat
Me and Bas is bosses, throwin' their boxers
I can own fifty dollar boxers
I just wanna spend hunnid stacks everyday
I went digital
Yo shit we don't dig at all, we just dish if off
You know I gotta eat
My bitch got cakes and I'm getting that brain
That's food for thought
Uhh, got the loud and it's lit
Got the loud and it's lit
You smoking that reggie, you niggas ain't ready
Be quiet and quit

Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

Bassy on a mission
Stackin' dough like it's a photo moment
Haters hate us only for the moment
'Cause your bitch wanna take a photo, homie
Soulo rollin', got an onion on us
Where my city dolo like Vanilla Sky
Smoking like we 'bout to cross the border
Got a couple shows up on the other side
25 in a row, shit
Shows jumping we've been hittin' licks
Money flowin' like we flippin' bricks
Now I don't know if I've ever been in this town
Flip a switch, killing niggas like I pulled the plug
Quarter pound of piff to fill the lungs
Got the whole crowd yelling, "Feel the buzz," it's lit
I call her, one DM
I land around noon, but I fuck by 1PM, FIENDS
Practice what you preach, preach love
Careful what you eat, half of it's diseased
They don't want us here

You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

What the tongue can't taste
What the eyes can't see
What the ear can't hear
What your nose can't sniff
Put your hands in the air
P-put your hands in the air
What the tongue can't taste
What the eyes can't see
What the ear can't hear
What your nose can't sniff
P-put your hands in the air
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

Peter Piper picked the pack of pickled peppers
Soulo found a pound of loud and lit it up
Bet this resin never leave my finger tips
Helen Keller would've felt the shit
But tell me what is it you niggas wan't
Really, tell me what is it you niggas wan't
Are you niggas dope or you just doin' dope?
Is you niggas dope or you just doin' dope?
