Way out in a haunted hollow
A strange chill on a ghostly lake
Dark shadows in a twilight haze
A lost cabin in a tree lined maze

Nightly apparitions... lost destinations
Victims calling from beyond the grave

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And now... Now they walk the night
Searching for the light... One step beyond
Beyond the shades of death (shades of death)

The darkest shades of death (shades of death)
Beyond the shades

Tied... tied to the devil's chair... a sinister affair
Terror's drawing near... out on the streets of fear

Eyes shine in the black of the night
Somethings moving but it's out of sight
Cryptic symbols in an Indian cave
A hitchhiker take you to your grave
A presence in the air... feelings of dispair
Footsteps walking in the leaves behind you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And now... Now they walk the night
Searching for the light... one step beyond
The darkest shades of death (shades of death)
Beyond the shades of death (shades of death)
The darkest shades

Cursed... there's a curse on the ground...
Terror's drawing near
A dark force all around... out on the streets of fear

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Narrative:]</i>
Legend states that there were numerous deaths and unsolved killings in the dark depths near "Shades of Death"
Murders plagued the area and souls are said to walk this long lonely path

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And now... and now they walk the night
Searching for the light... one step beyond
Beyond the darkest shades of death (shades of death)
Beyond the shades of death (shades of death)
Beyond the shades of death (shades of death)
The darkest shades of death (shades of death)
Beyond the darkest shades of death
