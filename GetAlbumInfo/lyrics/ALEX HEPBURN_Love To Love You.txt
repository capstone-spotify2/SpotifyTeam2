Sometimes it's hard to breathe
When I look into your eyes I just can't believe
That you're mine all mind and soul
My home is where my heart is
And where I belong

No tears in the poring rain
Every rise is like a bright sunny day

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
That I love to love you
That I love to love you

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
There's no one above you
Won't you let me
Won't you let me
Cause I love to love you

And when you're holding me
For every kiss I miss
I skip a heart beat
And there ain't nothing
Nothing that I won't do
To save this feeling I'm so lost in you

No tears in the poring rain
Every rise is like a bright sunny day

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
That I love to love you
That I love to love you

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
There's no one above you
Won't you let me
Won't you let me
Cause I love to love you

So don't go giving up
No matter what you do
Cause I feel for you honey
Yes I feel for you baby
Don't go giving up
No matter how hard it gets
Cause I'll never leave you
Baby I just need you to know

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
That I love to love you
Won't you let me love you

Did I did I did I
Ever tell you
There's no one above you
Won't you let me
Won't you let me
Cause I love to love you
