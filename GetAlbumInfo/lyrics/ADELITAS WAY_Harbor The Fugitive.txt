Go and have her for you,
Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
She'll break your heart,

Nothing that she said,
Ever made no sense to you now,
Oh she's never gonna change,
Every time she moves,
Got too much to lose when she's out,
Oh it's just bought out of her game now,
Hide your lie,
Now she's gone it's moved,
You don't try,
Not going well,
Hold on tight,
She's gonna take you to the end,
She's up and gone again,

Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
I'm in love,
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe,

She'll break your heart, (break your heart)
She'll break your,

Everything she said,
Got caught in the web of your lies,
Oh it's just another day now,
'Cause of you,
I can barely choose if I tried,
Oh I'm just another name now,
Hide your lie,
Crush now gone it's moved,
You don't try,
Not feeling well,
Hold on tight,
She's gonna take you for a ride,
Now your outta time,

Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
I'm in love,
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe,

(She'll break your heart)
(She'll break your)

Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
I'm in love,
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe, 
Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
I'm in love,
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe,
Go and have her for you,
She'll break your heart,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
I'm in love,
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe,
Go and have her for you,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
(I'm in love)
Go and have her for you then,
'Cause she's the one reason I'm chained on love babe,
Go and have her for you,
Go and harbor the fugitive,
(I'm in love)
Go and have her for you then.
