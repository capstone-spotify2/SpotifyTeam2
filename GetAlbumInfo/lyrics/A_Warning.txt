It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go

Save it for the Jury, 'cause I don't care anymore
You're not even worthy

It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go

I don't even know you, I don't even want to know
'Cause I think you're mental

It's a warning, that's as far as we go 
Warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go.... go....go
Thats As Far As We Go
