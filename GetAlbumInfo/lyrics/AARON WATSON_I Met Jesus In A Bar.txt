I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar

Man or angel, son of God he did not tell me who he was (but I knew)
In that least expected place I saw heaven in His face and couldn't move
We sat there for hours, I could feel His grace and power
and I said things I'd never told a soul
I asked for forgiveness, he said I've already done this don't you know?

I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar

I started cryin' in my hands when I looked up again, He was gone
Then I walked the whole way home for the first time knowin' I was not alone
Some meet Him on the highway, some meet Him on a Sunday on the back row of the church
But I can only tell you my way was in a place where people go to hurt

I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar

I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar
