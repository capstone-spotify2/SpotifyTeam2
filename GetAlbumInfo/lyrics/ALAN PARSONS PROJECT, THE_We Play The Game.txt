You Drink The Wine
You Play The Fool
You Cross The Line
You Lose Your Cool
But No One Cares
Still No One Cares

You Raise The Bar
Lost In A Trance
One Bridge Too Far
No Second Chance
But No One Cares
Still No One Cares

We Play The Game
We Hold Our Own
We Fight To Win
We Stand Alone

You Had A Dream
You Cast The Dice
Your Shady Scheme
You Paid The Price
But No One Cares
Still No One Cares

We Play The Game
With Hearts Of Stone
You Lose Again
You're On Your Own

A Turning Tide
A Streak Of Light
Arms Open Wide
The End's In Sight
And Someone Cares
Yes Someone Cares

We Play The Game
We Hold Our Own
We Fight To Win
We Stand Alone
