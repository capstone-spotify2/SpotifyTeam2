Great when you call us
Thank you for staying with us
We missed you all so desperately
But don't blink or you'll miss me
On a street like this as it were
From the thick of Jerusalem
Is what makes you love old England
The roots of freedom are here
Say what you will about the Alien
Just dig in and start with the sky
He's welcome and ever may be so
And then somehow everything seems
To come out right
So let's hear it for
Let's hear it for
Let's hear it for
The Alien
You're such a killer
But oh just you trade that in
For tea and Jammie Dodgers
Down the prospect and sing
On a street like this as it were
From the thick of Jerusalem
Is what makes you love old England
The roots of freedom are here
Say what you will about the Alien
Just dig in and start with the sky
He's welcome and ever may be so
And then somehow everything seems
To come out right
So let's hear it for
Let's hear it for
Let's hear it for
The Alien
