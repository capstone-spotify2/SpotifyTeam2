Days go by
Adrift upon a rolling sky
The miracles escape my eyes
But I still hope

Time, regret
Is this as good as life can get?
It's only when the spirit sets me free I cope

If I seek in every corner
If I search in every doorway
When the water turns to wine will I believe?
If I navigate the river
Would you take me to your island?
Sing s siren song so I can never leave

Long and wide
Eternity from side to side
Lead me through the rapids
guide me to the shore

There's a place
That's far beyond this time and space
When each of us comes face to face with something more

If I open up the channel
Would you send me information
If you tune me to your station I'll receive
If I navigate the river
Would you take me to your island
Sing s siren song so I can never leave

Plans can fail
But only fail to understand
The pyramid will turn to sand and I'll be here
... I will be here
