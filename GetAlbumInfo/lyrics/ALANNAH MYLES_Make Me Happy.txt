Nothin' in your pocket, something up your sleeve
You look right up my alley, coming down my street
The gun goes off at midnight, whistle blows at dawn
Give me half the morning and we'll carry on

Straight from your hip, make a backbone slip
Right in front of my eyes like a sweet surprise - hey hey hey-yeah

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Bet you're gonna find a little foolin' on your mind
Soon you're gonna feel a little tuggin' on your line
Bet you're gonna be a little nervous boy
Run for cover and jump for joy

You make me happy without even trying, you make me happy every time, oh yeah

Gotta roll with the punch, stagger with the kiss
Follow what you feel on a night like this
Gotta raise up your flag, holler in the street
Someone's throwing roses all around your feet

Straight from your lips, you're gonna let it slip
It's there in your eyes so don't apologize - hey hey hey-yeah

<i>[chorus]</i>

You make me happy without even trying, you make me happy every time, oh yeah

<i>[Solo]</i>

Hey hey hey-yeah

Bet you're gonna find a little foolin' on your mind
Soon you're gonna feel a little tuggin' on your line
Bet you're gonna be a little nervous boy, oh

You make me happy every time, you make me happy without even trying
You make me happy every time, oh yeah...
