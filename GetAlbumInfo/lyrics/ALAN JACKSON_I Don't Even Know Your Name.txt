Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me, I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress, mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee, but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you, baby, and I don't even know your name

I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you, baby, and I don't even know your name

So I ordered straight tequila, a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted, yeah, I went a little far
I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I'm in love with you, baby, and I don't even know your name

I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you, baby, and I don't even know your name

The next thing I remember, I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the hell am I and just who the hell are you?
She said, I was your waitress and our last name's now the same
'Cause I'm married to you, baby, and I don't even know your name

Yeah, I'm married to a waitress, I don't even know her name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Hey, I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name
