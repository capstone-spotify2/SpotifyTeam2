So now your pictures worth a thousand words, 
you meant so much to me it hurts. 
This tattoo on my wrist, 
this feeling cant be missed. 
You meant so much to make things worse. 

Get ready for the impact, 
I promise you won't feel a thing tonight. 
Get ready for the angels 
to come and take away your pain and sight 
at the moment of passing. 

I know that memories never die. (I will never die)
So this is my angel 
and I know my scars won't heal tonight (I will heal tonight)
âcause theyâre paid for, paid for.

Get ready for the ending, 
I promise you won't feel the earth tonight. 
And this is for the mending, 
to heal the hearts of the friends you left alive 
at the moment of passing. 

I know that memories never die. (I will never die)
So this is my angel 
and I know my scars won't heal tonight (I will heal tonight)
âcause theyâre paid for, paid for.

This is my tribute to your life. 

In this moment, 
this violent careless moment (Make my dreams come true) 
this violent careless moment (Make my dreams come true) 
this violent careless moment (Make my dreams come true) 

I make believe that youâre still here. 
I'll see you out tonight. 
I hold you close and hold you dear, 
keep you by my side. 

Forever and a lifetime, 
just a blink and youâre gone. I wish youâd stay. 
And this is for your moment, 
I finally get to say goodbye the right way, 
while everyoneâs listening.

I know that memories never die. (I will never die)
So this is my angel 
and I know my scars won't heal tonight (I will heal tonight)
âcause theyâre paid for, paid for.
