Things I like to think about involving me and you
Include a wait for a proposal underneath a London cloud
We make choices and they take us closer to our future
And the day I wake up next to you completely safe and sound

Maybe we can spend a little time, growing old and drinking wine
Looking forward to the things we've yet to face
And if they bring us pearls for us to wear on Judgement Day
We can think ourselves quite lucky that we haven't worn away

I want to know if this could be something that you could believe in
Or am I just saying words again

I remember how we were, before you became intoxicating
I remember how we were, before I could feel my will escaping
I remember how we were, before my mind was inundated
With wishes of you getting lost in me

Things I have to think about when I don't know if you will do
Your best to make this work or if you won't reciprocate
I could stand in front of you and offer you my world
But if you're not quite ready yet than you will leave me lost in space

Maybe we can spend a couple days, high on life and cheap champagne
Dancing as we discuss possibility
And if hypothetically the two of us become more strange
I'll think myself quite lucky you don't throw my hand away

I want to know if this could be something that you could believe in
Or am I just saying words again

I remember how we were, before you became intoxicating
I remember how we were, before I could feel my will escaping
I remember how we were, before my mind was inundated
With wishes of you getting lost in me
