I'm in way over my head,
Can't find the sunset over me
The mirror in front of my bed
Sees the one I said I'd never be
Try to escape from the storms,
Spinning over like a hurricane
Can't get away in the dark

'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!

The stolen innocence weights on my shoulders
It's heavy now
These broken nights we spend
They shine through the cracks till they way out
Try to escape from the storms,
Spinning over like a hurricane
Can't get away in the dark

'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!

'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only gravity can hold us down
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run!
