It wasn't the rain that washed away...
Rinsed out the colours of your eyes
Putting the gun down on the bedside table
I must have realized

It wasn't the rain 
That made no difference
And I could have sworn it wasn't me
Yet I did it all so coldly
...almost slowly
Plain for all to see

Oh c'mon please now
Talk to me 
Tell me; things I could find helpful
How can I stop now...
Is there nothing I can do
I have lost my way
I've been losing you

I can still hear our screams competing
You're hissing your s's like a snake
Now in the mirror stands
Half a man
I thought no one could break 

It wasn't the rain
That made no difference
...nervously drumming on:Run away
But I want the guilt to get me
Thoughts to wreck me
Preying on my mind

So, please now
Talk to me
Tell me; things I could find helpful
For how can I stop now...
Is there nothing I can do
I have lost my way
I've been losing you
