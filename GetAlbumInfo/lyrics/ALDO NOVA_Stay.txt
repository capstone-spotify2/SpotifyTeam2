So now I stay wondering,
Our backs against the wall.
Two hearts made for a lover,
Now ones about to fall.

What happen to the love we had?
Did we turn around and let it slip away?
You know I think it's sad, 
The way she left and leave it this way.

Making you go.
Leave me tonight.
Leave me in love,
Because I'm asking you to stay.
Don't, Leave me alone.
Don't walk away
Because I'm begging you to stay tonight.

So turn around and face it baby.
Just listen to your heart.
It's the only thing that doesn't matter.
And now's a time to start.

We make the world spin in our heads.
And we stop it with the things being said.
Come on, let's give it one more chance.
To make our love last one more day.

Making you go.
Leave me tonight.
Leave me in love,
Because I'm asking you to stay.
Don't, Leave me alone.
Don't walk away
Because I'm begging you to stay tonight.

You hear me counting the nights?
I do.
I push, and I shove, and I fight.
To get you back into our lives.

Do You leave me tonight, oh no.
I'm begging you to stay.

Go. (Go)
Leave me tonight. (Leave me tonight)
Leave me in love, 
Because I'm asking you to stay.
Go. (Go)
Don't, Leave me alone. (Leave me alone)
Don't walk away
Because I'm begging you to stay tonight.

Won't you stay the night.
Stay the night.
Stay the night.
