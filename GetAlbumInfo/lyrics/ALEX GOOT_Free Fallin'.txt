She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too

It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart

And I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin', fallin'

All the vampires walkin' through the valley
And move west down Ventura Blvd.
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
All the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin', fallin'

Now I'm free fallin', 
now I'm free fallin'
Now I'm, free fallin', 
now I'm free fallin'
Now I'm free fallin', 
now I'm free fallin'
Now I'm, free fallin', 
now I'm free fallin'

I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
I'm gonna leave this world for awhile

And I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'...
