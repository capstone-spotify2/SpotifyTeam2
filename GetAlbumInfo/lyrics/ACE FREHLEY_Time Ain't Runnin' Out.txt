Monday mornin'
The sun wasn't out
You Were lazy
The fight last night
It didn't set right
I was hazy
But you were cool, actin' like nothin' had happened

Time ain't runnin' out
You hurt me for the last time
(and) Time ain't runnin' out
(cuz) I'm leavin'

The thing with the stare
It just wasn't fair
You rubbed it in my face
And how do I know
When i'm not around
He's not takin' my place
I'm done with abuse
Knowing you'll never admit it to me

Time ain't runnin' out
You hurt me for the last time
(and) Time ain't runnin' out
(cuz) I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'

Maybe someday, not far away
You'll remember this voice
Ooooohhhh maybe you won't
Maybe you can't
But you were given a choice
I was never so close
But so far away
Do you remember
Do you remember
Could you remember
Remember

Time ain't runnin' out
You hurt me for the last time
(and) Time ain't runnin' out
(cuz) I'm leavin'
