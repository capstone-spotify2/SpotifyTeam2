<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
It's been a long time and it's really getting hard to fight it I know
Cover it up but it's much too hard to hide it is
Hanging around I can't believe I didn't see it coming
I wanna run away but I just can't seem to leave it oh no
I'm going round round nothing down I don't understand
I say no no let it go don't be a fool take no chance

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
How do you know how do you know if it's real and where do you go?
How do you know how do you know if it is please show me the roads?
If it's love then how do you know?
If it's love then how do you know?

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I believe you're an angel down to guide me you are
To one that's always be right here beside me oh please
Tell me that my mind won't go and chance it I'm scared
Promise me you'll be here when we get here oh yeah

I'm going round round nothing down I don't understand
I say no no let it go don't be a fool take no chance

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Understand that love takes more than reason
But I'm finding you'll never understand at all
