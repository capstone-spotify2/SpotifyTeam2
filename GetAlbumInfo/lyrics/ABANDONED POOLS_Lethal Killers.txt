Is it not enough for you 
to be alive
Did you have to create god 
to survive
This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state are lethal killers

If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before

Does it make you feel much better
To stay unaware
Are you living for a heaven
That might not be there
This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state are lethal killers

If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper
And now I'm sure 
that this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before

This is all we have
and all we have is everywhere
This is all we have (Is it not enough for you) to be alive
And all we have is everywhere (to be alive)
This is all we have
and all we have is everywhere
This is all we have (Did you have to create god)
And all we have is everywhere (to survive)

This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state of lethal killers

If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper
And now I'm sure 
that this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before
