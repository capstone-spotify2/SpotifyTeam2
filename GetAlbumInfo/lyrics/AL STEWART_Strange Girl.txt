You're a strange girl, you come from a strange family
You're a strange girl, I don't understand your vanity.

Your mother's taking pills all day, she's looking to escape
Your uncle's in the County Jail for statutory rape
Just another runner never made it to the tape.

Your cousin gets his kicks setting everything on fire
Your little brother always lets the air out of my tyres
Your sister wants to prove that she's an object of desire.

You're a strange girl, you come from a strange family
You're a strange girl, I don't understand your fantasy.

Your father's a collector and his things are a delight
He likes cameras and binoculars and everything in sight
He collects them in a wagon in the middle of the night.

Every holiday's a nightmare and it's giving me the chills
Everybody ends up fighting, I remember it still
The only thing that they agree on is it's me they want to kill.

You're a strange girl, you come from a strange family
You're a strange girl, I don't understand your vanity.

I think we ought to break up, I could really use the rest
Everything I like you say is something you detest
But every time I try to leave you say you love me best.

I was looking for some mystery, I thought you'd be the girl
I really must admit you were like nothing in this world
I finally got the oyster but I never found the pearl.

You're a strange girl, you come from a strange family
You're a strange girl, I don't understand your vanity.

You're a strange girl, you come from a strange family
You're a strange girl, I think you're headed for calamity.

(Strange strange) girl
(Strange strange) girl
(Strange strange) most peculiar!
(Strange strange) girl.
