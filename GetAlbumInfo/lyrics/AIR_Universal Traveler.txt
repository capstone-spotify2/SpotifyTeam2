I know so many places in the world 
I follow the sun in my silver plane 
Universal traveler 

If you have a look 
Outside on the sea 
Everything is white 
It's so wonderful 
Universal traveler 

So far, so far 
So far away 

I met so many 
People in my life 
I've got many friends 
Who can care for me 
Universal traveler 

Just feel everywhere at home 
Tomorrow 
Is a brand new day 
Let's go somewhere else 
Universal Traveler 

So far, so far 
So far away
