Saw the evident potential with both eyes
Could tell it when I met you on the lower side
Getting high ainât fun if you donât float by
Calm these hounding nerves before the show time
And if youâre not in the equation it donât sound good
Had to climb a high mountain before I found you
Youâre the root of my talents from the ground up
They could love you like I do the whole town could

Colors in the sky
When youâre by my side
Love to see you laugh
Hate to say goodbye
But these colors in the sky
Remind me that youâre mine
You know Iâll see you soon
Keep taking it in stride
Colors in the sky
