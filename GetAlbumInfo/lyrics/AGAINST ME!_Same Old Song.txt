I'm sick of hearing the same old song. The same old heartbreaking story about some poor shit whose life sucks dick thinking he's gonna change the world through another angry song. Well I don't see progress just repetition same old songs about oppression. Another band that will break up in a year because no one in it really cared. Just in it so they could say they tried to their kids when they wonder why, why they let the world get to the point that it is.Yeah we've all tasted oppression but still we stand on division letting fashion taint our vision and thinking that our clothes alone damage the system.

We haven't even made a dent but the system's not going to let us forget that every time we make a stand Whitey smashes us back down again. Yeah I know we all got problems and I don't think that this song's going to solve them. Why can't you find your own inspiration instead of sponging off last year's condensation. It's unfortunate that you've got no solution to the problems of oppression, pollution, abuse, death, self-sacrifice. Sometimes reality is an ugly thing. Oh yes this world is still a mess, but you still have one more complaint to add on to this list. Just one more dead weight to help pull down this sinking ship. 

Same old heartbreaking story.
