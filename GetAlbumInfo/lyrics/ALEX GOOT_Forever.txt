We get so lost in space
When we get back to earth
You'll feel the sand in your toes, in your toes, girl
As we make our way
Watch the crashing waves
And catch a glimpse of the world as we know

We could tame it all
From the full moon's pull
To the falling stars
As we watch it all drop
I think we finally found the spot

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
And we could last forever
We could live the dream
We could play it out just like a movie
I'll make it black and white
So it's plain to see
Tonight you're all I need
And we could last forever

When the summer ends
We could drive out again
Windows down in the sun, in the sun, yeah
As we speed our way
To the only place
We can feel on our own, on our own

We could tame it all
From the full moon's pull
To the falling stars
As we watch it all drop
I think we finally found the spot

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
And we could last forever
We could live the dream
We could play it out just like a movie
I'll make it black and white
So it's plain to see
Tonight you're all I need
And we could last forever
(Woahahahah...)

We could tame it all
From the full moon's pull
To the falling stars
As we watch it all drop
I think we finally found who we are

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
And we could last forever
Like an old time flick
We could play it out just like a movie
I'll make it black and white
So you remember it all
Tonight you're all I see
And we could last forever
