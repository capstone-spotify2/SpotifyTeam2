Live forever burning in the moment 
Turn up all the senses cause we own it 
We are one
We are with the light
We're the sun
Through the darkest night
The truth is in your eyes and now I know it

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Tonight tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight
Tonight tonight

Everything tonight <i>[x5]</i>

You see through our veins the music's racing 
Louder than oblivion defacing
We are one
We are with the light
We're the sun
Through the darkest night
The universe is ours for the taking

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Tonight tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight
Tonight tonight

Everything tonight <i>[x5]</i>

Everything tonight

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Tonight tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight
Tonight tonight

Everything tonight <i>[x5]</i>
