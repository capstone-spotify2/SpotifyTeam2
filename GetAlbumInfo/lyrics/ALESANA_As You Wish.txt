Life is meaningless without you
Love can be such a beautiful torture
My heart breaks as I long for you
Love can be such lovely torture

I will climb the hills, draw my sword and take down
Anyone who tries to stand in front of me
Please know I'll never run away without you in my arms
One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss
Not of Romeo or Juliet
Stories told of our love will never die

I've slain the most unholy things, endured such terrific pain
Finally I'll feel your caress again
I've braved the cold and lonely seas, I have prevailed against the odds
Then again...

I will climb the hills, draw my sword and take down
Anyone who tries to stand in front of me
Please know I'll never run away without you in my arms
One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss
Not of Romeo or Juliet
Stories told of our love will never die

Will you forgive what I've done to give you four white horses?

One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss
Not of Romeo or Juliet
Stories told of our love will never die
