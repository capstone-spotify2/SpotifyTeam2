No point in dreaming if youâre alone
No point in walking without the road
No point in crying without that someone there beside you
Saying it will be OK

Iâll take my time
Iâll take my time
You cannot rush
What canât be timed

And its tough believing
Thereâs someone living out there
Happier than me
Happier than me

We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be

I woke up last night from a dream
That weâd grow old on Bleecker Street
Sit by the fire and Iâd play my guitar
But dreams are only dreams

And then I wonder when we leave
Will the moon still be white
And the river green
Sometimes I wonder if we matter at all
If weâre not written down
Who will remember now

We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be

We may be lost
And gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry
We cry together
Like it was meant to be
