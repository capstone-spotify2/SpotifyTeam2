where am i, what was that
that made my heart beat so fast
i'm somewhere now that i've never been
so far from the world i was living in

baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost

i've come so far, i can't turn back
there was no star, there was no map
well, i followed you to this place
now it's too late, standing here face to face

baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost

it just seems so right to be holding you tight
i never thought it could feel so good to be lost

lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost

well, i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost

baby, i'm lost
