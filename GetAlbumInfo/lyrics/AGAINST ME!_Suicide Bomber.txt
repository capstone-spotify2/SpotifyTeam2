You've been making miles in my prison cell mind
You've been making miles in my prison cell mind
These are such small, small spaces to grow distant in
I don't take deep breaths like I used to
Thank Christ I'm not contagious

You're gigantic to me
The way you bring me closer to death
You're gigantic to me
You're gigantic to me
Become wet in my mouth again
When the rotting is you
You're gigantic to me
I can't take the weight
What more can I do?

I'm clinging tight to your chest, explode me
Like a suicide bomber

You've been making miles in my prison cell mind
You've been making miles in my prison cell mind
So un-ended, so transcendent
There's no expletive could fucking express it
Like a nuclear force, a massacre
Babe, you're a cold-blooded slaughter

You're gigantic to me
The way you bring me closer to death
You're gigantic to me
You're gigantic to me
Become wet in my mouth again
When the rotting is you
You're gigantic to me
I can't take the weight
What more can I do?

I'm clinging tight to your chest, explode me
Like a suicide bomber
I'm clinging tight to your chest, explode me
Like a suicide bomber

You're gigantic to me
The way you bring me closer to death
You're gigantic to me
You're gigantic to me
Become wet in my mouth again
When the rotting is you
You're gigantic to me
I can't take the weight
What more can I do?

I'm clinging tight to your chest, explode me
Like a suicide bomber
I'm clinging tight to your chest, explode me
Like a suicide bomber
