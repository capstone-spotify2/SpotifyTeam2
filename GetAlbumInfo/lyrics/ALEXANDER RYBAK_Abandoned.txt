Sleepless in the night
I try to lose my faith in you
Saying to myself,
"You can't be the right one for me"

And now that you are gone
I finally get a taste of freedom
Only problem is:
I don't really want to be free

I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't want to curse your name
I don't wanna feel the sadness
Pretending that I'm still the same

I don't want to burn your letters
I don't want to face the truth
I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't wanna waste my youth

You tried to suffocate with your pretence
And I believed in this shallow romance
I ran for cover but I couldn't hide
And still you tried to get me to abide

You scratched me like a perfume ad
Erasing all the feelings that I had
And all the time you faked this loneliness
Cause you wouldn't see my twisted mess

I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't want to curse your name
I don't wanna feel the sadness
Pretending that I'm still the same

I don't want to burn your letters
I don't want to face the truth
I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't wanna waste my youth
