Is it too much to ask that you die for the cause? Rather die free than live a life in slavery, Better a martyr than a prisoner. I'll always have what's inside of me. I'll always have my memories. Never surrender identity. Is it too much to ask that you die for the cause? 

Freedom 

All the while my mind's been free. There's places in me they never could reach. Is it too much to ask that I die for the cause? I'd rather die free than live a life in slavery. Is it too much to ask that I die for the cause? Better a martyr than a prisoner. Is it too much to ask that I die for the cause? This anger is sadly a part of me. If that's what it takes then I'll die trying. I'll die for the cause.
