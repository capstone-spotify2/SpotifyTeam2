What was it I was thinking, or was I even thinking at all?
When I think of what I thought back then, then I'm ashamed,
and I'm appalled that I gave up all I was so easily.
Living your life is not for me.
I won't be sedated, I won't be sedated!
Give me a little taste and I know I won't want more.
I won't be sedated, stability is overrated.
Give me the disorder I adore.
What was it you were thinking, or were you even thinking at all?
When I think of what you thought of me, I take offense,
and I'm appalled that you could discount all I love so easily.
Living your life is not for me.
I won't be sedated, I won't be sedated!
Give me a little taste and I know I won't want more.
I won't be sedated, stability is overrated.
Give me the disorder I adore.
I can't be a part, be a part, I can't be a part.
I can't be a part, be a part of your modern world.
I've gotta be apart, be apart, I've gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart. I don't grasp the values that you hold.
I can't be a part, be a part, I can't be a part.
I can't be a part, be a part of your modern world.
I've gotta be apart, be apart, I've gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart. I don't grasp the values that you hold.
I can't be a part, be a part, I can't be a part.
I can't be a part, be a part of your modern world.
I've gotta be apart, be apart, I've gotta be apart.
I've gotta be apart. I don't grasp your values!
