Konvict, Konvict, Konvict

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

'Cause we gon' fight
Oh yes, we gon' fight
(We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight
(We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah
(Right to love, yeah)

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you

Nobody wanna see us together, nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin' things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you, women steady comin' after me
Seems like e'rybody wanna go for self and don't wanna respect boundary

Tellin' you all those lies just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
But just know that I tried to always apologize
And I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you babe)

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you

Got every right to wanna leave, you got every right to wanna go
You got every right to hit the road and never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call, even check for me at all
Because the way I been actin' lately has been off the wall

Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you baby

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
