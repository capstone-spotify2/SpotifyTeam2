It's late at night and no one's around
And only my heart is making a sound
I lay awake alone in my bed
And I can't sleep should I call you instead

I think of you far too much 'cause you, you're one of a kind
I'm not like an open book
'cause I've got something in mind

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
You know I can't deny the way I feel inside
I won't be hiding my love
You know I can't disguise you're always on my mind
And now I can't get enough

Give me love, I know that you can
I like the strength of a confident man
It's in my blood and all through my veins
You feel it once and you're never the same

Whenever I close my eyes you're there. I feel it inside
But why am I holding in my love, I can't tell you why

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

I think of you far too much 'cause you, you're one of a kind
I'm not like an open book 'cause I've got something in mind
You know I , you know I, I can't deny
Every day you're always on my mind
You know I , you know I, I can't disguise
Can't deny the way I feel inside

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
