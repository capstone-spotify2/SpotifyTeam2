I just donât understand how everyone in this world, all of a sudden, got so hard
Could it be me or just does it seem like certain people try and take it too far
I donât know but when the time comes, motherfuckers better show respect
And if they donât then you best believe, this warrior going to shave some heads with a dull hatchet
Ainât no fooling around, Iâll beat the shit out of your bitch and dump shots in your moms house
I got the urge to ball up my fist and start swingin, so since Iâm in a bad mood, bring it

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Whatâs with the attitude?
Whatâs with it, whatâs with it
Whatâs with the attitude?
Everybodyâs entitled to have one
Whatâs with the attitude?
Whatâs with it, whatâs with it
Whatâs with your attitude?
Everybodyâs entitled to have one

Iâm aggravated, feeling depressed, itâs like my hearts beating too damn fast
People in my face makin it muddy from the dirt that they talk and I need to clean it off
Sometimes I need to get away to another place away from all the hate
So I can sit back and relax and try to clear my head
Instead of staying in the hood and leaving bodies for dead
Iâm so damn emotional, and I think that itâs time for me to take control
Instead of fast pace Iâm gonna put it in slow mo,
So you will understand when I say donât test me ho

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Lots of people say Iâm a kind hearted guy
I am but some of yaâll should be terrified
Why, guess it all boils down to trust
Before a motherfucker really starts to self destruct
Attitudes, everyoneâs entitled, but some of yaâll take it to a level thatâs vital
Mood swings, Jekyll and Hyde, aggravated individuals upset with life
Who wants try to calm me down when Iâm in a state of mind that wants to let off rounds
Guess Iâm tired of just playing it cool, so every now and then I get an attitude

<i>[Chorus (til end)]</i>
