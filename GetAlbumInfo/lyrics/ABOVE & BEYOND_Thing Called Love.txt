There was a time, there was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty line to save my face
A parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will the spark cause the bridge to burn
My fear entwined with my regret
I beat a path for safe return

So here we are, we're just the same
And you will never know
My secret plan, how close we came
To share another road

And have I lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside?
Is it just me, I'd like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?

There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget, forget about a thing called LOVE
