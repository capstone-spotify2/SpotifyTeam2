My baby give me a high temperature
My baby give me a high temperature
One hundred and one when we... kiss and dance
One hundred and two for a... night romance
One hundred and three... four and five... it gets to warm to stay alive
My baby give me a high temperature
My baby give me a high temperature
When I see my baby comin'... down the street
I feel a fever get to... high to beat
One hundred and three... four and five... and it gets to warm to stay alive

My baby give me a high temperature
My baby give me a high temperature
Ninety seven... ninety eight is just a... false alarm
My temperature's a hundred and five.. when I hold her in my arms
One hundred and three... four and five... and it gets to warm to stay alive
