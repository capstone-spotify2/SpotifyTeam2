A thousand years from now on
The flame of life's gone out
The earth - a frozen wasteland
No living trace - no sounds

The world did die in anguish
The ashes turned tu dust
Fire and ice - blackness of night
Man's evolution has lost

Don't tell me that we didn't know
And that we haven't been told
The final S.O.S. we all ignored

We've seen the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall

The science of the madman
Was getting out of control
For every creature comfort
There is a heavy toll

We turned on mother nature
Stabbed her deep in the back
We ripped out her lungs - poisoned her veins
Internal acid attack

Don't tell me that we didn't know
And that we've never been told
The final S.O.S. we all ignored

We've seen the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
Seen the writing on the wall

I'm just painting a picture
Of how it could be
But time's running out - the lock's ticking down
You're not blind - can't you see

Don't tell me that we still don't know
And that we're not being told
The final S.O.S. we shouldn't ignore
Just read the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
Read the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
