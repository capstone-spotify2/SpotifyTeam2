Cruising in a limo down the sunset strip
On a Saturday night
Big black Cadillac - jumper cables in the back
Ooh, I'm a rock star

Twenty-seven Marshalls - nothing in the back
Ooh, we make a lot of noise
The chicks kiss your ass for a backstage-pass
No blow - no show

Rich and famous - Twenty-five guitars
A million dollar car
Rich and famous - Golden records on the wall
Platinum we want it all

We want it all and all
A Maserati - A Harley - A place in Beverly
We want it all and all
Yeah tell me now - Ain't Rock'n'Roll wonderful

I got myself accountants to handle my affairs
Managers - lawyers - insurance on my hair
Blew a fortune on a video for MTV
To see it once at half past three a.m.

Rich and famous - Twenty-five guitars
A million dollar car
Rich and famous - Golden records on the wall
Platinum we want it all

We want it all and all
A Maserati - A Harley - A place in Beverly
We want it all and all
Yeah tell me now - Ain't Rock'n'Roll wonderful
Ain't Rock'n'Roll wonderful
