Oooooo <i>[x3]</i>

Staring me down in the mirror
How long will it take til these cracks disappear?
Feeling ashamed, forgetting my name
Where did I go?
Praying to God for a cure
It's so dysfunctional here in the hurt
Lost and confused, feeling the wounds
Where do I go?

Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive

Oooooo <i>[x3]</i>

Climbing the height of my walls
Watching them crumble beneath me in awe
I will be brave, I will be safe
Here in your arms
Now there's no room for afraid
Breaking the boundaries to make myself brave
Hearing the change, turning the page
And now I am free

Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive

Oooooo <i>[x3]</i>

Ahhhhh

Give it all away, give it all away
It's gonna be okay, gonna be okay
I give it all away, give it all away
It's gonna be okay, gonna be okay

Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive, oh alive

Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

Ohhhhh <i>[x3]</i>

I'm alive, I'm alive
