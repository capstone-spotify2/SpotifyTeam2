Stay to the path!
Trust only your faith!
To falter is to hasten your doom!

I dare not say.
My hope is slipping away.

Such gleaming fangs mock the gilded gates!
The way of the truth!

Tell me what to do.
Sweet spirit.
Welcome to what I call hell!
(Yeah)
Your wildest dreams have come true!

Help me!
Infatuation has strangled me again.
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy.
A strange sensation is falling over me.
I may be blind but I can see
Your kiss will ruin me.

I tear myself!
I tear myself from the beaten path!
Never to look back!

And still I glance.
The lure of a forbidden dance.
I'm hypnotized by the sordid nymph who races from me!
Suddenly my eyes see clearly.
Welcome to what I call hell.
(Yeah)
Your wildest dreams have come true!

Help me!
Infatuation has strangled me again.
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy.
A strange sensation is falling over me.
I may be blind but I can see
Your kiss will ruin me.

I fall down on my knees.
In anticipation of the dawning.
Curiosity is laughing.
I decide that if I'm to die here I will not go calmly.
(Down without a fight.)

Help me!
Infatuation has strangled me again.
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy.
A strange sensation is falling over me.
I may be blind but I can see
Your kiss will ruin me!

Your wildest dreams have come true.
