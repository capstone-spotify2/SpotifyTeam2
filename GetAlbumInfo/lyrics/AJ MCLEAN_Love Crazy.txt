I was walkin' down the street with my guitar, (oh)
You pulled up next to me in your fancy car
She said take me to the places where your horses run free
Baby if you know how to ride you can ride me

Said if you wanna rock I got a condom in my pocket
She said baby you're the key so come and unlock it
It's just that easy, to please me

So let's make it baby, you and me baby, we can do it alright
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
We can do it alright
Believe me girl

We barely made it down the street we didn't get far
It doesn't matter where I go there you are

Said she's a sexy thriller dressed in black and red
Girl's so fuckin' cool even wears her shades to bed
It's just that easy, to please me

So let's make it baby, you and me baby, we can do it alright
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
We can do it alright
Believe me girl

Oh my goodness oh my gracious, take me home down to the basement
On the floor on the pavement wake the neighbors let's make a statement
Let 'em watch let 'em stare
Put your legs up in the air smack that ass
And pull your hair take a picture man I don't care
You play checkers I'll play chess then we'll see
Who moves the best you're the teacher
And I'm the pet shut up let's...sex

We can do it alright
Believe me girl

So let's make it baby, you and me baby, we can do it alright
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright

So let's make it baby, you and me baby, we can do it alright
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
We can do it alright
Believe me girl

We can do it alright
We can do it alright
