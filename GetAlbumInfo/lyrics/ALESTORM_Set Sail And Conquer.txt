We set sail at first light
Questing for steel with power and might
For countless days we ride the waves
The battle lies ahead
Our coming they do dread
We raise the black flag
And ready our attack

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die

A reign of blood and slaughter
We show our foes no quarter
Taking their lives and watching them die
We leave our fears behind
Only treasure on our minds
For tonight we raise a hail
In death or victory

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die
