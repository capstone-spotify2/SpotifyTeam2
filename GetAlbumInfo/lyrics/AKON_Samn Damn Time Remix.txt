I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time

I'm far with this shit, it's a lot going on at the same damn time right about now
I put that on my bra, nigga this ain't nothin' new to me
Rollie on my wrist, designer shoes and a Gucci treat
Supermodel bitches and they frizz all in my bathroom'd up
Team money said they like 'er, I said fuck it then I'm passin' up
Got money to blow, I get it like I print it all
A million at the show, ain't no way that I could spend it all
Monday I be all up in my Lambo, cross me pocket chips
Tuesday pull the Rrari up, say I'm on some floss 'n' shit
Wednesday I'm confused, I don't know which car to head on with
I want something new, I'm about to buy some other shit
But I don't know which car to go in yea
I said fuck it, went and bought a lil' jet

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time

I'm back up on my gunner shit, I fuck the bitch you comin' with
No squares in my circle, not the niggas that I haller with
God no, make no noise when I bust cause I muzzle it
1500 mill on the reel I'm tryna double it
Fuck 'em with my diamond shine, fresh up off that diamond mine
Niggas come and get you like they propin' up in columbine
Columbine, propin' up in columbine
You don't want no problem, where I'm from they do this all the time
And you don't wanna gamble with your life
Like the chalk up on that sidewalk, my whips are all white
Crib is all white and that jewelry so bright
Multitask with this pimpin', we could do this all night

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time
