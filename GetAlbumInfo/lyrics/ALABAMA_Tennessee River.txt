I was born across the river
In the mountains where I call home.
Lord, times were good there.
Don't know why I ever roamed.

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

This mountain King done left his throne
On the Tennessee River and His mountain home
But I'm going back, Leaving today
For my homeland so far away
Driving to Dixie, wasting no time
Back to the good life I left behind
Going down to the river with my fishing line
Climb back up the mountain by supper time

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

Me and my woman's done made our plans
On the Tennessee River, walkin' hand in hand
Gonna raise a family, Lord, settle down
Where peace and love can still be found.

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

Oh, Tennessee River...

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

Oh, Tennessee River...
