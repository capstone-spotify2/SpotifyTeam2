I was down to the bone I was lonely only yesterday
Didn't know I was throwin my chances away
Then you came along just long enough to see
Far beyond the fool that I have come to be

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something I've never seen
You made me something I have never been before
Never before

I was always the one who would never give anything away
If all your feeling is cool there's not much to say 
When the silence got too loud for me to bear
You brought me love and taught me how to care

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something I've never seen
You made me something I have never been before
Never before
<i>[REPEAT CHORUS]</i>

<i>[BRIDGE]</i>
Cherish love when you use it
It's never gone they say 
When you have it
It's only love, only love

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something I've never seen
You made me something I have never been before
Never before
