I know the time is right
Blame it on your passionplay
But I know it's just a game

Why don't we fight the fight
Evil it's not here to stay
Broken words are broken ways

I can see it in your eyes
You love the masquerade
And you don't seem to care

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Living out your fantasy, yeah

Never ever sell your soul
Don't surrender your control
No tenderhearted fools, no

Only time will tell the late
'cause with lies we're doomed to fail
Admitted just to ball, yeah

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
In your lap of luxury

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Spread your wings and you'll be free
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Living on the edge won't save ya
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer

Hold on - on your own
All for one - together we make it
You and me - can touch the sky
One for all - in the name of love

Only we can change the world
Make your dreams reality
One for all - it's the human key
All in all

Don't lose control - don't lose your soul
Stop living out you destiny, yeah

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Living out your fantasy

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
It's taking too long the time has come

Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer

Hellhammer
Yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
Stop losing control without no freedom

Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer - Hell - Hellhammer
