If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore

Hey, woke up today
Realized that things just ain't the same
For me and you, I was confused
But now my screws ain't really that loose
After all this time, made up my mind
This relationship wasn't really that tight
You were Mr. Wrong when I needed Mr. Right
Somewhere down the line you lost that body

Cause every day is a battle when it comes to love
You gotta put up a fight
When it comes, when it comes to love
You don't just give up your trying
I've been trying for too long
To get you to hold on
But I guess you, you don't love me anymore

If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore

Shameless, a damn shame the things I do end up this way
Stay awake got nothing to say
Acting like you ain't really that phased
But I swear baby in time
You 'bout to find that missing piece of mine
And when you find that I'm off to the next one
I'll be singing something about my new one

Saddest thing is loving
Loving someone who
Who used to love me
Saddest feeling is knowing how
How good it used to be
I gotta let go of memories
That keep me from leaving
Cause you don't, you don't love me anymore

If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore

I'm done with pretending that we're alright
I can't keep on fronting, I don't wanna lie, anymore
I'm outta door, I'm looking for a better lover
That can make my heart smile
See that's what you used to do
But now you actin like you ain't got nothing to lose
I'm a make it easy for you
I'm a be the first to say it
Darling, I think we're through

If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
