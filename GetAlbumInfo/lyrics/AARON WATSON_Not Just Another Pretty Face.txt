If it was just another night like so many nights before
Just another dance, another time around the floor
Just another heart, you'd break and leave behind
Tell me why you're still awake and that girl is still on your mind

Cause she's not just another pretty face
This time you're in it for more than just the chase
Your hearts against the wall, you thought you seen em all
But she's not just another pretty face 

You thought your heart was ten feet tall and bullet proof
Till a girl only five foot three shot you with the cold hard truth 
All your friends might say, you're way in over your head
But deep down their just jealous it's not them instead 

You've gone hungry, saving for that diamond ring I never thought
You'd see the day
You'd get down on a knee
Cause she's not just another pretty face
This time you're in it for more than just the chase
Your hearts against the wall, you thought you seen em all
But she's not just another pretty face
