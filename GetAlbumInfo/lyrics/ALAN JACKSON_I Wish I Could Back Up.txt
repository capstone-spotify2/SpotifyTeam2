I wish I could back up and start all over
Cause now I'd know better the best way to love her
The words I would tell her the time I would give her
I wish I could back up and start all over

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Time takes you places you never knew you'd be goin' 
It softens the edges of memories you're towin'
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over

I wish I could back up and start all over
I'd make the first time feel like forever
Not to be younger may be just to be smarter 
I wish I could back up and start all over
Time takes you places you never knew you'd be goin' 
It softens the edges of memories you're towin'
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over
I wish I could back up and start all over
Days I would take back nights i'd wanna make longer
Moments i'd never just throw over my shoulder
I wish I could back up and start all over

<i>[BRIDGE]</i>
But it's never too late to wanna do better
Love's never easy, changes just like the weather
Some days it's raining some are sunny and blue
There's never perfect but there's faithful and true
Time takes you places you never knew you'd be goin'
It softens the edges of memories you're towin'
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over
I wish I could back up and start all over
