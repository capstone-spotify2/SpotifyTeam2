Breathing
I am fading
I feel I am losing myself
Wishing I could be someone I'm not
I know somewhere there's a mirror that can show me who I am
Because I will never know
Constantly bending
Engulfed by my history
So scared of letting go
Beyond everything
I wish I could be
I am just a man
The sun will never shine me
I am lost inside the meaningless
We lose control
Like a pendulum
I forgot where I came from
Holding on to the weight of regret
We lose control
Swing me back and forth again
You gave and you bled
Now I'm picking up the pieces of my broken heart
Blocked out
My shattered glass past
Now I'm picking up the pieces I have swept away
We lose control
Swing me back and forth again
