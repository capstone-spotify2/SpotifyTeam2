There's a space in the darkness, where a fire still burns
It's beyond a reason, past point of no return
There's a hunger that's calling, and the fever runs wild
It's where the light throws shadows on the thoughts of every child

Deep within this hallowed chamber where two worlds collide
If you open up the door, don't cross the line

You know it's tearing me apart, this is the dark side of my heart
And I knew it from the start, there in the dark side of my heart

Just a slave to the shadows, just a pawn in the game
Drawn to the slaughter like a moth before a flame
It's the good and the evil, walking side by side
You can feel it coming, but there is no place to hide

Tell me all your darkest secrets and I'll tell you mine
Open up the door but don't cross the line

You know it's tearing me apart, this is the dark side of me heart
And I knew it from the start, here in the dark side of my heart

There's an ager on my shoulder, but the devils whisper in my ear
It's the battle old as time itself
A taunt that never disappears

Tell me all your darkest secrets and I'll tell you mine
Open up the door but don't cross the line

You know it's tearing me apart, this is the dark side of my heart
And I knew it from the start, there in the dark side of my heart
