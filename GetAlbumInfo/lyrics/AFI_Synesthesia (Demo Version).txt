<i>[Spoken Intro]</i>: "Last night...last night, Mom fainted. I sat there watching, 
I sat there waiting, and cringing. And I cried, I cried at the sound, the 
sound of whispering white Angels. Oh, where only I seem innocent."

Heartbreak, incarnate, i'm nothing if not your memories.
Your heartbreak please let me be, enjoying your pain.
Some day, I will be, i'll be the common voice for community.
Because I may well forever be, the lonelyness you feel.

Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow,
letters of past, so distant and wrinkled.

Just say,

(follow me)
Invite me to your memory.
Just sing,
sing again, for me.
(for me)
That long forgotten song.
