Well I never meant to be the greatest
I only ever wanted to be your baby
Not a stuck piece in your heart
Don't ever let me go
Go anywhere

Should I stay, stay away
I know you been out there tryin' to be my baby
But God help us, help us all
Don't ever let me down
Go ahead and do with it

I stayed, stayed away
I know you ain't out there tryin' to be my baby
Dried up, ugly in your soul
Don't ever let me go
I can be your one and only

But I never meant to be the greatest
I know you ain't out there tryin to be my baby
C'mon love me c'mon
God please give 'im some soul
If you can do anything
