Transcendent fear in the 21st century. 
Lost in psychic dire straights.
With our enemies decided and our battlefields celebrated, 
"We walk with faith not sight".

How can we heal these bitter divisions?
How can we overcome our mutual distrust?
How can we heal these bitter divisions?
How can we reconcile our differences?

Mass hysteria in an age of delusion. 
Intellectualism surrenders to ineptitude. 
No love lost, no love gained, no common understanding. 
Head strong and determined, self obsessed with calloused indifference.

How can we heal these bitter divisions?
How can we overcome our mutual distrust?
How can we heal these bitter divisions?
How can we reconcile our differences?
