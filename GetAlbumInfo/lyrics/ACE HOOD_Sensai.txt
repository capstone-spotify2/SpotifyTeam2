Them blades chopping like a Sensei
I'm on the block like I'm Dikembe
Don't ever shit where your head lay
And I ain't never give a fuck 'bout what a bitch say
I'm tryna see that money six ways
I'm tryna pull up in that new thing
Get it forever like I'm Wu-Tang
Walk in the building like I own things

Whip cost 200 plus, really I don't give a fuck
I just got a check bruh, and I'm 'bout to fuck it up
Designer on my asshole, that's 200 on the dashboard
I'm on my fuck nigga free shit, I'm on that let my niggas breathe shit
I'm with the shits I'm on the nonsense
I brought my Haitians from the projects, settle down tell 'em settle down
Can't hear you niggas 'cause the weed loud
I made lil' mama hold the team down, I got lil' mama on her knees now
I'm just caught up in the wave, salute the ones who getting paid

Them blades chopping like a Sensei
I'm on the block like I'm Dikembe
Don't ever shit where your head lay
And I ain't never give a fuck 'bout what a bitch say
I'm tryna see that money six ways
I'm tryna pull up in that new thing
Get it forever like I'm Wu-Tang
Walk in the building like I own things

Crib worth a couple mil, J's cost 200 dollars
I'm jigging off a half a pill, I look like I hit the lotto
You know I'm tripping bitch I'm too sauced
I'm out on Collins with the roof off
Look at them haters they so pissed off
Them ugly bitches make my dick soft
Credit card swiping I'm just spending fuck a limit
Fucking with them thots boy you gon' end up in a clinic
Wait a minute, pay attention, these are Saint Laurent's and not them True Religions
I'm a show boat, you a slow poke
Couple rings like I just had won the rose bowl
These niggas clowns I just look at them like bozos
It's Hood Nation all my niggas they on go mode

Them blades chopping like a Sensei
I'm on the block like I'm Dikembe
Don't ever shit where your head lay
And I ain't never give a fuck 'bout what a bitch say
I'm tryna see that money six ways
I'm tryna pull up in that new thing
Get it forever like I'm Wu-Tang
Walk in the building like I own things
