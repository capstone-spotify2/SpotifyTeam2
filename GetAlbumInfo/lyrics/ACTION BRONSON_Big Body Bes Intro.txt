<i>[Big Body Bes:]</i>
Yeah, here I am again, Big Fuckin' Body, it's me
We done came a long fucking way from stealing out the supermarket man
I'm out here, oh my god
We out here so fuckin' heavy man
Mr. Motherfuckin' Marvelous Himself
But enough about me man, and more about myself
We out here, all types of big situations on the table, man
And I'm just pulling my chair up man
Let me put my motherfucking paper plates up, man
Big Body
The 06 Commissary King
I had the most fuckin' tunas in the house
Rice game, soup game ridiculous man
I had all a dat man
Soap, deodorant on stack
Ask about me man
Two buckets under the bed man
Fuck outta here
You must be outchea motherfuckin' mind man
I does this man
This is me man
No rap checks man
I does this man
Platinum in the street
You must be out your fuckin' head
It's me, though
Body
