There's no one in life quite like you, you baby
There's no one in life quite like you, you baby

As I sit and wonder baby how you do the things you do, yeah
I know deep down in my heart I never see all the way through
I smile and I'm glad, you're the best thing that I ever had

There's no one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
No one in life quite like you, you baby

One more thing, smoke stacks signal your love
Coming from my window pane, yeah
All I need from you baby is to take you in my arms again, yeah
One smile from you is all I need to see me through my day

No one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
There's no one in life quite like you, hold it back there now, you baby

Here we go
One word from you is all I need
One, one, one kiss from you
Oh, will set me free

There's no one in life quite like you, you
You're so unique baby, I can't I can't explain it
No one in life quite like you, oh baby, you baby

There's no one in life quite like you, you
No one in life quite like you baby, you

Like you, like you
Early in the morning, have a smile on your face
Late in the midnight hour, no one can take your place
Even sashay, glass on wine, you're so fine
