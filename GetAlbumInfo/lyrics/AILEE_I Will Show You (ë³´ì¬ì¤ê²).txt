<i>[English Translation:]</i>

Youâre probably wearing the clothes I bought you
You probably put on the cologne I bought you
And right now, youâre probably meeting her and laughing

Did you like her that much that you had to leave me?
How much more do I have to be better?

No matter how much I try to erase you
We spent so many days together
The past times are so regrettable that tears keep flowing butâ¦

I will show you a completed changed me
I will show you a way prettier me
I donât wanna cry like a fool over love, over you who left

I will meet a hotter guy and I will show you for sure
A me who is happier than you
I wonât be sad without you, I wonât break down
Boy you gotta be aware

I neatly change my hairstyle and carefully apply my makeup
With my high heels and short skirt, everyone turns to look at me

If I ever run into you, I will give a dazzling smile
Pass by your surprised face and click clack go on my way

I will show you a completed changed me
I will show you a way prettier me
I donât wanna cry like a fool over love, over you who left

I will meet a hotter guy and I will show you for sure
A me who is happier than you
I wonât be sad without you, I wonât break down
Boy you gotta be aware

I will throw away the ring you gave me
I will erase the letters you wrote me
Without lingering attachment, without regret, Iâll forget you
I wanna forget you, I wanna erase you

I will show you a completed changed me
I will show you a way prettier me
I donât wanna cry like a fool over love, over you who left

I will meet a hotter guy and I will show you for sure
A me who is happier than you
I wonât be sad without you, I wonât break down
Boy you gotta be aware
