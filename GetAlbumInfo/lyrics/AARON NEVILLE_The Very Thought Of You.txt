The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream and I'm happy as a king
And foolish as it may seem to me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you the very thought of you, my love

I'm living in a kind of daydream and I'm happy as a king
And foolish as it may seem to me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the mere idea of you
The longing here for you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
It's just the thought of you the very thought of you, my love
