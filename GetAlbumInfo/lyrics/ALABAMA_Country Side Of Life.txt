You can have your buildings
And your arithmatic
I don't need no crowded streets
Or city slicker tricks
I just need to be some place
Where I can move around
Look down at my toes
And I can still see the ground.

Give me that country side of life
Where I can stretch out right
Give me the country side
(Give me the country side)
Give me that country side of life
Where I don't get uptight
Give me the country side.

Goin' down to the fishing pond
Where I can throw in the line
It dont' matter what fish I catch
I only came to rest my mind
The only fish you'll get down town
Ain't caught with a hook and sinker
Put on your brakes, beep beep,
Honk your horn look out now
Turn on your blinker.

Give me that country side of life
Where I can stretch out right
Give me the country side
(Give me the country side)
Give me that country side of life
Where I don't get uptight
Give me the country side.

Give me that country side of life
Where I don't get uptight
Give me the country side...

I was born in Georgia town
With a lack-a-daisy street
A laid back lover just a-playin' games
And a-stayin' off of them feet
Nobody trying to get on your nerves,
Nobody tryin' to get what you've got
And just live and let live by the golden rule
Now don't it just hit the spot

Give me that country side of life
Where I can stretch out right
Give me the country side
(Give me the country side)
Give me that country side of life
Where I don't get uptight
Give me the country side

Give me that country side of life
Where I can stretch out right
Give me the country side
Give me that country side of life
Where I don't get uptight
Give me the country side...
