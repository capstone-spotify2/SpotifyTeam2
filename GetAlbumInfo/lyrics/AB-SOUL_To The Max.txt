I wake up every morning to text messages
From foreigners saying they love me, they miss me
They want me, are you in town?
When are you coming over, are you around?
Howâs life treating you? Are you holding it down?
Can you wear my T-shirt? Can you come to my store?
How much for a verse from Kendrick Lamar?
Is Q really from Hoover? Is Rock still signed to Tech N9ne?
And this is just when I rise, imagine my whole day
My momma smiling more than ever, man and itâs so strange
Itâs what I asked for though, I canât complain
I wanna say âI told you soâ but that wonât change a thing Iâm afraid
I paid my little sisterâs rent last month, man, that was great
My grandpa thought I wouldnât graduate
Now Iâm selling out shows and heâs stoked and shows all in his face
I even put my step pops in his place, for questioning my objective in this place
I donât blame him, Iâm just saying, always knew I was the man
I owe nothing to no one, except those who told me I was the one
When lowkey I wasnât, that was what I was becoming
Now Iâm buzzing and everybody my cousin, thatâs phony
Yâall donât know me, where was yâall when I was lonely?
A pack of Black and Milds every twenty four hours
Skipping showers âcause I felt dirty, unworthy of power
Though I never cursed the Lord, but I questioned his motives
I still do, except now, Iâm exceptionally focused
However the road ends, Iâm rolling, say amen
You foes wonât stop me or succeed like I can
I see snakes, the grass must be cut, is it Wednesday?
And Iâm happy especially nip it at the bud now
And what is happening exactly? Iâm sick of the smoke signals
Like a green cross in a dispensary window
Unit 6 woulda been dope but the industry wouldnât let it
Creativity donât tend to mix with business endeavors
Whatever though, you know the anthem is get money and some
Become a legend and leave a legacy for your grandson
I told Lani Iâmma do it, and I did it, hope she forgive me when she hear me saying shit like
âGâs up nigga, hoes down, if the bitch can't swim, then she gonâ drown in itâ

You know I stay on my humble but these days ainât fuckinâ with me (ainât fuckinâ with me)
I go from Carson to Harlem, I hold it down, how couldnât you see? (how couldnât you see?)
You know Iâm here for the long term, itâs my turn, pull up a seat (pull up a seat)
Go ahead and light up the smoke and throw up your hands and wave with me
Whereâs Max B when you need him?
Whereâs Max B when you need him?
Pour up your drink and wave with me
Whereâs Max B when you need him?
Whereâs Max B when you need him?
Whereâs Max B when you need him?
This is the new wave now jump in the sea

<i>[Max B:]</i>
Ay yo, yâall niggas stay wavy man, I love yâall man
Keep the wave goinâ I told yâall I was gonna leave yâall with that wave
About 500 out there in the <i>[?]</i> county
Man yâall stay strong, Iâm still staying strong, Iâm focused
Iâm on my way back, prophecy will be fulfilled
Itâs wavy for life, donât forget it Iâm still wavy
Oww, Oww
