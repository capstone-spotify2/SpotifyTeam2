Up in smoke
This is a joke
Isn't it
All your fault
You went too far
Call it quits
No one knew
The dare to prove
Came and went
Moving on
Chance is gone
Throw a fit

So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose

You're so weak
Beat up a geek
Makes you complete
Not so tough
I've had enough
Now I leave
Getting away
One more day
Till then I'll sleep
All I need's
A chance to bleed
On me they feed

So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose

I know who you are
I know where you're going

So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
a tighter noose
