The light was on, and everything I felt was strong
I watched as your mascara ran
Didn't get far on that golden tan

I heard you sigh, but I don't wanna see you cry
You looked just like a walking dream
Sweeter than peaches and cream

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you want me let me know
I can show you how
If you've got nowhere to go
I can show you now

I'm yours to tame, and I don't even know your name
I like to touch your perfect skin
I can't stop once I begin

To show you more than I have ever shown before
If you could read what's on my mind
Give me yours and I'll give you mine

<i>[Chorus]</i>

We could be, we could see
More than we know
We should be, we should see
More than we know
And I'd like to know

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Sweeter than peaches and cream (If you want me let me know)
Sweeter than peaches and cream (I can show you how)
<i>[Repeat And Fade]</i>
