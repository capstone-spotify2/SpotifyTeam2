Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
And knew that he couldn't last
And Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Got to get back, get back
Get on, get on back to where you once belonged
Alright, get back, got to get on back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jojo
I'm goin'

Now get back, get back
Got to get on back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get to where you once belonged

Come here

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
And all the girls around her say she's got it comin'
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Got to get back, got to get back
Get back, get back to where you once belonged

Get on back, Loretta
Alright now

Get back, got to, got to get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, got to get back, get back, get back
