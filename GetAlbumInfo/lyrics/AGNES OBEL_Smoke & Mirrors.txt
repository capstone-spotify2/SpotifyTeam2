Oh my one, I'm so happy
That you've got so far
I know the good, the great
Is working you like a charm.

Oh my one, rushing away
With a bag full of bones
I know the place you left
Still won't leave you alone.

The crow, the cat, the bird and the bee
I'm sure they would agree
That my one is falling for tricks,
Smoke and mirrors playing your wit.

A hue and cry waiting to blow
Under your skin, wherever you go
Still I wish that I knew
The taste of something that good.
