Stories are painted
In lines on your face
Misunderstandings 
And little mistakes 
A chance to start over
Is all that it takes 
You know if you do
Your life is a canvas 
The colors are you 

Follow me out 
Follow me 'round 
Let's make the road up as we go along
Just as we planned 
You want to believe it 
You know that it's true 
Your life is a canvas
The colors are you

You cannot erase them 
The words that were said
Just paint them over 
Inside of your head
All that is needed 
You know you must make 
One leap of faith 
Everything else will fall into place 

Follow me out 
Follow me 'round 
Let's make it up and go back 
To where it began 
All that is needed
Is one leap of faith
Everything else will fall into place

Anywhere you'll ever go 
Everyone you'll ever know
You may never find it
Everyone you'll ever see 
Anyone you choose to be 
How you look will decide 
How you look will decide what you see 

Follow the moon
Follow the sun
Let's make a deal this time 
To stay with the plan 
All that is needed is one leap of faith 
Everything else will fall into place
Everything else will fall into place 

Stories are painted 
In the lines of your face...
