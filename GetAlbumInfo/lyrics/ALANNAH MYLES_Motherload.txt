At any given moment
You could be gone
I swear, I need a weather vane
A sweeter warning

Of all the roles I've taken
There isn't anyone
That I wouldn't play
For another morning

Well, it ain't wrong, baby
'Cause it dares me to say
I belong here
It just is, that's all

While you were sleeping
There was a mutiny
Love became your enemy

I know, it ain't wrong, baby
But it dares me to say
You belong here
It just is, that's all

So, I'll break my code
Can you share the motherload?
Still so far to go
Can we share the motherload?

Oh motherload, oh mother, mother, motherload
Oh motherload, oh can we all, hear me all, motherload
Motherload, motherload, baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, can you share the motherload?
Aha, oh, oh, oh, oh, can you s-s-share the motherload?

So, I break my code
Can you share the motherload?
Still so far to go
Can you share the motherload?

So, I break my code
Can you share the motherload?
Am I on my own?
Or will you share the motherload?

Still so far to go
Can you share the motherload?
Can you share the motherload?
