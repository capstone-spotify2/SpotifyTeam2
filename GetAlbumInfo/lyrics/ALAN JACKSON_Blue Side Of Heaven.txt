Don't be sad darlin' I love you 
And I'll take you with my soul's memory 
I'm just going ahead to tell them about you 
So they will all know you the way that I do 

And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven 
Where angels sing and days never end 
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven 
Where God will bless our love once again 

I'll teach them all the songs that we love dear 
And I'll tell them of our babies at home 
I'll hug and kiss all of our loved ones 
Who came before so I'm not alone 

And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven 
Where angels sing and days never end 
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven 
Where God will bless our love once again 

So let me go and tell me you love me 
I'm not afraid as darlin' I know 
That someday soon you'll be there with me 
We'll be together as long as time goes 

And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven 
Where angels sing and days never end 
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven 
Where God will bless our love once again 

So don't be sad you know that I love you 
And I'll see you when it comes to your time 
We'll walk along some beautiful river 
Hand in hand on life's other side
