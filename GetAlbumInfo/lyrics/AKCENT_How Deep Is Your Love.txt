I'm trying
Not to be falling
When I need you
Thinking of you
Wanna touch you
I'm drowning inside you
Forever and ever and ever...

How deep is your love

Your love <i>[x5]</i>

I'm trying to see you flying
Wanna take you into the blue
Wanna hold you
I'm feeling some magic
When you are here

There is no fear <i>[x2]</i>

How deep is your love

Your love <i>[x5]</i>

I'm falling
Inside is feeling
So keep me falling
Right inside you
Having no clue
Keep me falling
We are falling
Into the blue
Helping no clue
What should we do?
We'll be falling in
