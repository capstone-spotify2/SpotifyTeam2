Swing through sadness, tears of joy. 
Curse the sunlight. 
Arsenic for the girls and boys. 
Drink the madness, smoke so coy. 
Smile injection. 
Serum of a will destroyed. 
The seasons change without me. 
I remain in shadows growing wings. 
The spirit song still surrounds me, in refrain, in shadows growing wings. 
Like an angel with two broken wings, reach the sky again. 
Like a devil, meant for better things, I will find my place on high.
