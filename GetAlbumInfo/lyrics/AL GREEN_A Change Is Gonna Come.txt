You look good out there, baby

I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, just like the river, I been running ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will, look it here

It's been too hard living and I'm afraid to die
Look it here
Cuz I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long
I wish I could come out there where you are baby
A long time coming but I know
Look it here
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Look it here

Let me say one more thing

A long time coming but I know, yeah
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Look it here, one more time
