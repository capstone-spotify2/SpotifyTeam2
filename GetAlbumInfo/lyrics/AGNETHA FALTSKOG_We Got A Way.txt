How many times, looking at your picture
I've liked the way that you talk to me
But even in my dreams I've had to let you go
I know, I know

You're gonna say it's slippin' through our fingers
And all I want is, darlin', to be wanting you
Get away, don't give me the fever or the touch
'Cause it hurts too much

We've got a way with pulling in closer
And treating love so recklessly
We've got a way with pushing our luck
Oh, I've got a way with you and you've got a way with me

We've got a way with taking it higher
And hanging on so helplessly
We've got a way with pushing our luck
Oh, I've got a way with you and you've got a way with me

How many times, thinking of the feelings
I like it better when you're close to me
And in my heart, oh I'll never let you go
I know, I know

And when I look, look into your eyes I see
The way you're holding and you're tempting me now
I feel your kiss, oh I've got to get away
But tell me this, tell me will you miss me?

We've got a way with pulling in closer
And treating love so recklessly
We've got a way with pushing our luck
Oh, I've got a way with you and you've got a way with me

We've got a way with taking our chances
And hiding things that lovers do
But when you leave me, darling
I just can't hold on to you

Only for second chances
Only for words we had to say
Only to my real love
Why did you get away?

We've got a way with pulling in closer
And treating love so recklessly
We've got a way with pushing our luck
Oh, I've got a way with you and you've got a way with me

We've got a way with taking our chances
And hiding things that lovers do
But when you leave me, darling
I just can't hold on to you

We've got a way with pulling in closer
And treating love so recklessly
We've got a way with pushing our luck
Oh, I've got a way with you and you've got a way with me
