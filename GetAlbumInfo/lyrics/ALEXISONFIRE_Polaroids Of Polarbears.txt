Raped by my childhood?
What the hell do I know about rape anyway?
Well, I guess it's fun to pretend.
Sorry.
Just a thought that occurred when I wasn't quite awake enough
To dismiss it.

It's easy.
(You always used to stay within arms reach.)
To cheapen an event.
(Now it seems I'm all by myself)
By pretending it happened.
Only by pretending it happened.
(Save my life.)
Life.

(My life was taken tonight.)
My life.
(My life was ended tonight.)
My life.

Boring cliched self-destruction.
I think I should start doing aerobics.
And the rest...

Boxes of cats,
People with Taz tattoos,
Explosive personalities,
Self-centeredness,
Protractor from your new geometry set,
Inability to do math,
Geography.

Polaroids
(Tonight)
Of polar bears.
(Tonight)
Polaroids
(My life)
Of polar bears.

Polaroids...
