You donât make it easy to love you
Some might say Iâm a fool
But I believe one day youâll find that 
I am the one for you

Love is thin, love is wide
Love is more than one size
Love is patient, love is kind
And I will wait all my life
Just to hear you say
That you love
That you love me
And I wonât say Iâm a fool
âCause you believe that 
I am the one for you

Love is thin, love is wide
Love is more than one size
Love is patient, love is kind
And I will wait all my life
Just to hear you say
That you love me
I wonât feel like a fool
âCause you believe that
I am the one for you

You donât make it easy to love you
Some might say Iâm a fool
Well I believe one day youâll find that
I am the one for you

I believe one day youâll find that
I am the one for you
