Secrets they were killing me
Pulled me under in too deep
All those shadows they donât let go easily
But everything I covered up
Is opening inside your love
Let Your grace illuminate the heart in me

Oh Youâre bringing me to life
Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You
Oh, youâre changing me inside
And Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You

Breathe Your breath into my soul
Let my heart beat with Your own
I need Your mercy even when it hurts
Please shine on me
Shine on me

Oh Youâre bringing me to life
Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You
Oh, Youâre changing me inside
And Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You

And if thereâs anything I try to hide
I pray that you would bring it to the light
Strip away the lies if I pretend
Teach me how to be a child again
Resting in your arms, resting in your arms
And I can feel your love changing me

Oh Youâre bringing me to life
Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You
Oh, I finally realize
That Iâm finding who I am in You, who I am in You
