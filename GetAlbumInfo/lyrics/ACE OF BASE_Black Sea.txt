Is it you? <i>[x3]</i>

I guess you always 
Wanted freedom 
No guarantees 
In the western world 
Love forsaken 
My heart is aching 
You turned to east 
To find your peace

(My everlasting dream)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Black Sea, what do I see? 
(This) glimmer on the ocean, (is it you?) 
Black sea for you and me 
(So) close but far away 
Na, na, na, na â Can there be a chance? 
Na, na, na, na â For you and me 
Na, na, na, na â Feel my humble stance 
Youâre my swedish complete taboo 

(My everlasting dream)

My enigma is 
Keeping our secret 
Cross my heart 
And hope to die 
Dream dynamic 
So panoramic 
When yearning wail 
My endless tale 

(My everlasting dream)

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I guess you always 
Wanted freedom 
No guarantees 
In the Western World 
Love forsaken 
My heart is aching 
You turned to east 
To find your peace

I hear waves are roaring in 
Birds are crying loud 
My adoring sin 
Iâm standing here so proud 
Why? 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
