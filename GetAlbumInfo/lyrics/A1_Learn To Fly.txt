When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see thatâs not the way
The story has to end 

And if you need to find a way back
Feel youâre on the wrong track
Give it time, youâll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
Youâll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then youâll learn to fly

In your head, so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart)
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope
And you will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see thatâs not the way
The story has to end

And if you need to find a way back
Feel youâre on the wrong track
Give it time, youâll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
Youâll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then youâll learn to fly

Looking at your situation
Thereâs so much that you can do
Nowâs the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end itâs up to you
The futureâs in your hands

And if you need to find a way back
Feel youâre on the wrong track
Give it time, youâll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
Youâll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then youâll learn to fly

Give it time
Then youâll learn to fly
