It's hard to describe
You're like nothing I've ever known in my life
Kindness flowing from down deep inside your eyes
So selfless and complete

A beauty in and out
All around you not a single cloud
Like the rain just stops before it hits the ground
And puddles at your feet

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You're an angel
I know heaven wonders where you are
Like you fell off some ol' shining star
Right into my heart
An angel,
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
An angel, everything but the wings

Looking at you
It's hard to believe that you could feel the way I do
Never thought I'd find so much love we fall into
Or perfect or true
So never go away
If heaven calls you back just ask if you can stay
I'd never find someone to ever take your place
You know they only made a few

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause you're an angel
I know heaven wonders where you are
Like you fell off some old shining star
Right into my heart
An angel,
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
An angel, everything but the wings

Everything but the wings
An angel
Everything but the wings
