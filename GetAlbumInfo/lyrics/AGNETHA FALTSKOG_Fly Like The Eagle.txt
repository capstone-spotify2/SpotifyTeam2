Could it be we cherish a dream?
Could it be the way that it seems?
You and I,
Together we discover the scene.

Leaving all your troubles behind,
Leave them all and open your mind,
You and I, forever we hold on to it
Together we can find

We can fly, fly like the eagle,
On the wings of the sunlight under the sky
Where we fly, fly like the eagle,
From dawn to the moonlight under a clear blue sky.

Take me where the mountains are high
Take me where we're close to the sky
You and I,
Together we're the clouds passing by.

Summer is the time for romance,
Winter gives the lovers a chance,
You and I, forever all the seasons
We're together is the reason

We fly, fly like the eagle,
On the wings of the sunlight under the sky
Where we fly, fly like the eagle,
From dawn to the moonlight under a clear blue sky.

We could fly, fly like the eagle,
On the wings of the sunlight under the sky
Where we fly, fly like the eagle,
From dawn to the moonlight under the sky...
