I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me

And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Heading my own road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that roof but your roots to the ground-boys
Pink house, the white fence
Pretty little woman, two point five
Kids, dang right, it's a good life
With boys like me your bound to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me

And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me

Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss, you said the sink still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that sink but your roots to the ground-boys
Blue house, the white fence
Sweet little woman, rocking that good
Miss dang right, it's a fine life
His restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me

So Tom and Jack just ramled on without me
'Cause I was gone before you met me
Gone gone, gone before you met me
Gone before you met me
