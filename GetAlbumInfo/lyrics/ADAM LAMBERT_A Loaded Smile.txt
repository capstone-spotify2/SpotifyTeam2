If I say I'm sorry
It's just me telling a lie
When you're in my arms
I feel emptier inside
I never felt so satisfied

Everything falls into place but
I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive

A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance

Walking hand in hand
You are all I ever want
And when you're not around yeah
Don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on

Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive

Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it?
I do still want to baby
It's a certain kind of complicated
Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it?
I do still want to baby
It's a certain kind of complicated

Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?
Keeps me wantin ya
It's a certain kind of kinda crazy
Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?
Keeps me wantin ya
It's a certain kind of kinda crazy, yea

Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive

A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance
