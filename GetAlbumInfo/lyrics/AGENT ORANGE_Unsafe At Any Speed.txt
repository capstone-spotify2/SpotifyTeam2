<i>[voice of evel knievel:]</i>
"i've got to tell you,
that you are the last people in the world
who will see me jump, because i will never,
ever, ever jump again.  i am through."

i believe that every inch of smooth cement
upon this earth is sacred
that he who sees it blur beneath his feet
will always be one step ahead
i can see the only way that we can change
our future is to brainwash and manipulate
the minds of those who draw the lines
that form the city scapes

what moves beyond these walls
won't get far without abusing all the laws
i'll tell you why
we are unsafe at any speed

you're lost, now shut your eyes
get ready for another big surprise
all at once you're blinded by the flashing lights
a blessing in disguise
every time you stop to think
you waste another precious moment
and every time you draw another breath
you're one breath closer to the end

somehow i'll survive - i've got to live
`cuz that's the only thing that makes me feel alive
we are unsafe at any speed
