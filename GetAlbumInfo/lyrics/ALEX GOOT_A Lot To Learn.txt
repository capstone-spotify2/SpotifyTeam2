Thereâs a lot of things that I will do
When I am all grown up
Itâs time for me to start some of them now
Wake up everyday to this
Alarm clock on my shelf
Responsibility means get up now

I got a lot to learn
I got a lot to learn

Iâve been thinking about my
Aspirations in the sky
Thereâs a lot of life a head of me
And I got a lot to learn

I know that everyday will count for something
Cause I know Iâd never work for nothing
I know that someday I will have to move on
And move out

Iâve been thinking about my
Aspirations in the sky
Thereâs a lot of life a head of me
And I got a lot to learn
I got a lot to learn

Iâm borderline
Iâm in the middle of this
And I donât know which way,
Which way to go

Iâm borderline
Iâm in the middle of all of this
And I know donât know which way to go

Iâve been thinking about my
Aspirations in the sky
Thereâs a lot of life a head of me
And I got a lot to learn
