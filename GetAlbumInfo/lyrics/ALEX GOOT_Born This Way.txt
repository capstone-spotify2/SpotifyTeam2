My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled your hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up boy and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag â just be a queen <i>[x3]</i>
Don't be!

Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth

A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M (Hey hey hey)
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag â just be a queen <i>[x3]</i>
Don't be!

No matter gay, straight, or bi,
Lesbian, transgendered life,
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born to survive.
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made,
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born to be brave.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

I was born this way 
I was born this way 
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way 
I was born this way 
I was born this way 
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
