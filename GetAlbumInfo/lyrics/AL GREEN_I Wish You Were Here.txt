Lookin' out my window, sun shinin' bright
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?

I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

<i>[?]</i> 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away

I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

I've got to stop, get myself together
'Coz all I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here
I just wish you were here with me
