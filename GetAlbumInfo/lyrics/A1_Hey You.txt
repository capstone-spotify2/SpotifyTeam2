<i>[VERSE 1]</i>

HEY YOU, LOOKING AROUND AT YOUR FRIENDS
YOU SEE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM HAS CHANGED
AND NOTHINGS CLEAR
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME
DON'T YOU TAKE IT TO HEART ALL THE SAME
YOU'LL SEE IT WORKS OUT BETTER THAT WAY
DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHOUT YOUR NAME

<i>[BRIDGE 1]</i>

DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO
THE WORLS IS WAITING FOR YOU
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO LOSE
EVERYBODY TODAY
EVERYTHING IS OK
COME TOGETHER AND SAY

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP THE WAY YOU'RE FEELING
'COS YOU'VE GOT TIME TO GET IT RIGHT
LET YOUR MIND KNOW WHERE IT'S LEADING
IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT
IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT

<i>[VERSE 2]</i>
HEY YOU, JUST BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE
YOU'LL SEE THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE COME FOR FREE
NOW IT'S ALL CLEAR, NO CLOUDY DAY
IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND BELIEVE
YOU'LL BE EXCITED BY WHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE
DON'T BE AFRAID TO FIND A WAY

<i>[BRIDGE 2]</i>

OH, DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO
THE WORLS IS WAITING FOR YOU
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO LOSE
EVERYBODY TODAY
IF HE THINKS IT'S OK
COME TOGETHER AND SAY

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[BRIDGE 3]</i>

DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO
THE WORLS IS WAITING FOR YOU
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO LOSE
EVERYBODY TODAY
IF HE THINKS IT'S OK
COME TOGETHER AND SAY

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
