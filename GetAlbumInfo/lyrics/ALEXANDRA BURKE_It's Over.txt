Time is held, I can't catch my breath. 
Been fighting so long I just ain't got nothing left, 
Are we done....Cos I can't take it anymore. I just can't take it. 
Been so long since I was close enough to smell your smell. 
Telling me the love was still if it is boy I can't tell. 
Are we done....Cos I can't take it anymore. Said I just can't take it. 

Ooo boy they're ain't no tears to cry 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
We both know this love has died. 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
Cos I just can't take it anymore. 

Say I'm trippin' when I tell you that we've changed, 
That your friends, my friend and everybody saying the same thinng. 
Are we done....Cos I can't take it anymore. Said I just can't take it. 
I've been noticing the way you get dressed up to go to the store. 
It's right around the corner, but you be gone an hour sometimes more. 
I ain't the one and I can't take it anymore. Said I just can't take it. 

Ooo boy they're ain't no tears to cry 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
We both know this love has died. 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
Cos I just can't take it anymore. (Just can't take it anymore) 

We can be honest, we have no reason to lie. 
(Baby we don't have to deny) 
Whatever happens we can't say we didn't try. 
(Nothing for us to do now but say goodbye) 

Ooo boy they're ain't no tears to cry 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
We both know this love has died. 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
Cos I just can't take it anymore. 

Ooo boy they're ain't no tears to cry 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
We both know this love has died. 
I think it's over, 
I think it's over. 
Cos I just can't take it anymore.
