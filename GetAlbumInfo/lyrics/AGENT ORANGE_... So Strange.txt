i've heard that voice before
somehow, i can't imagine
it speaks words without knowing what they mean
i've seen that face before
somewhere, i can't remember
it seems as if it happened in a dream

i laughed and now you know
that some things never change
i laughed again because to me you seem
...so strange

i know i never should expect to finish something
i know will never be complete
i feel as if i'm lost again - i'm not, i'm only dreaming
in a world where sound and silence seem to meet

i block out all the noise
a silent song remains
i know it's only music, but it sounds
...so strange

how does it feel to speak the words
and sing the song?
...so strange
