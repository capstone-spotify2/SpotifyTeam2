I'm falling away from myself away from who I used to be.
Arid skin cracked and torn.
I peel it away.
A change for the better to harness the strength and rise more powerful.
Now more powerful than ever.
A decrepit self once animate now abandoned and left to rot.
Nothing to be salvaged nothing to be saved.
Now follow the thrashing thought of your dream to exist.
Pursue what may never come.
Releasing demons and banishing them to the depths of bloody memories and regrets.
The outer shell is decomposing releasing a new upgraded self.
Bleeding ink reveals the price of expansion.
Push it down hold its hideous face below the water watch 
what was become never again let nothing stop you for 
when it lived it showed no mercy now show it no remorse.
Cut compassion from your mind forget what it means to cherish life.
Now follow the thrashing thought of your dream to exist pursue domination.
