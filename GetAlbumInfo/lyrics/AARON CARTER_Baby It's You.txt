Too hot. Lookin' fantastic
No nips or tucks of plastic
The way she works her magic
She's got me like an addict
I'm not a dreamin' or fantasizing, this could mean
Gotta move on, gotta play the field
Gotta be strong, no time to heal

So check out the girl on the corner of Mason
Looking kinda crazy. I'm amazingly dazed man
Let me hear ya say 'yeah'
Hey, yeah.

Check out the way she ties up her laces
Puttin' a smile on our faces
I say hey (hey) ho (ho)

Baby it's you that I want
So come a little closer
And don't get me wrong
I'm kinda shy, but I know what I want
I'm crazy for you
So baby let's get it on

Come on
Yeah, come on now
Yeah, come on now
Yeah, come on now
Yeah, come on now

Too hot lookin' like crazy
No if's, or but's, or maybes
No time to blind or faze me
Your body activates me
Ohh, she's throwin' her hair back, ahh
And I kinda like that
Gotta move because I like the chase
Gotta move quick no time to waste
