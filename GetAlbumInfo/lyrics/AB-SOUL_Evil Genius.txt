That's just a snare; don't be afraid of the snare

I'm an evil genius, disobedient, villain you hate to love
Mischievous, mysterious, miscellaneous
Used to make love to complex simplicity all the time
Now she my star and I'm her sky and I ain't afraid to die
I don't give a fuck!
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)

Indecisive, enlightening, frightening idol with the light
Sensitive Eye of the Tiger, fire flame
Dylan times 5 by the way
Skydiving tidal waves
Writing rhymes and oxygen
Scribing sonnets silently
That inspire men and brightening environments
That I have not been in
Obviously opting not to sing songs in sobriety
Subsiding the poison imploding our society
Functioning addict with clammy hands
Leaking my paraphernalia everywhere
Told Lori I'll never do coke again, but she did what she did
And I'm here again, I ain't pointing no fingers
I'm still a man
No, I'm more than that
You would know if you scrolled through my older tracks
I'm just the Romeo mourning his Juliet
Hadid incomplete without Lou Reed
And do me a favor and save all that satanist shit
You pagans gone pay for this shit
I studies theology, ancient philosophy, astronomy, astrology
The current state of the economy
Washington D.C, fossils and dinosaurs
The origin of our species
Monatomic gold
Flowers grown in feces
Christ Conscious, Pishon, mocking Jesus
The chicken came before the eggs, the thesis
I bet she's an evil genius

Disobedient, villain you hate to love
Mischievous, mysterious, miscellaneous
Used to make love to complex simplicity all the time
Now she my star and I'm her sky and I ain't afraid to die
I don't give a fuck!
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck

Heaven is missing its angel of fire
Your passion is needed right here on this earth
When the Lord calls for you after you die
I'll wait past my lifetime for you to return
You be my star
I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me and come out at night
And when I turn jet black and you show off your light
I live to let you shine
I live to let you shine
