When I was a kid I had it made in the shade
Couple girlfriends and a Chevrolet
Oh how I long for those days
When all I needed was a couple of bucks
Just enough to put some gas in my truck
Buy a six pack of beer and get a weird haircut

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off

Well I grew up so they say
Got a real job and and IRA
A mortgage on this house
I can barely pay
A blackberry and a cellphone
I spend more time at work
Then I do at home
Somebody please tell me where I went wrong

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off

I know nothing stays the same
But I feel like I'm dancing
Way too close to the flame

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off

Yeah I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
