(Are you ready)
(Statik Selectah drop)

Changing my life man
As I sit here and smoke this fucking drugs to the neck
Just be pondering on that shit man
Expands the mind
Yeah
Yo

I free my mind, want to travel in time
To a place where the world moves slowly, I'm feeling lonely
No one to hold me, no one to console me
My drug use out of control, I hit the road
Leaving behind all the memories of yore
Not of drinking, but it had me sipping Hennessey for sure
My daily thoughts are 'what's the penalty for raw?'
When I should be making money singing records on a tour
But I'm stuck in a room, living with mommy
Telling bitches not to scream so loud, serving salami
I won't stop until I'm laying in Ferrari
Long removed from the days of playing Sega and Atari
Failure's not an option, success is imminent
Not trying to have my baby raised up in the tenement
Take a hit of haze, the vision right in front of you
Hard work 'til I'm set like the sun'll do

<i>[Hook x2:]</i>
This green plant has infested my mind
Over years I've invested my time, not to mention paper
Now I'm looking for a comeback, a gamebreaker
Stomp the ground, do a dance--the rainmaker

So now I'm smoking, and I'm stuck in a daze
Hear the music of the waves, silent stuck in a cave
Searching for daylight, I promise that I'll change
Before I see the grave, never that--fingers crossed
Every day it seems I'm talking to the wall more
Hallucinations, bugging, digging up the floorboards
Set me free to a life without anxiety
Every day I'm moving further from sobriety
No one helped me when my life was in a spiral
Now I'm something like a pyro, I'm on fire
'Lo attire, choking victims with a short wire
Situations for the money cause the dough dire
Kids are hungry and they need an education
But mommy needs a leather jacket, 47 bracelets
Facelift, don't forget about the basics
Don't ever trust a fucking fake bitch
Understand me?
