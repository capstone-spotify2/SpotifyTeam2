Oh, baby, I found heaven when I found you 
And this heaven is somethin' I don't wanna lose 
I only know that if you ever said goodbye, I couldn't stand the pain 
These eyes would cry, cry, cry like the rain 

And the sun would have nowhere to shine 
And the stars would all fall from the sky 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know 
And I'd lose my whole world if you go 
Baby, don't 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

Oh, baby, I saw forever when I saw you 
And if you left me, I can't imagine what I'd do 
Now that I've gone and built my world around your love, I couldn't let you go 
Don't ever say goodbye, no, don't, don't, don't ever go 

'Cause the sun would have nowhere to shine 
And the stars would all fall from the sky 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know) 
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go) 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

'Cause you might as well take my life from me 
What good would a life without you be anyway (Anyway) 
If you go away 

Well, the sun would have nowhere to shine 
And the stars would all fall from the sky (From the sky) 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know) 
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go) 
Baby, don't, no 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love 
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch 
Baby, don't 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 

Please don't take away my heaven 
Please 
Baby, don't, oh, no 
Don't take away my heaven, oh... 

Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love 
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch 
Baby, don't, oh 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
