Momma never raise no fool
That's why I keep my bible by my tool
That's why I say my prayers before I move
Just don't ever get the shit confused
Cause I got way too much of shit to lose
I don't give a fuck what you assume
Cause I got way too much of shit to prove
Who are you to ever judge me nigga?

I got people praying on my downfall
I got goonies with me they are hound dogs
Pull up then hop out and spray them rounds off
Shots for everybody nigga Mazel Tov
I'm not with the games this ain't Nintendo
I'm tryna' stack that dough long as a limo
Pull up in that Bentley Continental
Smelling like a whole pound of that indo
That money I'm addicted I'm a nympho
Number Uno just don't ever give out info
Threaten mine I'll have you hanging out your window
All in sequence like they tryna' keep the tempo
Snatch a bag and spilt the cake up if you worthy
I'm a sinner lord I'm nowhere near the perfect
Told my niggas we gon' get it and we got it
Shhâ¦ there they go to plot tin'
Momma never raise no

Momma never raise no fool
That's why I keep my bible by my tool
That's why I say my prayers before I move
Just don't ever get the shit confused
Cause I got way too much of shit to lose
I don't give a fuck what you assume
Cause I got way too much of shit to prove
Who are you to ever judge me nigga?

I got money buried that you don't know about
That's a half of ticket in the parking lot
I walk in the building like I fucking own it
You look at my section it's a bunch of hoes
You looking at my diamonds you need shades on
You would probably think I turned the lights on
Ok I step off in this bitch I'm holla'n, "Sak Pase!"
In the section all my Zoes are screaming, "N'ap boulÃ©"
We ain't drinking no champagne we on that Hennessy
Tell the DJ run this back and keep it on replay
We got it jumping got it jumping bitch we trampolining
We made a movie the promoter said he never seen it
Told him, "You welcome" flossed the bezel I am too conceited
They say the same nigga that doubted now they beg for features
Jesus

Momma never raise no fool
That's why I keep my bible by my tool
That's why I say my prayers before I move
Just don't ever get the shit confused
Cause I got way too much of shit to lose
I don't give a fuck what you assume
Cause I got way too much of shit to prove
Who are you to ever judge me nigga?
