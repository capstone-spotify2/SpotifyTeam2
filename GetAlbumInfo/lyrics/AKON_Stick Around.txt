When the party's over
And the lights go down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around

I know we just met
I know we just started
But there's something here
I can tell we got it
We like a classic song
I been singing all night long
And it goes like

Oh my love
My darling
When we sober up
Will you still be mine?

When the party's over
And the lights go down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around

I know we just met
I know we just started
But there's something here
I can tell we got it
We like a classic song
I been singing all night long
And it goes like

Oh my love
My darling
When we sober up
Will you still be mine?

When the party's over
And the lights go down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around

So please stay over (stay over)
Take care of you through your hangover
Let's make love through the moonlight until the daylight
And then we both think back like: what a night
Let you decide, alright

When the party's over
And the lights go down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go I'm hoping that you stick around

The party's over
The lights go down
Hoping that you stick around
Oh sober down
Hoping that you stick around
