We disappear from our thoughts and sounds
Our features- abrasive

So many things we overlook
Is there something that we don't know?
That over time. We're over time
Wrought with dysfunction, and callous minds
So take the knife within my heart
Sharpen it with water and virtue

Oh, the mystery. Of what we wished we knew
Oh the misery. There's so much more that I could have
That I could give

Falling faster, gaining speed
Everything around me wraps me in light, precious life
Something we seem to forget, I can feel something real burning inside
Something we seem to forget, I can feel it burning inside of me

Wind exerts my lungs. The influence of my being

Weightlessness. A beautiful affection
Force its hold
Against my deep breath

Oh, the mystery. Of what we wished we knew
Oh the misery. There's so much more that I could have
That I could give
