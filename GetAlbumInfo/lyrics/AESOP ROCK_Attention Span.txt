<i>[Aesop Rock 3x]</i>
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams

<i>[Vast Aire]</i>
Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!

Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo challenge an Ox member, get a vow severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like 'Look mom, no hands!'
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like canines
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like baretts
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I dunno if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethen
You play the role/roll, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection

<i>[Chorus - Aesop Rock, Vast Aire 2x]</i>
If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the pesants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

<i>[Aesop Rock]</i>
I boogie with picketer vision 
carbon based stickler
City piss aroma therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if the sunbeams flatline via thick fatigue episodes brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed at perkes nurse broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center housing style pagents
My little limbs lasso katydid wings while mankinds babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of mass times weight times tamed semantics encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic
We edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, aprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again, It still never ended suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts, start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear, let the tears braid and skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold plated tomb or spitoon, I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
