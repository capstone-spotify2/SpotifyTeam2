The factories are all shut down
The shopping malls are all closed
The busy streets are all empty
Except for the falling snow
And in the small towns, in the cities
Families gather as one
'Cause the night of love and sharing
They've looked forward to has come

'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony

But across the seas two armies
Stare down at each other's guns
Each believing in their cause enough
To die or kill the other one
But tonight there'll be no shooting,
Not a drop of blood will spill
They will cease their fire this silent night
In the name of peace and goodwill

'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony
