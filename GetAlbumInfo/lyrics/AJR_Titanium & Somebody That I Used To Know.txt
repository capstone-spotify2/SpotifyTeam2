<i>[Jack:]</i>
You shout it loud,
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

<i>[Adam:]</i>
Iâm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

<i>[Ryan:]</i> You shoot me down but I won't fall
<i>[All:]</i> I am titanium
<i>[Ryan:]</i> You shoot me down but I won't fall
<i>[Jack:]</i> I am titanium

<i>[Jack:]</i>
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and a haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

<i>[Adam:]</i>
Iâm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

<i>[Ryan:]</i> You shoot me down but I won't fall
<i>[All:]</i> I am titanium
<i>[Ryan:]</i> You shoot me down but I won't fall
<i>[Jack:]</i> I am titanium

<i>[Ryan:]</i> No you didn't have to cut me out
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
<i>[All:]</i> But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
<i>[Jack:]</i> No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
<i>[All:]</i> Now you're just somebody that I used to know

<i>[Adam:]</i>
Iâm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

<i>[All:]</i>
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
