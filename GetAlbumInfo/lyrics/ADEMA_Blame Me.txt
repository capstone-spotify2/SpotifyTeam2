I'm always gonna be one life behind
That's why I'm all alone
What's it gonna take to make you see
That we are falling apart
I wonder can we throw away the past
So we can stop the screaming match
I'm not gonna break down anymore
I've found my way to the door

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I can see through both of us
It's an issue over trust
It's killing me it's killing me
To watch you leave

I've tried to talk about what's really wrong
I see that look of discontent
The volume starts to rise and then it's on
That's why I have to go
Dealing with the pain is all that's left
Because we can not get along
You wanna put the blame on me again
I think that we have reached the end

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I can see through both of us
It's an issue over trust
It's killing me it's killing me
To watch you leave
I can see through both of us
It's an issue over trust
You keep blaming me, blaming me
For what you do to me

It's your turn to watch me leave you
It's your turn to watch me leave you
It's your turn to watch me leave you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I can see through both of us
It's an issue over trust
It's killing me it's killing me
To watch you leave.
I can see through both of us
It's an issue over trust
You keep blaming me, blaming me
For what you do to me
