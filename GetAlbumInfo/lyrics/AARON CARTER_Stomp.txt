Steppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet

Slap me five that's the place we've arrived it's alive
Ev'rybody take it to the top we're gonna
Stomp all night in the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right gonna
Stomp all night wanna party
Till the morning light

Runnin' runnin' runnin'
The set is hot there's people wall to wall
Old ones young things short ones standing tall
So Grab the one with the smile on her face

And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone
Ev'rybody take it to the top we're gonna

Stomp all night in the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right gonna
Stomp all night wanna party
Till the morning light gonna

Stomp all night in the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right gonna
Stomp all night wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp

<i>[x 3]</i>
Stomp step down in it put your foot
Where you feel the fit
Stomp you don't want to quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

<i>[repeat - fades]</i>
Stomp all night in the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right gonna
Stomp all night wanna party
Till the morning light
