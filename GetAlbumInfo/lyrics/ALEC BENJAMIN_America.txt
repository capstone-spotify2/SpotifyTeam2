You've been hanging your conscious on the fence
Cause you can't hold it
An empty promise laid to rest
A life is stolen
And there will be no consequence
For what you broken
Don't you know, what your father said?

We are the only
We are the brave
We are America, but
We are to blame

Stand up! Stand up!
Can you hear me now?
All I! All I
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it
This up! This up!
Don't put your hands down!
All I! All I
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it

We've been biting our tongues for too long
And they know it
They told us that hope would carry on
They really had us going
And there will be no consequence
For your simple hypnosis
Don't you know, what your father said?

We are the only
We are the brave
We are America, but
We are to blame

Stand up! Stand up!
Can you hear me now?
All I! All I
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it
This up! This up!
Don't put your hands down!
All I! All I
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it
