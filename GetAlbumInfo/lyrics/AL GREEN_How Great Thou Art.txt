O Lord my God!  When I in awesome wonder 
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, 
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wonder 
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

And when I think that God, his Son not sparing, 
Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in; 
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great You are, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great You are, how great Thou art!
