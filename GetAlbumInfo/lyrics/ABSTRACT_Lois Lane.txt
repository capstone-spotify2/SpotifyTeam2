<i>[Abstract:]</i>
She said I know you want it all
You gon' get it all calm down
And if you hit the wall
I'll be here when it all falls down
If you lose your crown
If you lose your way
I'll be right here
To save the day

Clark Kent till I hit that booth, Peter Parker till I hit the web
Mary Jane ain't been the same, need that Lois Lane instead
Mary fucking with my head, every time she in my head
She a Wonder Woman, wonders why we haven't made it yet
Used to help me sleep at night, now she more my kryptonite
Got me saying fuck all that need Lois at my crib to night
Thinking I'm gon' save the world, but who the hell gon' save me right?
I said who the hell gon' save me right!?

She said I know you want it all
You gon' get it all calm down
And if you hit the wall
I'll be here when it all falls down
If you lose your crown
If you lose your way
I'll be right here
To save the day

Financially went Bruce Wayne to Parker in 'bout 4 years
But Dark Knight was rising gathered hate from my old peers
Life gave me new fears, same place just new years
Death Cab said every plans a prayer to Father Time
Thankfully lived long enough to see him grant me some of mine
So many heights that's left to view, success is just a point of view
Lois I'm gon' need you just to help me make it through
They say we're doing good but there's so much left to do
