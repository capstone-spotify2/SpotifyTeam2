So I'm feeling much worse now
You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me.

Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies.
How could you run on such, on such voltage?

All the same
I remain
The one you blame and I'm

Demonized
Purified
Justified
As you let yourself show!

So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me. (Don't! Speak!)
Love these screams like I do (My! Name!)

As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to
Ride that dirty ride

That is turning so fast now
I cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who'd want, who'd want to

All the same
I remain
The one you blame and I'm

Demonized
Purified
Justified
As you let yourself show!

So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me. (Don't! Speak!)
Love these screams like I do (My! Name!)

Don't ever speak my name

Don't ever speak my name again
Don't ever speak it
Don't ever speak my name again
Don't speak
Don't speak

DON'T
SPEAK
MY
DON'T SPEAK MY NAME!

So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me. (Don't! Speak!)
Love these screams like I do (Why)
