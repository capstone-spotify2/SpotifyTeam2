Irish blood, American heart
New York City steel
I got the transmission
I got the transmission coming

English rain, punch drunk eyes
A soul that cannot heal
I got the transmission, I got the transmission
It reads 'don't waste any time at all'

Take me to the gallows
Bring the guillotine
You wanna take my life
Oh, you wanna take my misery

Take me to the gallows
Bring me misery
You wanna take my life
Oh, you'll never take away my right to think
Go

Love suffice a chilling wind
The future doesn't look so good
We got the transmission
We've got to transmit in lieu of food

Thought police and sanctioned crime
I still see a glimmer of hope
This is the transmission, the last transmission
It reads 'don't waste any time at all'

Take me to the gallows
Bring my guillotine
You wanna take my life
Oh, you wanna take my misery

Take me to the gallows
Bring me misery
You wanna take my life
Oh, you'll never take away my right to think

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take my hand, my sorrow for loved ones
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take my hand, my sorrow for loved ones

Take me to the gallows
Bring the guillotine
You wanna take my life
Oh, you wanna take my misery

Take me to the gallows
Bring me misery
You wanna take my life
You'll never take away my right to think
No, no
