The carbon on the fingerprint 
that's lifted from the lighter's flint, 
that caused another smoker's squint, 
who sees the point but not the light;
Salvation
And rabble-rousing diatribes
revealing more for what it hides, 
who plays a little off the sides,
who swears they can sin in spite 
Of salvation

The gavel of the auctioneer
The bureau with the cracked veneer
It's going, going, gone but you're not here.
So I laughed until I cried, 
then I chose another side
when you asked me to decide 
between you and staying alive.

The horoscope says let it go,
the devil is the one you know,
the one you love's a domino,
A bull with glass and diamond eyes,
And salvation
But everywhere is two way glass
and double locks and easy pass,
turn oxygen to laughing gas,
give skeletons for Valentine's.
Salvation

The gavel of the auctioneer,
The bureau with the cracked veneer,
It's going, going, gone but you're not here.
So I laughed until I cried, 
then I chose another side
when you asked me to decide 
between you and staying alive.
