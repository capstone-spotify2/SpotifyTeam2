I met her in Caroline
Round about sixty-nine
Well she came up to me and said, "Hi there honey
How'd you like to come along"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Cause we're gonna have a party
Yeah a rock 'n' roll party
Well we're gonna have a party
And before I knew
We were rockin' in the parlour
Rockin' in the parlour

Well the next time I saw her roll
Was way down in Mexico
She said, "I've got some booze around at my place
So come along and have some fun"

<i>[Chorus]</i>
