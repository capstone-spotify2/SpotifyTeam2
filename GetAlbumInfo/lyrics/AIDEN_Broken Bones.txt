When I was fifteen
I knew that the world was our TV
We were dying out there
Thriving on the streets

I was fifteen, I knew I fucking lost the choice in appeal
Well, I paid destruction
Found decay in the comfort of the disarray
Will you buy the ticket, take the ride?

Well, journey through this hell with me
Broken bones and sorrow
Well, journey through this hell with me
I'm gonna bring you death and show you life obscene

Now it's been fifteen years
Most of us are gone or dead or in jail
Well, I found solution, paid the price
In the comfort of a cold device
Will you buy the ticket, take the ride?

Well, journey through this hell with me
Broken bones and sorrow
Well, journey through this hell with me
I'm gonna bring you death and show you life obscene

We all live in fear
Afraid of who we can be
We all live in fear
Afraid of what we are

We can shed our fear
We will shed our fear

Well, journey through this hell with me
Broken bones and sorrow
Take a trip to hell with me
Take a trip to hell
