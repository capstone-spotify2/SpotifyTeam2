When you kiss me, like you mean it
And there's no distractions
It's so real, I can feel it
In my bones, it's magic
I won't live my life, wandering
You're still here, and I'm here
And I'll never let you go
(No)

I'm gonna love you 'til the stars
Finally run out of helium
I'm gonna love you 'til the mountains crumble at our feet
I'm gonna love you 'til the sky
Finally opens up to let us in
And we'll float like helium

It's the way that you know me
And I'll always be there
If you need protection
I'll be your guardian angel
We could live our lives, wandering
Somewhere, somehow
And I hope you know
I'll never let you down

I'm gonna love you 'til the stars
Finally run out of helium
I'm gonna love you 'til the mountains crumble at our feet
I'm gonna love you 'til the sky
Finally opens up to let us in
And we'll float like helium

I'm gonna love you until the mountains fall
I swear to God we'll see it all
'Til the colors turn and fade to nothing

I'm gonna love you 'til the stars
Finally run out of helium
I'm gonna love you 'til the mountains crumble at our feet
I'm gonna love you 'til the sky
Finally opens up to let us in
And we'll float like helium
