So he's retired
Lives with his sister in a furnished flat
He's got this suit that
He'll never wear outside without a hat
His hair is white but he looks half his age
He looks like Jimmy Stewart in his younger days

And honestly
I might be stupid to think
Love is love, but I do
And you've waited so long
And I've waited long enough for you

My mother's calling
From where she's living up in Troy, Vermont
She tries to tell me
A father figure must be what I want
I've always thought age made no difference
Am I the only one to whom that's making sense?

And honestly
I might be stupid to think
Love is love, but I do
And you've waited so long
And I've waited long enough for you

The day I met him he was raking leaves
In his tiny yard

Of course I know that
We've only got ten years or twenty left
But to be honest
I'm happy with whatever time we get
Depending on whichever book you read
Sometimes it takes a lifetime to get what you need

And honestly
I might be stupid to think
Love is love, but I do
And you've waited so long
And I've waited long enough for you
