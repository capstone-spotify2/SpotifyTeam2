Thousands of hairs 
Two eyes only 
Its you 

Some skin 
Billions of genes 
Again its you 

XX XY 
That's why it's you and me 

Your blood is red 
It's beautiful genetic love 

Biological 
I don't know why I feel that way with you 
Biological 
I need your DNA 

Your fingerprints 
The flesh, her arm, your bones 
I'd like to know 
Why all these things move me 

Let's use ourselves to be as one tonight 
Apart of me would like to travel in your veins 

Biological 
I don't know why I feel that way with you 
Biological 
I need your DNA
