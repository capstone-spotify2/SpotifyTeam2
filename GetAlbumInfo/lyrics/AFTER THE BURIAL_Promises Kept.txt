This is my promise to write to you
So for you my every word
Is the sinking feeling here in my chest
I am so far from home but the further away we are the closer I am
The closer I feel, the further you get
My hands hold on tight to your every word
I won't let go, but I feel my eyes advert from who I used to be
We know the storms will come
The winds they will sweep us all away
Wrap me in your silver lining
Torn between the roots of earth and the sky
I left my heart behind, and I'm so far from home
The weight is pulling me down, in your circles I am spinning
In your circles I'll wait forever
Lost control, my hands grip the wheel
But I can't see where the road is leading
Please hold on dear I know you're worried
Counting down the days do you remember?
Torn between the earth and the sky, I left my heart behind
