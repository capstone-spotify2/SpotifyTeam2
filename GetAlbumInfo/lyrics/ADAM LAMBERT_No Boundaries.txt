Ohhh hmmm...
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way
And what if my chances were already gone
I started believing that I could be wrong
But you gave me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
So here I am still holding on

With every step you climb another mountain
With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going no where
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries...
There are no boundaries

I fought to the limit, to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
Jumped every bridge
Run every line
I risk being safe
I always knew why
I always knew why
So here I am still holding on

With every step you climb another mountain
With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
When you think the road is going no where
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries above and beneath you
Break every rule 'cause there's nothing between you and your dreams

With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going no where
Just when you almost gave up everything
They take you by the hand
And show you that you can
'Cause there are no boundaries... ehh eh
(There are no boundaries)
There are no boundaries... yeah ehh
There are no boundaries... ehh eh
(There are no boundaries)
There are no boundaries... Yeah eh

There are no boundaries
