Take everything away from me silent angel...

Apathy cries out from your lungs, indifference reeks of fiction
Time will tell how far you will go
I can't see why you'd run and hide excluding such complacence
As tears rain from bloodshot eyes

Take everything away from me silent angel
Leave me nothing to remind me of this time now lost

The air now reeks with the presence of your vile voice
As your smile masks the advance you keep
...I am not your trophy...
The air now reeks with the presence of your vile voice
As your smile masks the advance you keep
...I am not your trophy...

Please try to say more carefully that you no longer need me
This back and forth is killing me
The only eyes you'll look into are those in your reflection
You are the means to my end

This conversation is over, it's over...
Your truth is a deception meant to poison me

Take everything away from me silent angel
Leave me nothing to remind me of this time now lost

I can't seem to believe that you ever cared for me
...This conversation is over...
Your empty words now drift away as fragile whispers
I saw the day when the fire left your eyes, your tongue fell still
Your treason is silence...

Take everything away from me silent angel
Leave me nothing to remind me of this time now lost
