Only yesterday
I had in my hands
Something special, I know
But time keeps spinning
Now we got nowhere to go
So I'm trying to forget
Forget about it

I've been trynna' get you out my head
I've been thinking 'bout you every day
I can see you talking with your eyes only
I can see it in your face (You're sending signals to me)
Wearing my favourite perfume (You're sending signals to me)
If all the little things you do (You're sending signals to me)
And I know I shouldn't let you up in my head
But I can't help myself when I see (You're sending signals to me)

Pictures in my head
Reminding me of you
Forgetting most of them, but I keep a few
And now it's harder to forget
Forget about you

I've been trynna' get you out my head
I've been thinking 'bout you every day
I can see you talking with your eyes only
I can see it in your face (You're sending signals to me)
Wearing my favourite perfume (You're sending signals to me)
If all the little things you do (You're sending signals to me)
And I know I shouldn't let you up in my head
But I can't help myself when I see (You're sending signals to me)

(You're sending signals to me)
(You're sending signals to me)
(You're sending signals to me)
(You're sending signals to me)

Wearing my favourite perfume (You're sending signals to me)
If all the little things you do (You're sending signals to me)
And I know I shouldn't let you up in my head
But I can't help myself when I see (You're sending signals to me)
