I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why
without you it's hard to survive

'cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side

'cause everytime we touch I feel the static
and everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Your arms are my castle your heart is my sky
they wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side

'cause everytime we touch I feel the static
and everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat so I can't let you go
Want you in my life

'cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side
