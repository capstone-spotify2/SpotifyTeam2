I've been down and out, but never this low before
And sometimes felt left out, but
never outside your door
We've been far apart, but never this far, oh girl
I can't bridge this distance, baby, anymore

If you love me, then show me
But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you
want to do with your life
And leave me alone
'Cause I'm crying for your lovin'
And I'm hoping that this feeling will die
But if it don't, then girl, you've ruined my world
For the last time

I've got this damn thing called love
I've got it for ya
But it just ain't enough
So I just watch my heart break
With every chance I take with you, with you
I'm out of my mind for love
Giving you all just ain't enough
What am I supposed to do
To get with you, baby
Yes other girls have been good to me
But they never did the things you did for love
I guess you must have had to love me a lot
To spare the pain that you could rid me of
We've grown so far apart
From used to be so intertwined

No more love you baby
In the middle of the night
If you love me, well then show me
But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you
want to do with your life
Just leave me alone
'Cause I'm crying for your lovin'
And I'm hoping that this feeling will die
But if it don't, then girl, you've ruined my world
For the last time

If you love me, then you'll show me
But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you
want to do with your life
Leave me alone
But I'm crying for your lovin'
And I'm hoping that this feeling will subside
But if it don't, then girl, you've ruined my world
For the last time...
