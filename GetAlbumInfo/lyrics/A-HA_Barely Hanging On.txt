I used to be so sensible on my own
Now I'm so sensitive it's a joke
I'm getting by on decibels like a drug
And greet every brand
New day with a shrug

I'm barely hanging on

I used to be so comfortable in a suit
Almost presentable next to you
I used to be so confident in a crowd
Now I can't say my own name aloud

I'm barely hanging on

And now I guess you're
Wondering why
We never could see eye to eye
Oh but never mind
And now I guess it's hard to see
What has gotten into me
Oh but never mind

I'm barely hanging on
