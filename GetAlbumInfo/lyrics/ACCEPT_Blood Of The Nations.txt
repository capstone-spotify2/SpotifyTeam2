For the right to be free... We pay the wages of war
For our dreams and ideals... All that's worth fighting for
For Honor and Duty... Nations we will defend
Securing our safety and peace... We fight to the end

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
As allies we stand, in far away lands
Heeding the battle cry
We pay the price, with great sacrifice
The fuel of freedoms' fire

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Together we fight... (For the blood of the nations)
Warriors on demand
We kill and we die... (For the blood of the nations)
It's a noble cause... And the blood is on their hands

We leave behind our homes... to ensure our way of life
To avenge our brothers murders... and stand up for what is right
For our countries and our future... our legions carry on
A war against the terror... that we did not bring upon

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
As allies we stand... in hostile lands
So the masses can be free
We pay the price... with great sacrifice
That's the way it has to be

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Together we fight... (For the blood of the nations)
We are brothers hand in hand
We kill and we die... (For the blood of the nations)
Cos' war is hell
We pay with our lives... (For the blood of the nations)
Cos' freedom isn't free
We bleed and we cry... (for the blood of the nations)
A Soldier's Lot... And here we'll make our stand

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Together we fight... (For the blood of the nations)
Warriors on demand
We kill and we die... (For the blood of the nations)
It's a noble cause

We pay with our lives... (For the blood of the nations)
Cos' freedom isn't free
We bleed and we cry... (for the blood of the nations)
A soldier's lot...

...(Blood of the nations)
We pay with our lives... (For the blood of die nations)
...Cos' war is hell
