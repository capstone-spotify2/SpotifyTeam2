And the words they take their meaning (It's all you said)
and the flame, it loses colour (It's all you said)
Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said)

Knowing that it's far from over
This one belongs to you

Time shows us that all that ever mattered
all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold
If you ever believe this is what you need
it will spin around and shatter
throw you to the floor
as it leaves us in the cold

And the dream you think I'm making
while the house I built is breaking
Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said)

Knowing that it's far from over
this one belongs to you

Time shows us that all that ever mattered
all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold
If you ever believe this is what you need
it will spin around and shatter
throw you to the floor
as it leaves us in the cold

I remember the train you came in on
Everything I want kept calling
I remember the chill that came over
Everything I love went falling

Time shows us that all that ever mattered
all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold
If you ever believe this is what you need
it will spin around and shatter
throw you to the floor
as it leaves us in the cold
