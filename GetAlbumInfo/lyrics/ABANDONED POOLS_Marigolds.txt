Calling this a win
Still here and floating in the wind
We seem to ebb and flow
Always coming close
But then no go
We ebb and flow
A life in slow reverse

Bringing out the guns
Blow this house of cards to kingdom come
We seem to ebb and flow
Always coming close
But then no go
This house of cards
A life in slow reverse

I overflow
And say hello
To a world of marigolds
Heaven knows
Heaven knows
When itâs time to get your
Sea legs back again
Dive into the depths of the ocean
Heaven knows
Heaven knows
Just like something I used to know
