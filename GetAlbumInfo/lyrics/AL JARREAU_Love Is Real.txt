You think that love
is just a fairy tale
Maybe true love is sold
and bought
Hansel and Gretel found
their candy getting stale
And you're gonna find
You ain't no Goldilocks

When those bells just
keep on ringing
And that song you're singing
And you want to share
your Mondays-
Right through to Sundays
Your best friend is softly speakin'
She won't call this weekend
No way-it's only a fling you say
But
Love is real, yes it is girl
Never let anyone
tell you different
when you can feel it
Love is real, yes it is mama
Never let anyone
tell you different
When you can feel this
feeling's for real

Let me tell you something
Don't go away
Don't you stray
Let me tell you something
Don't go away
Don't you stray

You think that love's
What's on that silver screen
Raquel and Redford are the tops
You've been misled
by all those movies you've seen
Love ain't a robber
Hidin' from the cops

When you toss 'n' turn all morning
And you wake up yawning
And you walk that floor all evening
And you should be leaving
And you find yourself pretending
You've got a happy ending-
No way-it's only a fling you say
But
