Now
Let's burn the memories
Now
Let's burn the whole world down

Let's burn it down

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
My final nail, my coffin
This is my spirit haunting
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
My final tale I offer
This is my last chance to kill you

The old forsaken you were saved
Woke up from a nightmare
It's raining in hell
Raining in hell
The knives have sharpened on this plate
Your fiction written on our face
It's just a disguise
It's some kind of hate, hate, hate

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I still get nightmares often
These are my demons haunting
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Another failed zombie
I'm the cold, I'm the knife I used to kill you
