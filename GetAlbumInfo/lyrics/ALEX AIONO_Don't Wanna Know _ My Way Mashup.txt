Why wait to say, at least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

You are the one thing in my way <i>[12x]</i>

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
<i>[2x]</i>

We used to kick it on your nights off
Couple drinks with the lights off
Now I'm sitting with the mic on, trying to tell everybody where the hell we went wrong
So where you at, what's new?
My friends tell me what you're doing and it just ain't you
Man, you got me ever wondering if I ever knew
All there is to know about you, did I not have a clue?

And I couldn't help but open up your Instagram
It's been a minute girl
(We don't talk anymore)
So I don't know if you're messing with another man
And I'm curious but maybe I don't wanna know
'Cause he irreplaceable, call you 'Queen B'
And I really wish the feeling was reciprocated
'Cause it's getting really lonely under these sheets
So when I tell you that I miss you it's an understatement

I don't wanna know, hey-ey
You are the one thing baby
Loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
You are the one thing in my way <i>[4x]</i>
