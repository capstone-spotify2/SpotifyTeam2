When we come into this world
And we hunger for that touch
From the one that brought us life
From the one that gave so much

Innocence will take your hand
And speak though the one thought in your mind

Don't you know that love is all
Love is where we all begin
And when we knock on heaven's door
Only love will let us in

And as we gather to ourselves
A part of everything we see
We realize that what we own
Isn't what we really need

Innocence take my hand
And speak through the one thought in your mind

Don't you know that love is all
Love is where we all begin
And when we knock on heaven's door
Only love will let us in

Don't you know that love is all
Love is all that we must do
It is the reason why we live
Love is all I have for you

True love cannot be broken
Through all the tears and pain
Only one truth survives, only one truth remains

Don't you know that love is all
Love is where we all begin
And when we knock on heaven's door
Only love will let us in

Don't you know that love is all
Love is all that we must do
It is the reason why we live
Love is all I have for you

Don't you know that love is all
Love is where we all begin
And when we knock on heaven's door
Only love will let us in
