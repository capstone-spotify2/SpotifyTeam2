You say you adore me,
but your eyes tell a story I've heard before.
And damn boy you must think I'm dumb
as if I didn't know about the things you've done.

Got a girl in every city,
but somehow you're still lonely.
I'm not the one to sit around waiting by my phone
while you're wasted telling other girls they're beautiful.

So why don't we just call it what it is?
We both know we're getting what we give.

You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way.
I say what you don't wanna say:
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late.

Don't say you wanna stay forever.
We both know that I know you better.
You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk...
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

I say I don't want this,
but I know that I miss you when you're gone
and being tangled up in those sheets
but I know that you're not what's good for me.

So why don't we just call it what it is?
'Cause everybody knows you're full of shit.

You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way.
I say what you don't wanna say:
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late.

Don't say you wanna stay forever.
We both know that I know you better.
You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk...
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

Baby you know all you do
is keep talking me back to you.
Your words don't mean a thing
'cause I'm done listening.

All you do is talk
All you do is talk
All you ever do is talk, talk, talk, talk 

You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way.
I say what you don't wanna say:
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late.

Don't say you wanna stay forever.
We both know that I know you better.
You say you really wanna change,
but all you do is talk, talk, talk...
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

Talk, talk, talk, yeah
