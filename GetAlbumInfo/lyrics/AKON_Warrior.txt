I was running away from myself
Had a barrel inside of my head
I was lying awake in my bed
Thinking 'bout all the things I should have said

But now I'm stronger, I'm so much stronger
No more running, not any longer
And now I'm stronger, and finally I can say
That I'm not afraid, yeah

I'm gonna break the silence
Cut like a laser through the dark
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid, no
I'm gonna fight the triads
They are no chains around my heart
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid, I'm not afraid

Wish that you could be here with me now
I've overcome the demons inside, yeah
I keep hearing your voice late at night
Telling me, gotta fight for your right

But now I'm stronger, I'm so much stronger
No more running, not any longer
And now I'm stronger, and finally I can say
That I'm not afraid, yeah

I'm gonna break the silence
Cut like a laser through the dark
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid, no
I'm gonna fight the triads
They are no chains around my heart
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid

No, they can't hold me down
Seen it rising up from the ground
No, they can't hold me down
Seen it rising up from the ground
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down

<i>[Akon:]</i>
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid
