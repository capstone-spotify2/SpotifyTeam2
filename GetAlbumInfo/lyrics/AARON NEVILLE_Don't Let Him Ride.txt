Don't let the devil ride,
Oh, don't let the devil ride,
If you let the devil ride,
He will want to drive,
Don't let him ride

Don't let him flag you down
Oh, oh, don't you let him flag you down
If he flags you down, he turns your soul around
Don't let him ride

Don't you let him be your boss
Don't you let him be your boss
If you let him be your boss,
Your soul will be lost,
Don't let him ride

Don't let him drive your car
Don't you let him drive your car
If you let him drive your car,
He's sure to go too far
Don't let him drive

Don't let him call your name
Don't you let him call your name
If you let him call your name
You get there just the same
Don't let him ride

Don't let the devil ride
Don't you let the devil ride
Don't you let the devil ride
Don't you let the devil ride
Don't you let the devil ride
Don't you let the devil ride (don't)
