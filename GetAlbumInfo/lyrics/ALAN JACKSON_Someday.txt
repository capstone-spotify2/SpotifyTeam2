She looked me in the eye and said it's over
I can't take this heartache, anymore
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before

And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
There's nothin' in this world, I wouldn't do
Just give me time, I'll be the man you've needed
She said I wish that I could take that, for the truth

And I said someday, I'll get my life straight
And she said it's too late, what's done is done
And I told her someday, she said I can't wait
'Cause sometimes someday, just never comes

She said all I've ever wanted, was to love you
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
But now I think it's time I stopped believin'
'Cause I'm never gonna see a change in you

And I said someday, I'll get my life straight
And she said it's too late, what's done is done
And I told her someday, she said I can't wait
'Cause sometimes someday just never comes

Sometimes someday just never comes
