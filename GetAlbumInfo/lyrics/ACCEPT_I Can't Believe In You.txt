I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - no!

I remember the times
When we were young
And all we did was just for fun
And I loved you - ooh - how I loved you

But now you've changed
A face the same
Felt so sure
No doubt in my mind

But tonight I've got this crazy feeling
I've never left before
You've got my senses reelin'
You shouldn't lie to me

I can't believe in you - even though I try
I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - don't give me all you lies
I can't believe in you - believe in you - believe in you

I laid you down and I set you free
Suddenly you opened up
And I loved you
Oh I loved you

Say you don't need me in the things I do
But I gave more than any fool could do
Still don't know what really blinded me
What really blinded me

I can't believe in you - on you I can't rely girl
I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - even though I try
I can't believe in you

But tonight I've got this crazy feeling
I've never left before
You've got my senses reelin'
You shouldn't lie to me

I can't believe in you - even though I try
I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - no matter how I try

I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - even though I try
I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - girl - get away from me - yeah

I can't believe in you
I can't believe in you - get away - I don't believe you've told
I can't believe in you - yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
I can't believe in you

I can't believe in you,...
