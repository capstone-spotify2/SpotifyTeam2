Been slaving all week lone but now Friday's here 
I'm gonna blow my paycheck on whiskey women 
And beer 
I got no security or college degree 
Coz if I had just one wish baby I'd make all liquor free 

I don't know where I am and I just don't care 
I just don't care 
I can't stop now I'm goin over the edge 
Case I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle again 
You know I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the battle 
Back on the bottle again 

Baby I'm hotwired like a stolen car 
My heart's pumping like a jack hammer 
Right now one can tell me what to do 
As long I'm drinkin' I keep on kickin' cause baby 
It's what I do 

I don't know where I am and I just don't care 
I just don't care 
I can't stop now I'm goin over the edge 

Case I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle again 
You know I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the battle 
Back on the bottle again 
You know I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle again 
I said I'm ack on the bottle 
Back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle again 
You know I'm back on the bottle 
Back on the bottle 
Beer wine whiskey and gin, tequila alright 

I'm back, I'm back I'm back on the bottle again 
I'm back, I'm back I'm back on the bottle again 
I'm back, I'm back I'm back on the bottle again 
I'm back, I'm back I'm back on the bottle again
