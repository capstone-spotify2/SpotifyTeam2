get yourself cooler, lay yourself low 
coincidental murder, with nothing to show 
with the judge, constipation will go to his head 
and his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead 

it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 
it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 

gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun 
<i>[alt: shady lookin' loser, you played with my gun]</i> 
no smoothy face laywer to getcha undone 
say love ain't the same on the south side of town 
you could look, but you ain't gonna find it around 

it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 
it's the same old story, same old story 
same old song and dance 

fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin' 
your old time connection, change your direction 
ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it 
can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend 

when you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street 
with your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet 
say love ain't the same, on the south side of town 
you could look, but you ain't gonna find it around
