<i>[Spoken:]</i>
"You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Well, one of these days I'm gonna climb that mountain".

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway.

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn.
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreamin' again.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway.

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man.
Spend the day bein' lazy, just bein' nature's friend.
Climb a long tall hick'ry. Bend it over, skinnin' cats.
Playin' baseball with chert rocks, usin' sawmill slabs for bats.

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart.
Play something with lots of feelin',
'Cause that's where music has to start.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey hey.

Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
