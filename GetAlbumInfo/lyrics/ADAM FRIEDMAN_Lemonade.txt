I went down to Georgia, looking for the one
I even checked in New York City, I didn't have no luck
So I'm going to S.C., where all you pretty girls are hiding
I got my old school Chevy, and my labrador
Headed down to the liquor store
Begging

California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade

Ooooooh, ooooooh, ohhhhhhhh

I got that good cologne
And I got that charm
I just need a pretty Cali girl
To put under my arm
And I know what you need darlin'
But I need it too
A little love and affection all night long
I got a whole bunch for you
I'm going out to

California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade

Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
There ain't nobody else to hold (no)
Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
There ain't no other place to go
But

California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade
California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade
5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade
