They say
History will find us on the, last train
And we'll make all the same mistakes that they made
And we will never rule tomorrow
Our way out
Love...

I don't claim to know
All I'm in for, I hear about the top get lost in the info
Feel like I'm a inch tall
I got some stories to go

Say I'm in the building
Know my rhymes still grind at the floor
Underground flow
I ain't even penetrated that

Couple million know me but how many rappers know i rap
Struggle making sense of that
How many hits I gotta smash?
I feel like I'm slept on, I ain't where the mattress at

I be where the matches at
I'm just trynna light the shit
Dedicate the past 5 years of my life to it
Excuse me if I sound desperate

But I ain't trynna live my damn life behind a desk bitch
I been working harder than the hardest that you know
If we're talking rappers there's too many that I know

So I became the artist that I always know I been
Started singing hooks got busy on producing shit

They say
History will find us on the, last train
And we'll make all the same mistakes that they made
And we will never rule tomorrow
Our way out
Love...

And this is not the album
This is just a preview
Die a legend tatted on my arm that's how I'll leave you
I ain't out for nothing less

Learning what I'm up against
I suggest you start routing for us if you on the fence
Won't apologize this the rapper in me
The part of me that put these retro 5s on my feet
I swear I been on tracks like I run it with cleats

Whole team on fire look who running with me
I ain't mean to stunt on all my peers right now
But the way you shining ain't what it appears right now
If I dropped names disappear: careers right now

I'll let time tell counting on the years right now
You can't neglect it
I wreck it can't second guess what it is
I won't be phony homie know we trynna be the best in the biz

Normally on the realer shit
I swear this the realist shit
This a warning shot
I'm on my come up hope you fearing it

They say
History will find us on the, last train
And we'll make all the same mistakes that they made
And we will never rule tomorrow
Our way out
Love...

It's too late now
