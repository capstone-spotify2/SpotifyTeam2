Stand
For the silence and the broken ones
For the families who have lost someone
You have a voice

Stand
I'll follow shadows unveil who you are
Light the candle and don't fear the dark
No matter how small
When you've got the call

Be brave
Shine all your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight

Be brave
Be brave
Yeahâ¦

Tonight
We celebrate our love for you
Cause you've given us so much of you
For every single sacrifice
You have paid the price
And where
Wherever you may go
I know that you can make it so
Don't give up the fight
Don't turn off the light

Be brave
Shine all your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight

Be brave
Be brave
Yeahâ¦

We are one
We are loved
Let a stranger nod at us
An undivided us
Let's stand and swear

Be brave
Shine all your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight

Be brave
Be brave
Yeahâ¦
