Well, I guess that this is now the end
Who'd have thought, my old friend
We signed the papers and we capped the pen

But I remember you from way back when
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Welcome David-what's-his-name-again

Things change, the old clichÃ©
If we knew now what we knew yesterday
Oh, we couldn't give it away

I was working at a record store
I knew you, you knew the score
Some kind of deal is what we're looking for

Time came, and disappeared
No one steered and it got weirder
Help was needed, no one volunteered

Things change, you got to wait a bit
What made me think that I could weather it?
You're down before you even know that
You've been hit

And through it all I wondered
Where the bus was taking you
Who knew?
Cause even though my one and one
Was always making two
I never thought that I was breaking you

We were victims of the old taboo
But people change, we changed too
Just make it count before they get to you

Cause things change, baby, hold the phone
They'll shoot you down like you was Al Capone
Oh, you better go it alone

Well, I guess that this is now the end
Paper signed, forget the pen
Wonder if we'll ever meet again?
