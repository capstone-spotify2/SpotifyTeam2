See, I'm just a man
I got these troubles, I'm making plans
Know there's really nothing but you

Keeps me awake and I
Think of another way we can fuss and fight
There must be somewhere I can get through

I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days

There's a war going on in my heart
I got a battle kicking off in my heart
There's a war going on in my heart

No, there's really nothing if I know I can't have you
Well, could I be forgiven for the things I put you through?
See, I'm just a man trying to understand what I'll do, I do to you

Lying in an empty bed
All my mistakes running around my head
There's nothing I can honestly say

Don't think before I speak
My mind is strong but my heart is weak
I'm not the only one who's made this way

I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days
I have not slept for days

No, there's really nothing if I know I can't have you
Well, could I be forgiven for the things I put you through?
See, I'm just a man trying to understand what I'll do
See, I'm just a man trying to understand what I'll do, do to you

There's a war going on in my heart
I got a battle kicking off in my heart
There's a war going on in my heart
I got a battle kicking off in my heart

There's a war going on in my heart
I got a battle kicking off in my heart
There's a war going on in my heart
I got a war going on

No, there's really nothing if I know I can't have you
Well, could I be forgiven for the things I put you through?
See, I'm just a man trying to understand what I'll do
See, I'm just a man trying to understand what I'll do, do to you

Do to you
