Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll not say my last good bye
Whoa, so don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
'cause I'll return someday

So don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' no, no don't weep
My heart tells me you're in love with me
Whoa, so don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' don't weep
'cause I'll return someday soon

(to take you in my arms) and to squeeze you tight
(to capture all your charms) every, every, every day now
Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' no don't cry
I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, no don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll return someday, someday soon (someday soon)

Whoa, don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't, don't you cry
'cause I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, don't cry, no, no, no, don't cry
