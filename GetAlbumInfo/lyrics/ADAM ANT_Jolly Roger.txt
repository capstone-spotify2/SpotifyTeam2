In days of old, when ships were bold
Just like the men who sailed them
And if they showed us disrespect
We'd tie them up and flail them
Often men of low degree
And often men of steel
They'd make you walk the plank alone
Or haul you 'round the keel

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Hoist the Jolly Roger
Hoist the Jolly Roger
Hoist the Jolly Roger
It's your money that we want
And your money we shall have

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Of all the pirates on the seas
The worst of them was Blackbeard
So damnable a fiend from Hell
He was the one they most feared
Any man who sailed with him
Was taking quite a chance
He'd hang them from the gallows
Just to see if they could dance (ha, ha)

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
