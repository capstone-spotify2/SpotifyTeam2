Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat
Losing you has led me to believe
Everything I love is killin' me

Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
'Cause everything I love is killin' me

I guess I made a big mistake
Thinkin' you're a habit I can break
Well, I'm addicted to you now I see
Everything I love is killin' me

Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
'Cause everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love gonna have to give up
'Cause everything I love is killin' me
