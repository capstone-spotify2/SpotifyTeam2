I can see you watching me, looking like you
wannabe, meet me on the dancefloor
Blinded by the flashing light, it's too crowded here tonight, this can be a good go

We can pretend this love that makes us come together, oh
Or we can make tonight something to be remembered, ohh

Like a fire to the flame, boy I need to know tell me more (more more)
Love run though my veins, boy you got me thinking give me more (more more)

Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies

You can step up to the play, take it to another place, meet me by the exit door
Show me you can take the lead, gas pedal full speed, promise me we'll lose control

We can pretend this love that makes us come together, oh
Or we can make tonight something to be remembered, ohh

Like a fire to the flame, boy I need to know tell me more (more more)
Love run though me veins, boy you got me thinking give me more (more more)

Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies

Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah (baby sweet little lies)
oh yeah

We can pretend this love that makes us come together, oh
Or we can make tonight something to be remembered, ohh

Like a fire to the flame, boy I need to know tell me more
Love run though my veins, boy you got me thinking give me more (more more)

Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, sweet little lies, sweet little lies
