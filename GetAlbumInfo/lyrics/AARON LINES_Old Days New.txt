It's Friday night, county road
Seventeen, off we go
It's summertime, not a care in the world
Well I remember

My two best friends and me
Takin' a trip to feel the ocean breeze
Nothing but dreams as far as we could see
Oh I remember

When fillin' that tank would seem like such a big deal
And how the wind in my hair with the sun coming up made me feel

Oh well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not so long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new

Jenny Thompson, our first date
I showed up early, she made me wait
Clumsy conversation with her dad
Well I remember

That bright red dress, the perfect fit
A romantic movie that I let her pick
We were both in the dark dreaming of love
Oh I remember

How her head on my shoulder seemed like such a big deal
And how the touch of her hand and that very first kiss made me feel, yeah

Well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new

Well I've got a thousand reasons to smile these days
I've got a thousand great memories that I can't replace
But when there's weight on my shoulders and tears on my face
Even years from now I know I'll say

I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new

I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
