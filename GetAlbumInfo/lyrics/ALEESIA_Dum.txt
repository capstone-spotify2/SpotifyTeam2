Look in the mirror
And I notice these bags under my eyes
But these bags designer
Rocking yesterday's liner
We flippin ruby red cups but we filling em with champagne
Fading with the soleil
We'll be seeing stars tonight

Live for the weekend
Sis got her weave in
Got my acrylics on
Liver been drinking
Taking a beating
Dizzy on disco drunk

It's gonna be a good night
Feel kaleidoscope dreams on the floor
We throwing up the peace signs
Till I can't feel my veins anymore
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum

Dance in the middle of the street so we can get a good photo
I'll probably drop my phone though
Might be broke but we still fly

Maxing my VISA
Shooting tequila
I swear I'm only buzzed
Liver been drinking
Taking a beating
Dizzy on disco drunk

It's gonna be a good night
Feel kaleidoscope dreams on the floor
We throwing up the peace signs
Till I can't feel my veins anymore
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum

We shaking bones till they ache
We leaving with who we came
We shaking bones till they ache
We leaving with who we came

Lipstick is bleeding
Everyone's feening
Need a McDonald's run
Liver been drinking
Taking a beating
Dizzy on disco drunk

It's gonna be a good night
Feel kaleidoscope dreams on the floor
We throwing up the peace signs
Till I can't feel my veins anymore
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum
We got so dum dee dum dum dum

We get so dum

We shaking bones till they ache
We leaving with who we came
We shaking bones till they ache
We leaving with who we came
