The walls of my mind
Are closin' in
Can't get away
Your mem'ry won't end
Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.

Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.
Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.

I still see your eyes
Your warm gentle smile
It was all worthwhile
Each moment we knew
Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.

Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.
Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.

Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.
Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you.
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.

Can't forget about you.
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue...
