Spot you first what you walked in my frequency
Got the thirst for your love, song even to me
Technology sing out to me, you're the first rest returned
Storing memory
Sing me now, you're receiving what I'm transporting
Electronic, super-sonic I'm like a machine
Emergency, low battery

Oh, boy you know I got you right in my system
And now your problem to send you transmitions
Tonight, I got you right in my system
A multimedia remote communication, tonight tonight

Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah

It's all digital, tonight
We direct our process like a CPU
Some dance, no defense
They're no substitute
Like a machine turn up that speed
I confess, it's complex
But you're all I need
Sing me now, you're receiving what I'm transporting
Electronic, super-sonic I'm like a machine
Emergency, low battery

Oh, boy you know I got you right in my system
And now your problem to send you transmitions
Tonight, I got you right in my system
A multimedia remote communication, tonight tonight

Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah

You know that it's logical what we got
So mechanical, we're riding through the network all the ways
You know that I lose control, electric start to fall
And I know that I'll never be the same, never the same!

Oh, boy you know I got you right in my system
And now your problem to send you transmitions
Tonight, I got you right in my system
A multimedia remote communication, tonight tonight

Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
Digital digital, digital digital yeah
