They can make things worse for me
Sometimes I'd rather die
They can tell me lots of things
But I can't see eye to eye
Well, I know they know the way I think
I know they always will
But someday I'm gonna change my mind
Sometimes I'd rather kill

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Bloodstains - speed kills
Fast cars - cheap thrills
Rich girls - fine wine
I've lost my sense - I've lost control - I've lost my mind

Things seem so much different now
The scene has died away
I haven't got a steady job
And I've got no place to stay
Well, it's a futuristic modern world
But things aren't what they seem
Someday you'd better wake up
From this stupid fantasy

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Solo]</i>
