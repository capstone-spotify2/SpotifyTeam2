I'm dreaming tonight of a place do I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back, I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me, oh
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam
I want you to know
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams, oh

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Oh,

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam, oh
I want to be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
