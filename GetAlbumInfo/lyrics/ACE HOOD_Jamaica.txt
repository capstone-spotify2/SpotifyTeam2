I just got back from Jamaica, Jamaica
Just smoked a pound of that Jamaica, Jamaica
I'm on the move, now see you later, later
Just smoked a pound of that Jamaica, Jamaica
You pussy niggas just some haters, some haters
I need my dough, don't do no favors, no favors
Just copped a crib that's on some acres, some acres
I fucked yo bitch and now she famous, she famous
Aye I just got back from Jamaica

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I swear to God I woke up on the gully side
And all they know is motherfuckin homicide
Murda, just keep the burna
A couple keys will get you shot,
Watch who you servin, watch who you servin,
Police lurkin, oh yea they lurkin
They seven deep in that excursion, in that excursion
Keep 20 thousand in my pockets, that's in my pockets
Ain't talkin money switch the topic, I switch the topic
I pull up in that brand new Gatti, bitch I got it
I fuck these niggas, word to Gotti, just catchin profit
I know some youngins catchin bodies, they catchin bodies
They 17 and got no daughters, ain't got no daughters
Oh my goodness, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
My Rollie cost a couple birdies, a couple birdies
I want a billion fore I'm 40, before I'm 40
They aks me do I smoke that killa? Know what I'm talkin?

A hunnit killas with me in Mavado nigga
I'm king of the south and ain't got a lot of niggas
Wake up, go get yo cake up
I blew 100 racks in Jacob, that's only Jacob's
Don't give a fuck, I do it major, I do it major
These bitches watch me like I'm cable, just like I'm cable
And fuck yo life, that shit's a fable, it's all a fable
I show you millions on the table, that's on the table
And can't no other nigga stop me, you'll never stop me
I'm shittin on em, never sloppy, apologizing
Aye check yo Twitter, guess who dreamin, bitch we the hottest,
Bitch we the bidness and the realest, ain't nothing modest,
I swear to God I tried to tell er
We set the standards, we set the standards motherfucker
Better learn some manners

And Papi aks me do I got it, you know the answer
