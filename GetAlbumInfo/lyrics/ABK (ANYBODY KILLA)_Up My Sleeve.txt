<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve

<i>[Anybody Killa:]</i>
Watch out! Hey, something's lurking, staring right at you
I can feel your souls been waiting to let all my spirits through
So many faces on my spin
Words I write, remembering
All these legends that we speak
Stories told, draw minds in deep
Who can face the blackest cloud,
When lightening strikes on solid ground
Who will be left, to see the mist
Of afterlife, and happiness
Up my sleeve, there's so many things
Who knows what this killer brings?
Hypnotized, inside your mind
But still you can't see me

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Here I go again, another check
Nobody knows what the fuck I'm after
Now you see me now you can't, disappear
Why you think ABK is so weird?
But fuck that, I got warrior skills!
I can vanish like that, *snap* for real!
Swoosh Gone! Like a dollar bill.
I'll have you're ass shiverin' with chills

<i>[Break:]</i>
I'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight
I'll these visions, I keep havin', want to take my breath away
Non-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing
Up my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Break:]</i>
I'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight
(CAN'T GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT)
I'll these visions I keep havin', want to take my breath away
(TAKE MY BREATH AWAY)
Non-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing
(THIS WORLD KEEPS CHANGING)
Up my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying
(Keep you from decaying...)
