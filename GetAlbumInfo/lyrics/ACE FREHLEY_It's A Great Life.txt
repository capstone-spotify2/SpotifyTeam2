To the left, to the right
We think we're okay
We walk, we talk, forget where we're going
We lose our way
We love, we laugh, we act like we're happy
If just for a day 

Now times have changed, so don't be fooled
You've got to remember, you gotta be cool
There's too many forces you can't control
You better think twice before you're too old 

It's great life, if you don't weaken
I've paid a high price for all I've done wrong
It's great life, if you don't weaken
My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song 

We feel, we touch, we see other people
We put on a smile
We come, we go, with so much frustration
Accepting denial 

The time has come, you must stand tall
You've just arrived, can't conquer it all
The sun has set, the tide's begun
Your ship has sailed, what have you become? 

It's great life, if you don't weaken
I've paid a high price for all I've done wrong
It's great life, if you don't weaken
My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song
My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song

Now times have changed, so don't be fooled
You've got to remember, you gotta be cool 

It's great life, if you don't weaken
I've paid a high price for all I've done wrong
It's great life, if you don't weaken
My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song

It's great life, if you don't weaken
I've paid a high price for all I've done wrong
It's great life, if you don't weaken
My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song

My Daddy told me, so I wrote this song
My Daddy told me, so wrote this song
