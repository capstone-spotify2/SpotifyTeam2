You put your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You've been digging all around
While you're messing about

Better catch her name
Come on in
Gimme that thing
That thing gone wild

War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE

Make a stand show your hand
Calling a high command
Don't think just demand
I'm like a bird of prey

Better catch her name
Come on in
Gimme that thing
That thing gone wild

War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE

Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck know the score
They're taken by surprise
And here's mud in your eyes

Let's erase the name
That you should have forgove
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild

War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE

That thing gone wild

War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE
War Machine WAR MACHINE
