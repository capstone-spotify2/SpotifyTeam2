I've had one of those days, good for nothing kinda days
I've had hard luck, bad luck and no luck at all
Girl I need you to be my soft place to fall

So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I'll turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay, kiss my worries away, far away
I've had one of those days, good for nothing kinda days
Baby I need one of your nights

I long to hold you tight, fine wine and candlelight
I've had red lights, bar fights, bright lights blinding me
Girl I need your touch to set me free

So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I'll turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay, kiss my worries away, far away
I've had one of those days, good for nothing kinda days
Baby I need one of your nights

Girl we've got that kind of romance, one that we'll dance
Without even touching the ground
Remember that night on your street I said I'd sweep you off your feet
Well forever is forever and I'm never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna let you down

So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I'll turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay, kiss my worries away, far away
I've had one of those days, good for nothing kinda days
Baby I need one of your nights

I've had one of those days, good for nothing kinda days
