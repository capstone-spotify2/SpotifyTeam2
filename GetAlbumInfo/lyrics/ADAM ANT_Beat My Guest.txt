Well tie me up and hit me with a stick
Beat me beat me
Yeah, use a truncheon or a household brick
Beat me beat me
There's so much happiness behind these tears
Beat me beat me
I pray you'll beat me
For ten thousand years
Beat me beat me

I'm black and blue baby
I love you
Be your dog
For just one flog
You don't hear me plead
For you to make me bleed
Beat me beat me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Well use a truncheon or a cricket bat
Beat me beat me
A good beatings really where its at
Beat me beat me
