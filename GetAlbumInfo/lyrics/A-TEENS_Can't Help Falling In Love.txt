(I just can't help falling in love with you)

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I say would it be a sin
(Be a sin)
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows (Oooh)
To the sea (Oooh)
So it goes
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Take my hand (take my hand)
Take my whole life too (life too)
For I can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I, I can't, I can't help Falling in love (falling in love) With you (with you)

Like a river flows (Oooh)
To the sea (Oooh)
So it goes
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>

Like a river flows
That's the way it goes
I just can't help fallin' in love with you
(Fallin' in love with you)
Like a river flows (yea yea)
That's the way it goes(cause I can't)
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows (I just can't help myself)
That's the way it goes
I can't help falling in love with you
(I can't help falling in love with you) <i>[x2]</i>

Fallin'in love with you
