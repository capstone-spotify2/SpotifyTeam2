I got up early and the sun was by my side
I thought you was my friend
But all you did was lie
And now I carry this until the day I die
I keep on riding till the sun goes from the sky
Sometimes you get the bear and
Sometimes the bear gets you
I know it's the only fight you've got
Look what it's done to you
I carry this .357 in my hand
Don't ask me why
If you don't want to understand
I keep on moving I keep driving through this land
And by the moonlight will travel if I can
It's gonna take nerve
It's gonna take real nerve
It's gonna take more than you ever ever ever
Thought it could
Very Long Ride it's a Very Long Ride
Very Long Ride it's a
Long Ride
I travel light cos I am the lone rider
I travel light cos I am the outsider
I travel light cos I'm a very good fighter
I travel light all through the day
And through the night
It's gonna take more than reaction
Much more than a brave attempt
You're gonna need skin like a Rhino
To face such cold contempt
I drive in style I drive a '99 beamer
And you just wait until the time that I see ya
You better look again before you look away
I will be driving by the Kings Highway
It's gonna take nerve
It's gonna take real nerve
It's gonna take more than you ever ever ever
Thought it could
Very Long Ride it's a Very Long Ride
Very Long Ride it's a
Long Ride
Very very
Demy-semy-quaverous
Very Long Ride
Very very
Demy-semy-quaverous
Very Long Ride
I keep on moving now until I reach the end
But I'm not moving cos I'm looking for revenge
And I'm not moving cos a friend of mine crossed me
I'll just keep on until I get you the fuck off me
It's gonna take nerve
It's gonna take real nerve
It's gonna take more than you ever ever ever
Thought it could
Very Long Ride it's a Very Long Ride
Very Long Ride it's a
Long Ride
