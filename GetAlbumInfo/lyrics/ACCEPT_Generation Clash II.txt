Warnings surround you
That life ain't long
Same old stories
You've heard 'em before

They tell you to listen
To be like they've been
You carry a burden
Whatever you do

They never approve of
The things that you do
Revolution
In the heart of your home

But what do they do
To comfort you
At times when you don't feel alright

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go

Bitching forever
For wasting time
You better not worry
You're doing alright
They tell you to listen
To be like they've been

But what do they do
To comfort you
At times when you don't feel alright

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash -
kiss those times goodbye
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash -
kiss those times goodbye 
the times are gone for good
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go

Generation Clash - oh it's the
generation Clash
Generation Clash - nothing ventured
nothing gained - so get alive
Generation Clash ...
