Well you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doin' one night stands
And you wanna see me do my thing
All you gotta do is plug me into high

I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

Well you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And You ask me what I'm all about
Come on let me hear you shout high

I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll

I said high, I get high, aaaah!
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

Stars, bulbs....
Spotlight, put the lights out, turn me on
(High voltage rock 'n' roll)
(High voltage rock 'n' roll)

Wine, women and song
(High voltage, high voltage)
Plugged in and turned on.....
