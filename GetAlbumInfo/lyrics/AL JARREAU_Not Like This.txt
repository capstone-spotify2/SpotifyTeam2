Not like this without a single tear
We can't just walk away as if
it never happened

Our kind of love has never
talked in whispers
So if it's time to go,
let's do it right and go out loud

But not like this without
a backward glance
Did all our feeling die
the moment love was over
Well, not in me 'cause
I still feel you in my soul

So I will leave you
tenderly or bitterly
But not like this
