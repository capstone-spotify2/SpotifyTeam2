It was a night meeting
Somewhere in a troubled land
They came with no greeting
Left without a shaken hand.

Nearby the town sleeping
Was unaware of what was done
No need for watchkeeping
They'll be gone before the sun.

You may not see just where the sense is
In the actions of the State
You may not know the consequences
Of their actions till too late
The rival factions still debate
As shadows gather at your gate.

It was a night meeting
They won't admit on either side
There'll be no press briefing
Information classified.

It was a night meeting
Independently arranged
To get a signed treaty
Force the government to change.

Secret diplomacy
Without the means to make their policy prevail
Meanwhile the powers that be
Behind the scenes have guaranteed to see them fail.

You seem beyond the jurisdiction
Of the democratic powers
You do not see the contradiction
Of the watchmen in the towers
You turn your back as night devours
The final chance, the final hours.

It was a night meeting
These are men who won't be missed
Their lives were just fleeting
They don't officially exist.
