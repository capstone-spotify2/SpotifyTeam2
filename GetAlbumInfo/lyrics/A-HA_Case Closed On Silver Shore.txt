Here's a stain on the ottoman 
Here's a slug in the plaster wall 
Here's a glass with a fingerprint 
Left out in the entrance hall 
Left out in the hallway 

Case closed on silver shore 
Can't prove a thing 
Case closed on silver shore 
Can't prove a thing 

Here's a room showing signs of struggle 
Here's a tear in the victim's shirt 
Here's a plate with a chalky substance 
Like a footprint in the dirt 
Left out in on the driveway 

Case closed on silver shore 
Can't prove a thing 
Case closed on silver shore 
Can't prove a thing 

I wouldn't put it past the neighbor 
I wouldn't put it past the maid 
I wouldn't put it past the boyfriend 
Yeah he'd do it in a jealous rage 

Case closed on silver shore 
Can't prove a thing 
Case closed on silver shore 
The boyfriend wonât sing 

Case closed on silver shore 
Can't make it stick 
Case closed on silver shore 
He's getting off quick 

Case closed on silver shore 
On silver shore 
Can't make it stick 

Case closed on silver shore 
On silver shore 
He's getting off quick
