It's been a real long day, 
It's hard to smile, 
You always liked to be alone, 
You didn't have to be alone, 
So much I would say if we had more time, 
I was afraid that you would go, 
I always felt it in my bones, 

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to live a life so numb, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone,

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to throw your life away, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone, 

As you drift away into the light, 
Close your eyes and dream of hope, 
I love you more than you can know, 

We all make mistakes in our lives, 
You gotta learn to be strong, 
Then you can always prove 'em wrong, 

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to live a life so numb, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone,

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to throw your life away, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone, 

Close your eyes and dream of hope, 
You don't have to be alone, 
Close your eyes and dream of hope, 
You always liked to be alone, 

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to live a life so numb, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone,

And when they tell you that the good die young, 
Do they tell you where the good die from?, 
You don't have to throw your life away, 
Now he's gone, 
She's gone, 

She's gone, 
He's gone, 
She's gone, 
He's gone.
