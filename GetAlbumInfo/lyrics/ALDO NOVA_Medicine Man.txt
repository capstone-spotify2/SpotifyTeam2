When the sun goes down and the full moon shines
And all the stars paint pictures 'cross the summer sky
As the clock sweats midnight hits the carnival ground
Like a black cat she walks in without a sound and says

"I'll pay you, handsome, if you read my mind
I can't afford a king's ransom but I'll make it worth your while"

Say you believe and I'll do what I can
I am the medicine man
I see the future in the palm of your hand
I am the medicine man

When the spirits tell me that the time is right
I will read your cards and they will read your life
I draw a hangman, and a joker, and a blushing queen
I know that one is you, but which one is me

Baby I'm the thunder in the pouring rain
I'm the spell you're under, don't forget my name

Say you believe and I'll do what I can
I am the medicine man
I see the future in the palm of my hand
I am the medicine man

Before I wake you from your spell
I'll kiss you once and wish you well
From now until the end of time
You will be, you will be, you will be mine

Say you believe and I'll do what I can
I am the medicine man
I see the future in the palm of my hand
I am the medicine man

Say you believe and I'll do what I can
I am the medicine man
I see the future in the palm of my hand
I am the medicine, I am the medicine
I am your medicine, I am your medicine man
