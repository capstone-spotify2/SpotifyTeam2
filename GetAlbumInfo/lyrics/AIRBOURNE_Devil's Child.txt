I never had a chance at a normal life 
Coz at glance I'm trouble and strife 
So don't patronize or sympathize 
Coz what you say is twisted lies 

I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I've never seen the light 
I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 

With no future for me in this society 
I walk these streets endlessly 
Getting arrested and getting locked up 
I'm the underdog but I won't give up 

I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I've never seen the light 
I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I do what I like 

With no future for me in this society 
I walk these streets endlessly 
Getting arrested and getting locked up 
I'm the underdog but I won't give up 

I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I've never seen the light 
I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I do what I like 
I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I've never seen the light 
I'm the devil's child 
Devil's Child 
I'm the devil's child 
I'm runnin' wild 
Devil's child and I do what I like
