First when there's nothing 
But a slow glowing dream 
That your fear seems to hide 
Deep inside your mind 

All alone I have cried 
Silent tears full of pride 
In a world made of steel 
Made of stone 

Well, I hear the music 
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm 
Wrap around, take a hold 
Of my heart 

What a feeling 
Bein's believin' 
I can have it all 
Now I'm dancing for my life 
Take your passion 
And make it happen 
Pictures come alive 
You can dance right through your life 

Now I hear the music 
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm 
In a flash it takes hold 
Of my heart 

What a feeling 
Bein's believin' 
I can have it all 
Now I'm dancing for my life 
Take your passion 
And make it happen 
Pictures come alive 
You can dance right through your life 

What a feeling 
What a feeling (I am music now) 
Bein's believin' (I am rhythm now) 
Pictures come alive 
You can dance right through your life 

What a feeling (You can really have it all) 
What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call) 
I can have it all (I can really have it all) 
Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call) 
What a feeling
