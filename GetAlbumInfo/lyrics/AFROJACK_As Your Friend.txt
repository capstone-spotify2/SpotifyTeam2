<i>[Chris Brown]</i>
I just canât live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Donât ask me why coz there are too many things
And now weâre standing on the edge
Looking like, "here we go again"
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend...

<i>[Hook]</i>
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

<i>[Beat break]</i>

Oh lilâ mama, I can feel your fire
You poisonous lady, let me take you higher
And I donât care if itâs a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight
And now weâre standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend

<i>[Beat break]</i>

I came to party hoping that you would fall in love
Donât mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loving madly
And the DJ, heâs getting drunk
Trying to get next to you

And now weâre standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend

<i>[Hook]</i>
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as a friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

<i>[Beat break]</i>

And now weâre standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend
