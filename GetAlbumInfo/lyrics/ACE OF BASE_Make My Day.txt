A do do do do-wah
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day
A do do do do-wah
A reason not to see you
A do do do do-wah

He wakes up in the morning with a smile upon his face
He's a fortnight Casanova with no lasting grace
Watcha gonna do about your brother?
He's a hopeless case
Tell me something I don't know

A do do do do-wah
I've been back long before you
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day
A do do do do-wah
A reason not to see you
A do do do do-wah
A do do do do-wah

Now the party's over, you might lose a date
An anti workaholic - I'll give you that
So they're gonna see us on all others
Do it all you can
Just to be some promised man

A do do do do-wah
I've been back long before you
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day
A do do do do-wah
A reason not to see you
A do do do do-wah
Hey, yeah yeah make my day

You wait for the night to come
Just wait for tonight
You wait for the night to come
Just wait for tonight

A do do do do-wah
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day
A do do do do-wah
A do do do do-wah
A do do do do-wah
I've been back long before you
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day
A do do do do-wah
A reason not to see you
A do do do do-wah
Hey, make my day

You wait for the night to come
Just wait for tonight
You wait for the night to come
Just wait for tonight
You wait for the night to come
Just wait for tonight...
