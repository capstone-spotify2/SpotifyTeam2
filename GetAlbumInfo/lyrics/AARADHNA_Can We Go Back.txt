Remember the days when we used to chill
We didn't have a care in the world
We used to laugh together
Blaze it up and walk 'round the creek

Reminiscing on the time
When we used to skip class together
I could never forget ooooh
Never forget my good friends

Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play

He-e-ey. Oooh.
Take me back, take me back oh yeah
Yeah Oh!

Summertime, weather was hot as hell
I swear it ain't hot like it used to be
Back then the music was fire
Why did I had to go leave and retire?

Reminiscing on the time
When things were much better way back then
I could never forget uh
Never forget the time spent oh oh

Can we go back? I wanna go back
Just for a moment, a moment back in time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young and our hearts would run free
Can we go back? I wanna go back

I heard it's foolish to say
That things were better back in the day
But I swear it ain't the same
You know that I gotta roll with the change

But can we go back?
Just one time
You and I
Can we go back?

Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back just one time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can we?
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young oh oh oh
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can weeeee?

Woaahhhhhhhh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
