Theyâll tell you where youâre going
And how you have to get there

What they wonât tell you
Is that youâre working for pennies a day

And youâll work your life away
So they can live their own
Theyâre at the top
Weâre at the bottom fighting for our homes

Iâm in for the long run
Iâm in for the day
Iâm in for the time, though people say
âAre you going to stay this way?â
Iâm in for the life
That I choose to live
If that makes me so unusual
It makes everyone else look all the same (yeah)

The grass is always greener on the opposite side
By the time you get there, you wish you hadnât half of the time

It seems so illogical that we choose to hurt ourselves
But given the choice, you did what anyone would
Who was fighting for their home

Iâm in for the long run
Iâm in for the day
Iâm in for the time, though people say
âare you going to stay this way?â
Iâm in for the life
That I choose to live
If that makes me so unusual
It makes everyone else look all the same (yeah)

(it makes them look the same)

Well I guess I must be going
Iâve got better things to do
Then sit around all day and hate the world

I guess I should be learning
That wishes donât come true
It takes a lot of work to just pull through

When youâve had enough to make you quit
You just have to keep holding on (holding on)

Iâm in for the long run
Iâm in for the day
Iâm in for the time, though people say
âAre you going to stay this way?â
Iâm in for the life
That I choose to live
If that makes me so unusual
It makes everyone else look all the same (yeah)
