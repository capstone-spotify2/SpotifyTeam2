He said let's steal a car, get outta here
I got money for gas and beer
Let's point this car down a two-lane road
Just follow where the headlights go
She said I'm tired of this town anyway
Days go by but things don't change
If I stay here I know I'll die
Without ever really being alive

Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run

She slept in the dashboard light
He stayed awake and drove all night
Ran his fingers through her hair
On their way to everywhere

Morning came and she called home
From an Idaho gas station phone
She slammed the door sat down and cried
Kissed him hard and just said drive

Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run

Love is a fast train, love is a slow rain
You can't stoop it, no you can't stop it......

Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run
