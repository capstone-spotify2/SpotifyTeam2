(Lee diamond, george davis)

It was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

You've beat me to the girl that I always wanted
You thought you had her brother but you still don't own her because I'm not through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

I know that it's a fact that you sneak behind my back
Smiled in my face and deceived me with your lies, but I'm not through
Oh, there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

But this is the part that you knew nothing of
She confessed to me that she toyed with your love
You were just a game, that she loved to play
You never had her
She took you for a ride

All of her ecstasy that you had
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

You had her brother, you were my guest
You pawned your broken heart just like all the rest
And now you are through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

She took you for a ride
