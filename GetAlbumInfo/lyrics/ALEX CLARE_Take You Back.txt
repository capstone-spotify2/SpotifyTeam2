Take me
Take me
Leave me alone
No one still need me
So why don't we just roam
Take me back
Take me back

You heard what I did way back then
Hurt you, I know, but, girl, I need a friend
I'm so tired of these old cliches,
Sick of looking out my window at these gray-lining days

You know we can leave today

Take you back
I got to
Take you back
I wanna
Take you back
Leave me alone
Who's gonna run deep here
So why don't we just run

Still love the city, I owe it so much
These days I'm lost in the crowd, I feel out of touch
These streets raised me, taught me what's fair
But you and I, girl, we got our future elsewhere

We got people on the Southside of L.A.
Here in Jerusalem the chance will get away
We could land in Brooklyn and then again, no
It's too much like London with its red echo

You know we can leave today

Take you back
I got to
Take you back
I wanna
Take you back
Leave me alone
Who's gonna run deep here
So why don't we just run

Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Take you back
Oh, we're going home
Take you back
Oh, we're going home
Take you back
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
Oh, we're going home
