<i>[Tommy Walter:]</i>
On a distant shore
In the morning undertow
All the ships around awakening
I have not forgotten
Even more determined now
I will wake you up from long sleep

When I am king
I will send out my whole fleet
No island unturned
They will bring you home to me

<i>[Paris Carney:]</i>
In the fabric of a very long enchantment
Will you wake me up from long sleep
You were my reflection
In a world abandoned
I will stitch back up our memories

When I am queen
I will weave your tapestry
On my distant shore
Till you find your way to me
