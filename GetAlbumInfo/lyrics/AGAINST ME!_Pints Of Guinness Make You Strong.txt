Evelyn sits by the elevator doors 
It's been 37 years since James died on St. Patrick's Day in 1964 
But she could not hold it against him 
There were times when there was nothing she could do 
But lie in bed all day beside a picture of them together 
A picture of better days 

And just like James, I'll be drinking Irish tonight 
and the memory of his last work week will be gone forever
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight!
If we're never together 
If I'm never back again 
Well I swear to God that I'll love you forever 
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight!

In all the years that went by she said 
She'd always love him
and from the day that he died
She never loved again

And in his wallet she kept in her nightstand 
an a.a. card and a lock of red hair 
she kept secrets of pride locked so tight in her heart 
it killed a part of her before the rest was gone. 

She said, "If I would have known just how things would have ended up 
I just would have let myself die."

And just like James, I'll be drinking Irish tonight 
and the memory of his last work week will be gone forever 
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight!
If we're never together 
If I'm never back again 
Well I swear to God that I'll love you forever 
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight!
