Growing up in a little town where there's not a lot to do
No matter where you go troubles bound to run into you
There was only one water hole this side of the county line
The boys and me would hang our clothes on the no trespassing sign

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We'd go swimming swinging from the tire in the tree
And we'd go fishing but we never caught anything
There was a chance we might get caught but we always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Well the older the old man got the meaner he seemed to be
I could tell when our eyes met he didn't care to much for me
I remember on friday nights me and my girl would wait up late
When he'd turn off his front porch light we'd hop on over the gate

<i>[Chorus]</i>

We'd go kissing underneath the cottonwood trees
And we'd go wishing on every star that we could see
There was a chance we might get caught but we always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Not long ago I went back home for the labor day weekend
As I walked out of the store old man walker came walking in
He said I used to watch you one by one sneak under my gate
But I'd let ya'll play till your momma's said it was getting late
I'd come out a hollerin' and you boys would scatter and run
If you'd of known I was a teddy bear you wouldn't of had half the fun
I said you ol' son of a gun for all these years I thought you hated me
He said boy if that was true would I have hung a tire swing in the tree

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Hearing y'all laughing it really put a smile on my face
Seeing y'all splashing really brightened up this place
There was a chance you might get caught but you always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's propertypacked my bags and said my good-byes early that sunday evening
I drove down the old man's dirt road just as I was leaving
Out there in that water hole were little boys like I used to be
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Trespassing on old man walker's property
