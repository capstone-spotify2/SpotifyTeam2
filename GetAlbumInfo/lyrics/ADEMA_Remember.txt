I'll make you a promise today that this family I'll never betray. Life sometimes fades away

Night is a promise and I hope that this one never ends. The face of a woman in my love before I was a man I'm breaking sometimes, and I'm honest, in pain we can live till the end you know you're on my mind and I promise that I'll see you someday so for now I will just pray

Can't believe it's over
Life just gets in the way. Life just gets in the way

Your eyes were upon us, there are no words for what that meant, the strains of my mother and not enough days that we spent it was my selfish pride. And you taught us there was no one to blame in the end where our feelings reside, and it covers before that day we set everything straight

Can't believe it's over
Life just gets in the way. Life just gets in the way
I remember the words that you said, hearing them as I sat by your bed.
That our life just gets in the way.

Feeling the same everyday without you, can't seem to find my way
Cold sweats in the night wake me from sleep, thinking you're alright

Life just gets in the way. Life just gets in the way.
I remember the words that you said, hearing them as I sat by your bed.
That our life just gets in the way.

Ohhhh, I'll make you a promise today that this family I'll never betray. Life sometimes fades away:
