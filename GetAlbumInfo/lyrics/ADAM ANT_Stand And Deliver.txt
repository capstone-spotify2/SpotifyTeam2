<i>[Spoken:]</i> Stand and deliver!

I'm the dandy highwayman
Whom you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash
On looking flash
And grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo
And your record collection
The way you look, you'll qualify
For next year's old age pension!

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Hoh!

Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
Hoh!

I'm the dandy highwayman
So sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peekaboo roots
That people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery
When nothing is worth taking?
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff
The big mistake he's making

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Hoh!

Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
Hoh!

And even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

We're the dandy highwaymen
So tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies
Where only showbiz loses
We're the dandy highwaymen
And here's our invitation
Throw your safety overboard
And join our insect nation!

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Hoh!

Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
Hoh!

Even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

Qua qua
Da diddly qua qua
Da diddly qua qua
Da diddly qua qua

Stand and deliver!
Stand and deliver!
Stand and deliver!
