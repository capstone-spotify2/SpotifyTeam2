I'm tired of being afraid
When nothing's gunna change
And it's more than just a stupid fling
Yeah, he's got a hold on me

Singin' why did you do this
Why put me through this
All I wanna do

I'm tired of playin'
You love me, and hate it
All I wanna do is move
All I wanna do is move

Another night with you again, hands shaking tryna move the pen, killing me on you I depend, no matter what I do you always in my head
You took over my life, got me living dreams that keep me up at night, are you even aware of my sacrifice, took away any hope of a normal life, you laugh cause you know I never wanted that, you took over my future to help with my past, is that a deal with the devil, or is that a deal with a God, am I just at war with the odds or am I about to break even, you know that I would lieing to you to say I never think about leaving, somehow I keep on believing, bigger reasons that you keep me breathing, I know there's people who need it, I just hope that it's right that I lead em, I hope you got something bigger planned, cause lately I'm questioning everything, but I know that we came too far to go back, just hope that you don't stab me in the back

Back in my bedroom studio, thought we'd be outta here years ago, working 2 jobs not countin you, you ain't really pulling weight like you said you'd do, you ain't really taking shape like they said you would, you ain't really making moves like we thought you could, but fuck it we work till we on for good, Millie on Millie when I'm talkin views, it ain't like the world hasn't heard what we do, workin these hours just so I can move, get back to the city and back to the crew, back on the grind, I swear I'm losing my mind, I swear I'm losing the time, I swear that I'm over due for the crown, you know I'm working for mine
