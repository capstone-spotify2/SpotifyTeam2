Another year has come and gone
As my love for you keeps on and on and on
You're perfect to me
No matter what others see,
You're everything that's on my mind

If I could love you
One hundred years or more
You're everything that I love so, Hey...
My devotion to you,
More than you can stand... Mmmm
And I believe in lovin' the whole woman

Listen here,
You know I love you
Oh how I love you
You're all that's on my mind
Listen here,
But oh how I adore you,
I'd go the last mile for you
You're ever changing times

You're perfect to me
More than my eyes can see, Oh yah...
You know something you're the only thing that's on my mind
As long as I live,
I'll have love to give
I don't want you to forget that now
I'll always be 'round, I'll always be around close around here, Hey...

You're perfect to me
I don't care what anybody else sees... Oh no
You're the only thing that's on my mind
Hey, hey, hey, ha...
I love you baby
I walk the floor at night
Holding my arms tight
But they don't feel better than you
I don't feel no better than you
I love you baby... Yeah
I don't like to fuss and fight, hey...
All I got to say, All I got to say, All I got to see
I love you baby... Yeah
