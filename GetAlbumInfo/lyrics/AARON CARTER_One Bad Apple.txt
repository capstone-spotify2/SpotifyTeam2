I can tell that you've been hurt 
By that look on your face girl 
Some guy brought safety to your happy world 
You need love but you're afraid that if you give in 
Some one else will come along 
And sock it to you again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I could make you happy baby and satisfy you too 
But how can I when you won't give me a chance to prove my love to you 
Won't you give me just one little chance 
I give you my guarantee that you won't be hurt again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I've been noticing you baby for long, long time 
I'm not ashamed to tell the world that you really messed up my mind 
Girl, to me you're like a dream come true 
I would rather hurt myself then to ever hurt you 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard.
