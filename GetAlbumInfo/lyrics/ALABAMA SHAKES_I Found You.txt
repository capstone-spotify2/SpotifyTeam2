This isn't sometimes
Yeah, it's for always
If I'm gonna love you with all of my heart
And if there is no more time,
This always remains.
Even as the world spins itself apart...

Cause I remember them days I waited so patiently
For God to bring someone who's gonna be good to me
And then he blessed my soul

Well, I traveled a long way
And it took a long time to find you...
But I finally found you...

I remember all them lonely days
I traveled out on my own
Then you brought me everything
Ya made my house a home
If it's not the real deal then I don't know it
Cause it sure does feel, and I think it sure does show

I remember all them days I waited so patiently
Until God brought someone who's gonna be good to me
And he blessed my soul...

But, I traveled a long way
And it sure took a long time...
To find you, yeah... but I sure did find you...

And he blessed my soul...
