The Shadow of Your Smile
The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Your lovely smile

Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Oh, the shadow of your smile
