"Is night shift okay with you?"
"Yes"
"Hey, well you got yourself a job, homie"

Graveyard shift ain't never dead
We go to work when people go to bed
We got a tremendous work overload
The boss don't care about the dress code

So, if your hair's messed up, come on in
Nobody don't care 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm fantasizin' about a six fo'
Broke as hell, moppin' the flo

I don't know but I gots the hunch
(What's that?)
That it's almost time for lunch
Smokin' cigarettes in the parkin' lot
All the homies tellin' lies 'bout the women they got

Nobody gets offended at a racial joke
(Why?)
Everybody's laughin', tryin' to stay woke
(Yeah)
We takin' it easy though times are hard
Pullin' practical jokes on the security guard

And if you come late, the boss won't boot ya
Standin' 'round, talkin' 'bout the future
Don't even trip if you feel tired
Take a little nap, you won't get fired

Drink a little beer , smoke you a spliff
(Beer, spliff)
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
(Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

Party, on the graveyard shift
(Yeah, party)
Party, on the graveyard shift
(Oh yeah, alright now)
(You don't have to slave)
You don't have to slave too hard on the graveyard
(Oh)

Hey, yeah, uh
My name is Joseph Foreman, they call me, 'Fro
('Cuz)
I worked at the neighborhood grocery store
We actin' crazy like a bunch of kids
Playin' frisbee with the trash can lids

When the boss man comes, baby we don't run
He's a fool like us just tryin' to have fun
Graveyard shift is a little bit prouder
Play the radio just a little bit louder

DJ playin' that midnight mix
(Mix)
Dance contest on isle number six
(Six)
Bumpin' that old school too short rhyme
(Uh)
Got the homeboys in a soul train line

If you wanna act crazy, go ahead and be wild
If you wanna rap, go ahead and freestyle
Graveyard shift, you just can't beat it
If you get hungry, grab something and eat it
(Ha,ha)

Drinkin' in the back with my home girl
(Yeah)
The beer's on the house from the corporate world
Act like a fool 'til the break of dawn
Yellin' curse words on the intercom

Drag racin' with the fork lift
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
(You know what I'm sayin'? Ha)

Party on the graveyard shift
(Yeah, everyday)
Party  on the graveyard shift
(Alright, yeah)
(You don't have to slave, oh yeah)
You don't have to slave too hard on the graveyard
(Break it down, fellas)
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

I never would work on daytime
(Daytime)
Graveyard shift is my play time
(Playtime)
Daytime jobs are flaky
(Flaky)
Daytime jobs are shaky like Jello Gelatin
(What? Gelatin)

So, I work graveyard shift like a skeleton
(Yeah)
An afro-classic is what I am
I drive to work without a traffic jam
Everybody on the graveyard is like my brother
Always lookin' out for each other

Speak up fo' ya like I lawyer
If you come late, we'll punch the clock fo' ya
We gots no money but we got pride
If you car break down I'll give you a ride

'Cause the corporate world is oh so cold
To the people at the bottom of the totem pole
Divided we fall, together we stand
What you need? Get it from the Afroman

I'm not a thief but I got the hook up
For the barbecue ribs you wanna cook up
And if you need somebody to get drunk with
Call the homeboys from the graveyard shift
(Dedicated to all the blue collar workers
 Strugglin', strivin', throbbin', thrivin')

Party on the graveyard shift
(If the boss lookin' for me
 I'm in my car asleep, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Party on the graveyard shift
(Hey, so watch my back
 'Cuz tap on the window or something, ha, ha)
You don't have to slave too hard on the graveyard
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Happiness is hard to find
Happiness is a state of mind
It can't be found in fame or wealth
It's found real deep inside yourself

Brothers, stop singin' the blues
Throw parties and barbecues
Don't destroy your life, enjoy your life
Play with your kids and make love to your wife

Drink a little beer, don't smoke no crack
Have a good time before Christ comes back
Keep your head high, keep your back stiff
I'll see you Sunday night for the graveyard shift

Party on the graveyard shift
Party on the graveyard shift
You don't have to slave too hard on the graveyard
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

(Hey, check this out loco)
No dental plan,  no Medicare
(Graveyard, graveyard)
Said no vacation, the man don't care
(Graveyard, graveyard)
Ain't got no union  no respect
(Graveyard, graveyard)

Dirty uniforms  and a short paycheck
(Graveyard, graveyard)
Workin' minimum wage everyday
(Graveyard, graveyard)
We gotta get over  some kinda way
(Come on man)
