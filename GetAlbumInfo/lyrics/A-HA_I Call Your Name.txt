We got married on a cold mid-winter's morning
We said our lines
Then kissed
And it was over

Those pronouncements had such weight
I guess they made us hesitate
Hesitate

When she moved her hips
And swayed in my direction
I thought we could make it yet
And beat the isolation

But in that gentle dark
Man, we tore ourselves apart

Through fire and rain
Through wilderness and pain
Through the losses, through the gains
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name

...We used to laugh
Is the fire dying, babe
It hurts to ask

Let me hold you for awhile.
