<i>[Intro:]</i>
This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy as much as I do
Are we ready? I am, because it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Soulo ho, the one and only
You niggas know me, your bitches want me
Determination, I got a grip, 9-5 locs I am not a Crip
Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers
Your short term tall tales won't sell here
And Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here
Let me get a 'hell yeah'

Open your eyes
You niggas know what it is
It's about that time
Soulo ho?
You niggas know what it is
It's been a hell of a ride
You niggas know what it is
We live one hell of a life
So Soulo ho?

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Manipulating minds, reciprocating times
Split on my
Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon
We can see you half-stepping, I should somersault
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
Cause I really did everything I say I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
The same reason why I'm stressed, the same reason why I'm blessed
I stopped playing, and I started planning
I stopped playing, and I made it happen
We mapped it out, and now the map is ours
Raised my stats off of records, check an almanac
Thank God punchline knew I had a knack
Down two die to get my point across like craps
Control System, cut off your radios, cut off your television
