We're living in a different reality
We're toeing the same line
We give in we call it neutrality,
A joke with no punchline
The silver plated hero
Meets the golden hearted whore
The odds'll give you zero,
She'll be leaving in a few days more
Movin' on forever, maybe she don't care
Holding on together, maybe it just ain't there

You're dancing on a high wire
You need to be so sure
There used to be a lifeline
There isn't anymore

We are the same with no similarity,
We talk at the same time
We believe in freedom and charity
As long as I get mine
The ivory madonna is walking
Through the door
You watch her from a window,
It doesn't matter anymore
Moving on forever, maybe she don't care
Holding on together, maybe it just ain't there

You're dancing on a high wire
You need to be so sure
There used to be a lifeline
There isn't anymore
