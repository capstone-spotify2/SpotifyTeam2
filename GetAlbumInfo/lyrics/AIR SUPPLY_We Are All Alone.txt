We are all alone that's the way it seems to be
Love is in my sight and I can see it if you can
Where do we come from, I've been waiting for so long
We are all alone, say you will.
The lights have all gone home and are safely tucked away
There's nothing to come between us but the words we've got to say

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Where do we come from I've been waiting for so long
We are all alone.

And now we are both here are we really within reach
Of the things we need to do c'est a ou c'est la vie

<i>[Chorus]</i>

And now we can both spend all the time that's come our way
I'm not going to let you go for another single day

<i>[Chorus]</i>
