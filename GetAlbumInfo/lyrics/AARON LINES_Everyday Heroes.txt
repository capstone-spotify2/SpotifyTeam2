Jamie's a highschool teacher
She wakes up every morning at the crack of dawn
And puts the coffee on
Gives her lectures, grades those papers
The Work ain't done when the last one's gone
She don't do it for the paycheck
Anything at all would pay the bills
Even on days her life's a train wreck
But she still loves those kids

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you

Joe's a highway worker
I saw him today when I drove by and the sun was hot
100 degrees on that blacktop sweatin'
He's out there working just getting by
He breaks his back to keep his family fed
It's all that matters much to him
Tomorrow morning he'll roll out of bed
Do it all again

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you

There ain't no hall of fame
Probably never know your name
They're everywhere around us
They're stories all the same

So here's to the cop that works the midnight beat
Here's to the maid who cleans the hotel sheets
Here's to the farmer harvestin' the fields
Here's to the trucking haulin' 18 wheels
Here's to the workers on the assembly line
The secretary, the firemen, and the men down in the mines
Here's to everyone who does their part
I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you
