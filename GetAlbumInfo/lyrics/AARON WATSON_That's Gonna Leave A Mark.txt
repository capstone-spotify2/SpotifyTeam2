First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
There in the parking lot of that ol' 7 Eleven
I filled up her truck, I went in to pay
When I walked out she was with him smiling as she drove away

I know that's gonna leave a mark just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern draw
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come running when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark

If you play with fire your bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would have learned
But she's looking so hot so what can I say
My mama said don't but I did it anyway

I know that's gonna leave a mark just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern draw
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come running when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark

Ah tug on them heartstrings

I wish she didn't look so dang good
I wish she wouldn't smile at me that way
There's an exit light shining brighter than the sun
Like a sign from above telling me to run away

I know that's gonna leave a mark just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern draw
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come running when she whispers my name

And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark
