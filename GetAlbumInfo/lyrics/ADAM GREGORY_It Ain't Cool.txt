I used to wonder why the songs on the radio
always seemed to be about love
If you look every book, every TV show
is just full of that stuff

They write about it, talk about it
inside and out
They even cry about it
for crying out loud
Ah, but now that I've got it
I get it now

It ain't cool to sing love songs
but I'm singing one to you
It ain't cool to sing love songs
but I'm giving one to you
And if you laugh at me
that's how it's gonna be
'Cause I'm doin' it
yes it's true
Ah, 'cause now that I've got it
love is cool

The way folks go on and on about it
they're gonna wear the word out
And every time you see a poor fool fall in it
that's all he talks about
I never understood why the subject of love
was the biggest thing around
Ah, but now that I've got it
I get it now

Love is cool
Love is cool baby 
And oh yeah, what's a poor boy
what's a poor boy to do, yeah
