The worst time, to hit you with my first line, no
Everything seemed fine, when I hold you like youâre one-of-a-kind
You said you were a sure sign, itâs feeling like the last time
Play it back, itâs going over and over
Give it up and pull me through, all of this to tell you...

Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far
Canât stop feeling, doesnât matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, Iâll be alright
Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far

If I might say, all of this seems to float away from...
Your lips when theyâre kissing me, and your hips when leaving me for
The last time, Iâm thinking of the first time, ohh
The first time, Iâm thinking of the last time
Play it back, itâs going over and over
Youâre trying me so Iâm moving on, all of this to tell you...

Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far
Canât stop feeling, doesnât matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, Iâll be alright
Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far

This is where we left off and Iâm trying hard to let go
This is where we left off and Iâm still waiting to see if youâll show

The first time, Iâm thinking of the last time
The last time, Iâm thinking of the first time

Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far
Canât stop feeling, doesnât matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye,
You could stay, Iâll be alright
Iâve been thinking, take me now, Iâm in too far
