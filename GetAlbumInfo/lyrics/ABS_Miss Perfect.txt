Abs...

Nodesha...

Shorty, c'mon, uh

Oh my, you was looking so down
When I first met you
I bet you didn't think it would get to a situation when I'd let you,
Just go, so that you let me know,
Why you're acting cold?
Thinking about words that you told me
When you phoned me
She was saying

No, No, No
I'm moving into something new
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
I got a hundred other things to do
Before I go just tell me

<i>[CHORUS 1 - Abs only]</i>
Little Miss Perfect
Was she worth it?
A dangerous game she had to play,
She could've deserted but she flirted,
Now little Miss Perfect's gone away.

<i>[CHORUS 2]</i>
Little Miss Perfect
Was she worth it?
A dangerous game she had to play,
She could've deserted but she flirted,
Now little Miss Perfect's gone away.

Oh no, gonna do it again,
Gonna find myself right back up where I started lady,
Baby girl it ain't hard to tell
That you wanna get your flirt on,
Cos you got your boots and your skirt on, (mm-mmmm)
When you're looking like that,
I think I want you back. (yeah)

No, No, No,
Don't even try to step to me
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
Can't stop this curiosity
Before I go just tell me

<i>[CHORUS 2 x2]</i>

Saying what, you forgot?
Baby stop
You were out at 10 o'clock
On the rocks, getting hot, hot, hot
Is that where you're at?
Got the mack
She's just falling for your chat,
Dirty rat, now you're back, back, back.

No, No, No
I'm moving into something new
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
I got a hundred other things to do
Before I go just tell me

<i>[REPEAT CHORUS 2 TO END]</i>
