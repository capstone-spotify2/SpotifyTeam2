Got them bad bitches on my ding dong
Ask your momma how she get them jeans on?
If it's game time Ima ball full court, feel like Michael Jordan with them rings on
Every superhero need a theme song
Another 100 thou off a ringtone
Shorty eat me like a ice cream cone
Got me beating on my chest like I'm King Kong
Beating on my chest like I'm King Kong
Beating on my chest like I'm King Kong
They just ain't got shit on me
Beating on my chest like I'm King Kong
Got them bad bitches on my ding dong
Ask your momma how she get them jeans on?
If it's game time Ima ball full court, feel like Michael Jordan with them rings on

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Real nigga from the 60
Bullshit you gotta miss me
Hood nigga in Givenchy
Hood nigga in a Bentley
Who dat say they want the pressure? (Who Dat?)
I'm reserving you a stretcher (yeah)
Different cloth and different texture
I'm just on another level
Real nigga neck full of jewels on
Whole clip gone nigga move wrong
Bankroll sitting on sumo
Cutting up in traffic like a motherfucking coupon
Glock flip a nigga like a futon
Y'all niggas scary like a crouton
Riding in that young Jimmy Neutron
I got hoes begging me to suck something
New Margielas when I hop out
My coupe top was a drop out
No diploma, no diploma
Fuck the birthday, Arizona
You owe me money, pay me homie
I need is soon as (Sooners) Oklahoma
Beating on me chest like I'm King Kong
Running up them bands up in Neimans

<i>[Verse 2: Bruno Mali]</i>
Quarter brick, whole brick, half brick
Got a nigga moving like Juiceman
Everybody swear they got the juice now
Pull up on a nigga like Bruce Wayne
Big body taking up two lanes
Chopper get to kicking like Liu Kang
<i>[?]</i> go bye when the pot dawg
We the type to hit your baby mama with the boot game
Shorty want to show me what the ass bout'
But I been a Tity Boi like 2 Chainz
Meanwhile I'm climbing up the food chain
Been B-balling on these niggas no 2k
Same young niggas who started from the bottom now we all up in your mouth no toothpaste
These yellow diamonds no foogazy
Most of these niggas be too fake
23 bags in the stash house
Got another 100 thousand in the suticase
Undercovers on a cool chase
When I pull up something could be the chrome or the shoelace
<i>[?]</i> through the city with top back
Shirt off on em' like 2Pac
Call up big homie El Chapo
Boomin' in The Carter like New Jack
Point me to the Act boi
I'm just tryna put on for the city like Fat Boy
Put the city on the map boy
Me and Ace on a track probably cost a couple racks for it
Gold bottle and the black Porsche
Gotta represent the crib guarantee to bring it back for it
My Mexicano seen in rare form
Got some dope in a rap form and <i>[?]</i> for me to rap for him
