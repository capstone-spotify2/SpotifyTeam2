Sometimes I hear a woman cryin
And a man sayin nothin at all
Often I hear children laughin
And footsteps walkin down the hall
There's a ghost for every memory
Always remindin me that I was wrong
And since her leavin
I've been sleepin
Leavin all of the lights on

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
Haunted by the sounds of broken hearts
Rattlin off the chain of broken vows
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house

There's no place to run and hide
I swear she's everywhere I go
In every room I, smell her perfume,
I know she's not here
But I'm not alone

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
