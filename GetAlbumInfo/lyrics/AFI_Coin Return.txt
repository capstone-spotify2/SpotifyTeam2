I have slipped and I have fallen so far down I can't get out.
Overwhelmed by my doubt.
Things I said I'd never do I've done.
Those I said I'd never be I've become.
I have broken - I'm still breaking - cracked and wrecked, beyond repair.
I can see that no one cares. Forgotten.
Recalled. Smacks me in the face every time I fall.
I cannot disregard, with each new fall I hit twice as hard.
Would you be there for me? I would.
I would be there for you. I would.
Would you look up to see?
I would. falling forward and looking up.
