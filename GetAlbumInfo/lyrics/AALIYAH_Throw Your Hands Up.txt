1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,90 Aaliyah's in the house so check, check it out

The time has finally come to save my beats with the funky hip hop swing
(the funky swing I might add) oh check it
No holding back now is the time, to get busy
So take me to the bridge

I work hard for mine, spending all my time
To give you what you need

So if you down with this funky flavor throw your hands up
And if you got fever for Aaliyah throw your hands up
And if you down with blackground throw your hands up
And if it got soul let me see your hands up
If you got bass in your jeeps throw your hands up
If your not down with the crack throw your hands up
And if you think your hyper enough to swing it throw your hands up
And if your down with the second chapter throw your hands up

Straight from the streets is where I'm coming from (straight out the streets)
With the touch of jazz in me, check it
Take in no shorts when it comes down to shows
I got to wreck it, so take me to the bridge

I work hard for mine spending all my time
To give what you need

Where you at, where you at
So if your down with the PA let me see your hands up
And if your head is bobin to the track throw your hands up
And if you got loot in your pocket throw your hands up
And if you not foul let me see your hands up
And if your protected and you know it throw your hands up
And if R Kelly's record is sharp let me see your hands up
And if your body swing to the track throw your hands up
And if you want some more of the flower throw your hands up

Uh, uh, uh yeah, yeah
Aaliyah bust a free style

This is for the jeeps
Strictly for the jeeps
This is for the jeeps
<i>[Repeat]</i>

So if your down with the funky flower throw your hands up
And if you got the fever for Aaliyah throw your hands up
And if you down with Blackground throw your hands up
And if you got bass in your jeeps throw your hands up
If your not down with the crack throw your hands up
And if you think your hyper enough to swing it throw your hands up
And if your down with the second chapter throw your hands up
So if your down with the PA let me see your hands up
And if your head is bobin to the track throw your hands up
And if you got loot in your pocket throw your hands up
And if you not foul let me see your hands up
And if your protected and you know it throw your hands up
And if R Kelly's record is sharp let me see your hands up
And if your body swing to the track throw your hands up
And if you want some more throw your hands up
