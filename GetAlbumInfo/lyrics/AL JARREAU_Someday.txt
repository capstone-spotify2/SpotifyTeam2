Surely you'll break my heart,
But I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give...
Love's not so easy;
Love can sometimes be just like a cross to bear
Some days it's all right
Sometimes it's so hard to bear
But I still love you
Oh, someday you'll see my point of view
I love...
You...

I know you think I'm crazy,
But I know my mind's not hazy
Knowing how I feel,
Though you don't want me now
I know someday you'll take a look around
Seeing where you've been,
Looking deep within;
You'll find you care for me
Oh, then both our lives will start anew
Someday you'll see my point of view
Then both our lives will start anew...
