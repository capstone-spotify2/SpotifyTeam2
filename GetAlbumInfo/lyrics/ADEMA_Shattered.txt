Do you wake up and wonder where youâre really going
Retry aging in life you wanted to achieve your goals
Now confusion it lingers
Making me feel sick to my stomach
Because who knows what will happen next
I shattered into pieces in this world
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

this world your world my world 
Confusion it lingers a fear of loathing that I regret
Because who knows what will happen next
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

this world your world my world 
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

this world your world my world 
What do you want in life 
Who you have planned for the future I wonder does anything matter
Gives luck on the same old day out and sorrow hold on
To your gold or youâll have nothing

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

youâll have nothing  youâll have nothing  youâll have.... nothing
Why have I shattered into pieces in this world 
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

this world your world my world 
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

This world your world my world 
I shattered into pieces in this world 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

this world your world my world!
