Creeping slowly like a spider on the wall
Rolling heavy like a cannon ball
Crawl beside me, won't you tell me where you've been
Don't let them tell you that it's in your head
I'm the one, I'm your friend, let me in

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Move, you wanna start it up
Move, you gotta roll it up, just one is never enough
Move, are you feeling it
Move, you wanna take a hit, just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down from above

Light me, try me now, the smoke can clear the air
Take it all til there's nothing left
Can't deny me cuz I know you feel the hit
Close your eyes and you're still seeing red
I'm the one, I'm your friend, let me in

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Move, you wanna start it up
Move, you wanna roll it up
Move, you wanna light it up
Just one is never enough

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Just one is never enough
Are you feeling it
You wanna take a hit
Just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down from above
Just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down
