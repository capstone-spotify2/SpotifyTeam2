When the moon shines
On the cow shed
And we're rollin' in the hay
All the cows are out there grazing
And the milk is on its way.

I am a cider drinker
I drinks it all of the day
I am a cider drinker
It soothes all me troubles away
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay.

It's so cozy in the kitchen
With the smell of rabbit stew
When the breeze blows 'cross the farmyard
You can smell the cow sheds too.
(Oh, I've never smelt nothing like it in all my life!)

When those combine wheels stops turning
And a hard day's work is done
There's a pub around the corner
It's the place we have our fun.
(Arr, we'll have some fun 'n' all.)

I am a cider drinker
I drinks it all of the day
I am a cider drinker
It soothes all me troubles away
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay.
(Come on, get a couple of pints down 'ere then!)

Now dear old Mabel
When she's able
We take a stroll down Lover's Lane
And we'll sink a pint of Scrumpy
Then we'll play old nature's game.
(Ha ha ha!
Oo arr!)
But we end up in the duck pond
When the pub is sized to close
With me breeches full o' tadpoles
And the newts between me toes.

I am a cider drinker
I drinks it all of the day
I am a cider drinker
It soothes all me troubles away
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay.
(Come on everyone, get up 'ere then!
Ha ha!)

I am a cider drinker
I drinks it all of the day
I am a cider drinker
It soothes all me troubles away
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay
Oh arr oh arr aay.

Let cider be the spice of life!
