Ha, beast
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know nobody out here fucking with me
Nigga, I'm just tryna blaze
I get that money everyday
Believe me
Believe me
I'm the one who out here killing every beat
I'm just tryna find somebody to compete
I'm a motherfucking beast
Fuck it
I'm going in, talking 25 to life
Only one who kill the beat
And I can bring it back to life (uhh)
Ain't no need to say it twice
I am not the one to play with if you ever need advice
Word
I'm trynna make a million in a month
You still fighting for employee of the month
Everytime I'm on the beat I get a rush
I'm the one who get it done
Michael Jordan in the clutch (woo!)
We got a problem, boy don't make a nigga blush
You the shit then I'm a sewer
Either way I get your flush
Like an iPhone, pussy
I can call and get the touch
Nicki post the topless pictures
Make a pastor wanna cuss
Holy shit, you mothersucker
Ferragamo on the buckle
I'm the one amongst a couple
Boy, don't even make me chuckle
I got money in the duffle
Lot of years into the hustle
'Fo you put my life in jeapordy
You catch a daily double
That'll be 25 rounds, if you play mine
Aye, you's a pussy nigga
Boy, wear your tampon
See, I was out in Anguilla for a vacay
It's going down at the villa nigga, mayday
A hundred grand, that's the estimated week rate
For Pete's sake, that's the lighest weight that we play
I got the presidential rollie set at my time
Do all the hate you niggas dishing come with pom pom's?
I'll fly your lady to whatever state the boy in
And you ain't even gotta ask, just know I'm going in (hoo)
Believe me
Believe me
My new shit gone wake you right up out your sleep
And I ain't trying to find nobody else to be
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast (yeah)
Still at it
I'm a get em
Body bag it
Ain't no secret, automatic
What's the fuss and all the static
Got the lambo doing magic
Dissapearing out in traffic
I'm just adding up the money, boy
That's simple mathematics
I was young without a daddy
Reason why I'm such a savage
If you playing with my people
They gone have to pick your casket
On God, I'm a don
You ain't nothing but a pebble in the pond
Watch the snakes; they approaching on the lawn
Hood nation, they could never break the bond (hey)
I ain't even gotta flex
You don't really want me coming at your neck
I got now and I got next
If I don't answer tell your bitch to send a text, nigga (ha)
And I'm a beat it, nigga
Believe me
Believe me
She gon' travel 'round the world for the D
This is greatness in the making
Boy, I've been a threat
A-Wiggins, nigga, you ain't get to see it yet
Ever want me in your city, better send a check
I don't need a pet you know when you see a vet
Tell the critics go to hell
I'm the one they rooting for like Johnny Manziel
Sorry for the wait, I had to tamper with the scale
Fuck your favorite rapper, that's the word to run and tell (haa)
Ya'll done got me on my old flow
I'm a ride for my niggas and the logo
Know the squad
Hood Nation if you didn't know
<i>[?]</i> 'bout the realist you would ever know (sheesh)

Free Meek
Free my nigga fat boy too
Greatness coming soon, nigga (like that!)
That shit on the way, nigga
Hood Nation we the best, nigga
Belive me
And it don't take for instagram for you to get the picture, nigga
We just warming up with this shit
Believe me
