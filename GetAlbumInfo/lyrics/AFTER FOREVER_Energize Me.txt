Energize me with a simple touch or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame that's burning between us

It's not a fantasy, another mystery
It's just what I can feel, it' something I can see
It's like a memory, an inner melody
It's just what we all know, and we all hear

I was blind, I was closed down
Could not feel or set it free

Energize me with a simple touch or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame that's burning between us

It lies in everyone this whirling energy
It's all around us too, electrifying you
So dare to set it free, this virtue is the key
To something we all know and we all use

I can feel it's inside me
Open up enlighten me!

Energize me with a simple touch or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame that's burning between us
Energize me with a simple smile, open up your mind
Energize me, activate the light that's given and taken

Can you believe in the power that's burning between us?
Would you believe if you open up your mind, open up your heart

Energize me with a simple touch or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame that's burning between us
Energize me with a simple smile, open up your mind
Energize me, fire up this fire that's burning forever
