Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
You can't deny
There's something dark
Against the light
All i can say
It doesn't have to be this way
We'll be chasing our tails madly
See days pass like wildfire
Right from the start
I knew this world would break my 
heart

I dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
Break my heart
And dream myself alive
What can it mean

I'm drawing pictures of the sea
Right from the start
I knew this girl would break my heart

Dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
