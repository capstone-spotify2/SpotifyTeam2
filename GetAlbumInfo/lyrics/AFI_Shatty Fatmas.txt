Don't care to hear what you heard.
I won't believe a single word.
Don't care to hear what you say.
I won't believe it anyway.
You relay fiction, facts you avoid.
You're just like a fucking tabloid,
you can never seem to get your information straight.
Tell me something I don't know.
Your information's fucking faux.
Don't you have somewhere to go?
Your mouth is quick, your mind is slow.
Don't want to know what you know.
I just want you to fucking go.
Don't want to know what you believe.
I just wish that you would leave.
You try to cajz everyday, I wish that you would get away.
You can never seem to get your information straight.
Tell me something I don't know.
Your information's fucking faux.
Don't you have somewhere to go?
Your mouth is quick, your mind is slow.
Go! When you try to hang around,
I'd really like to push you down.
When you try to understand,
I don't really think that you can.
You relay fiction, facts you avoid.
You're just like a fucking tabloid,
you can never seem to get your information straight.
Tell me something I don't know.
Your information's fucking faux.
Don't you have somewhere to go?
Your mouth is quick, your mind is slow.
