Down in the jungle
Feeling very fat
You better hit the floor
and give me twenty
And the girls sing

Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
Do it till you're sore
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
I know what you're looking for

Heaven's where you find it
So sit back and relax
I wouldn't be so sure
'Cos we need plenty
And the girls sing girls sing

Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
Do it till you're sore
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
I know what you're looking for

Rough Stuff when a man's got to do
What a man's got to do
What a man's got to do oh yeah
Rough Stuff when the time is right
And the place you go to whale
Gotta out something down

How far can you get
And still come back alive?
You never hear the shot
The shot that gets you
And the girls sing girls sing
