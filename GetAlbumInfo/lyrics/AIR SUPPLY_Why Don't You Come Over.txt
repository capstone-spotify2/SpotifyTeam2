Don't you worry, pretty baby
Everything's alright
Its another day tomorrow
And another night.
You can tell me how your feeling
Every single word
I was having trouble sleeping
Like the early bird
Who just want's to be heard

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Why don't you come over
I can't stop thinking of you
Why don't you come over
My heart won't rest 'til you do

Pick up the phone
Your clothes from the floor
The sleep in your eyes
And walk through the door

I'll turn on the light

Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over tonight

We can sit down at the table
Let your problems drown
I know how to get you smiling
How to be your clown
There's no need to think about it
Just come as you are
I'll be waiting by the window
For my shining star
You know it's not that far

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Pick up the phone
Your clothes from the floor
The sleep in your eyes
And walk through the door.

I'll turn out the light

Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over tonight.
