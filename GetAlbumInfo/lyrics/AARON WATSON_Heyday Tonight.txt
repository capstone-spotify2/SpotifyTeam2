I said hey sugar mama
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
Well Ive been pushed down kicked around
All over town all week
Burnin both ends from dusk til dawn

Tryin to make ends meet
Tell me why, Lord tell me why
Nice guys end up last in line
Theres only one thing on Gods green earth
To get this cruel world off my mind

I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight

Id say Monday is the worst day

For those workin man blues
And Tuesday and Wednesdays more the same ole bad news
Well Thursdays ok and Fridays gettin brighter
When the whistle blows at 5:00
I'm comin home to pull an all-nighter

Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight

I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So kick off your shoes, forget about your blues
And let your troubles take flight
Well you and me hun well have a little fun
Until the mornin light
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight

I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets make a little love beneath the moon above
In the glow of a kerosene light
Well be turnin on and on til the break of dawn
Til we turn it on just right
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
Im a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
