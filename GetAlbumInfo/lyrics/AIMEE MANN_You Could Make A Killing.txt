There is nothing that competes with habit
And I know it's neither deep nor tragic
Simply that you have to have it

So you can make a killing
So you can make a killing
So you can make a killing

I wish I was both young and stupid
Then I too could have the fun that you did
Till it was time to pony up what you bid

So you can make a killing 
So you can make a killing
So you can make a killing

I could follow you and search the rubble
Stay right here and save myself some trouble
I try to keep myself from seeing double

Or I could make a killing
Or I could make a killing
Or I could make a killing
