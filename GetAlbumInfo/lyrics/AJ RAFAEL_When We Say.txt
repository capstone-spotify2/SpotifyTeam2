Somethin' bout the way
Somethin' bout the way you look in my eyes
You make everything so damn easy
So easy that I don't got to worry about a thing

And baby when we touch
All I can see is the image of us
Sittin' by the ocean, just before the dusk
Sippin' on a juicebox, with sand between our toes

And this is the part when we say we're in love
And the part where we have our first kiss
But this ain't a movie, I know you can't come with me
You got your life, he better be treatin' you right

Just tell me you don't love me
Tell me you don't feel the same way that I do
Tell me I don't make you smile like I do when you walk in the room
You're so... so hard to let go... Oh...

And this is the part when we say we're in love
And the part where we say it's forever
But this ain't a fantasy, I know you can't come with me
You got your life, he better be treatin' you right

This hurts so much
To know that you're with someone else when you should be with me
It's just hard to accept that I can't be around
He better be treatin' you good
I'm no Einstein but I know a sign when I see one
And I know you love me too
And I know you love me too...

And this is the part when we say we're in love
And the part where we have our first kiss
But this ain't a movie, I know you can't come with me
You got your life, he better be treatin' you good... so good...
You got your life, he better be treatin' you...
Treatin' you... treatin' you right...

Treatin' you right...
