Woo woo woo woo woo woo

Sometimes life seems full of complications
Hard to see the forest for the trees
Just a little brave imagination
Opens up new possibilities
So look behind your eyes
You'll be surprised at what you see

Life is full of tricky situations
Don't get caught up in the yesterdays
There's a something called imagination
Even little children find a way
So put your hand in mine
I bet we'll open up the door
If we seek we'll find
Shining star's design
Get out the lamp and bring
Our fantasies to light

We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away
Imagine you and me
A dance in ecstasy
Believe and it shall be
It's the chance that we should take

There's a man I know
South of the border
Who's seen the world
And never left his home
I heard him talkin'
To his only daughter
He said you don't have to fear
The great unknown
Darling in your mind
You've got the best
And that ain't all
If you seek you'll find
Shinning star's design
We got the lamp that brings
Our fantasies to light

We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away
We take what's on or minds
And give it room to shine
And see what we can find
There's so much to celebrate
Imagine you and me
A dance in ecstasy
Believe and it shall be
If we only try imagination

<i>[vocal improvisation - scatting]</i>
Imagination, imagination, imagination
<i>[vocal improvisation - scatting]</i>

If we seek we'll find
A magic star's design
We've got the chance to bring
Our fantasies to light

We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away
We take what's on or minds
And let the secret shine
And see what we can find
There's so much to celebrate
Imagine you and me
A dance in ecstasy
Believe and it shall be
Because there's nothing in the way

We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away....
