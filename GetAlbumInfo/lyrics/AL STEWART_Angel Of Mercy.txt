Every evening
You come around here in your cloak of lies
Half-believing
I sit and listen as you offer up the prize

Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
There is no pleasure waiting here for you
Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
I don't see you any more as an angel of mercy

Imitations
Of the good life were your stock in trade
Pale imitations
You run for cover when the promise starts to fade

Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
There is no treasure waiting here for you
Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
I don't see you any more as an angel of mercy

You play the game well
You've got the knack
Your hand in the till
And the knife in the back
Head for the hills
Leaving them flat
How come you treat
Everybody like that?

Spaced invader
Of my privacy be on your way
Tricky trader
In webs of fantasy, the bank is closed today
Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
There is no pleasure waiting here for you
Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
I don't see you any more as an angel of mercy

Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
There is no treasure waiting here for you
Pick up your smile
Just go faithless friend
I don't see you any more
As an angel of mercy
Oh, an angel of mercy
Oh, an angel of mercy
