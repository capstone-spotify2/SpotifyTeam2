You say you want some fun
You're not the only one
Not the only one

And you say you wanna run
You're not the only one
Not the only one

You will never get over me
I'll never got under you
Whenever our voices speak
It's never our minds that meet

You say you want some
You're not the only one
Not the only one

And you, you say you've come undone
You're not the only one
Not the only one 

You will never get over me
I'll never got under you
Whenever our voices speak
It's never our minds that meet

You'll never get over me
