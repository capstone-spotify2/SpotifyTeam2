Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write me today
I'm goin' away

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write me today
I'm goin' away now

Well, I've been away forever, suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never never never never never get so far behind
I said the ways of the night are evil with eye's that love the day
But I'll never never never never never get so far away, yeah, no

I said write me
Hmm, write me
Hmm, write me, hmm
I said write me
Hmm, write me
Hmm, write me, hmm

Well, there's nothin' I can see that'd ever make
Me want to be without her, she's good, she's good to me
Said there's no way to explain the kind of feeling
That you get out in the rain, she's good, she's good to me
See this emptiness inside, it makes me scream
It make me crawl out of my high, she's good, she's good to me
Oh no no no no no no

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write me today
I'm goin' away

Well, I've been away forever, suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never never never never never get so far behind
Well, I've been so many places, hidin' from the wind and the rain
But you could write me a letter for to save me from a-goin' insane, ha ha 

I said write me
Hmm, write me
Hmm, write me, hmm

I said write me
Hmm, write me
Hmm, don't fight me baby, yeah
