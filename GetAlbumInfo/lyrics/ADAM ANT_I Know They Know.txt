What's the point of a fight to the death
When you fought them all and you beat the rest

Listen such a mountain to show you
Things are not what they seem
Very rarely the things I say 
Are the right things
Are the light things

They know I know they know
They know I know they know

Your heart's on the wrong side
Desillusion creeps in
Very rarely the things I say
Are the right things
Are the light things

They know I know they know
They know I know they know

Now any intention of rejuvination is over
Bringing me into a dinosaur's life can be hard
I am a monster like anyone else if you push me
This fabulous dream is no scheme to be so fully marred

Such a mountain to show you
Things are not what they seem
Very rarely the things I say 
Are the right things
Are the light things

They know I know they know
They know I know they know
