Youâre always on my mind
No matter where we currently reside
Or what your state of

Mind is on the matter of everything
Youâre no good to me if we can not stay

Ourselves through this confusing mess

Our lives might change but hopefully the feelings stay

Iâll take
The road less commonly traveled
My choices seem to interrupt
Our lives and state of

Mind on the matter of everything
Youâre no good to me if we can not stay

Ourselves through this confusing mess
We have to make this last

Would you rather wake up with me or without me?
Think about it and for you Iâll do the same

(oh) weâll be just fine
We only need some time
To think things through

Would you rather wake up with me or without me?
Think about it and for you Iâll do the same
Our lives might change but hopefully the feelings stay

I say
Youâre always on my mind
No matter where we currently reside
Or what your state of

Mind is on the matter of everything
Youâre no good to me if we can not stay the same
