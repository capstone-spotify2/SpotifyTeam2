You really want to freak me out, now dontcha'
Dontcha' turn off the lights
A chill is in the air, I know we're gonna'
Gonna' bump in the night
A shiver down my spine won't keep me from it
Cause I'm here for the scare
A spooky kind of crazy, doesn't cut it
You bitches better beware
Yeah!

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
You're giving me the creeps
You're giving me the creeps
You-you, you-you
Woah-ooh, woah-ooh

A ghost is at the door, I hear him knockin'
And he's knockin' for me
The mummy's out the tomb, and there's no stoppin'
C'mon I'm ready to scream
The zombies in the room are gonna' eat up
Gonna' eat up our brains
No way to run and hide, they're gonna' find us
Let's give em' all they can take
Yeah!

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

<i>[Post-Chorus x2:]</i>
Creeps, creeps
Creeps, creeps
You're giving me the creeps
You're giving me the creeps

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
And Dracula goes, "I vant to suck your blood"
And the witch goes, "Yak-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka!"
And the zombie goes, "Ehhhh-uhhhhh"
And the mummy goes, and the mummy goes...
I don't know what the hell a mummy sounds like!
Huh-ha-ha-ha-ha sorry!

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
