Do you feel your future set in stone?
Do you fear the thought of the unknown?
Here's to the nights that'll change your whole life
Here's to the times we'll go and give them hell

If you believe in something
Might as we'll be you
When you go off at nothing
Hidden with the truth

Cause one day you'll wake up
And see in you
A different kind of animal
With nothing left to lose
One day you'll wake up
What else could I do?
One day you'll wake up

Are you where you've always wanted to be?
Do you take advantage of your vanity?
Here's to the nights that'll change your whole life
Here's to the times we'll go and give them hell

If you believe in something
Might as well be you
When you go off at nothing 
Hidden with the truth

Cause one day you'll wake up
And see in you
A different kind of animal
With nothing left to learn

Wherever you are, wherever you go
I'll past the test, I'll let you know
That you know all that I've done
Why can't you all just let me be?
Take the chance and set me free
Tell me all the things that I've done
(I really should've done)

If you believe in something
Might as we'll be you
When you go off at nothing
Hidden with the truth

Cause one day you'll wake up
And see in you
A different kind of animal
With nothing left to lose
Cause one day you'll wake up
With nothing left to lose
One day you'll wake up
One day you'll wake up
