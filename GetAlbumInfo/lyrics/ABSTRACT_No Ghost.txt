Now there's no ghost
No ghost to hold us down
Now that we both
We both, have let go now
So glad we can still love
In our hometown
Now there's no ghost
No ghost to hold us down

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
No ghosts inside these lives we've made
We both have our past and lie in beds we make
We both found our suns, the warmth we gain from love
But what we had ain't lost, no we don't hold no grudge
Learned a lot bout ourselves
While we got to knowin' each other
We're chapter inside of stories
Now we both writin' another
Lucky to have known us
Memories to bring up
Some may just be too much
But we'll embrace what was

You got a new man and I know he good (know he good)
I know because you always know what's good (cause you always know what's good)
I got a new girl and she everything (everything)
And I'm just happy we both happy after everything, yeah

No weight on my heart
It got me feeling brand new
Messed with the idea of us
I'm finally ready for you
I had to center myself
Before I found someone else
Prove I was good on my own
'Fore I could bring you along

Lost inside the fire in your eyes
You got a glow that's lighting up the night
You got me knowing I could do it all
And you'll be here to catch me if I fall

I got a new girl and I know she good (know she good)
You know because I always know what's good (cause I always know what's good)
You got a new man, hope he everything (everything)
And I'm just happy we both happy after everything, yeah
