When I needed you 
To be my girl 
When I needed you 
To give me a world 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When I wanted all you had 
And what you gave me turned out all bad 
I needed all your love 

When I wanted you all for my own 
When I wanted you 
But you just left me alone 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
<i>[Chorus]</i>

I needed all your love 
<i>[Repeat]</i>
