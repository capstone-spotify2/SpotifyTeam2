The eyes, looking so cold
Condemn failure and seek
for perfection what will never be attained

They're judging the denying face which stares back, 
a bewildered revelation

Show me objectivity
And let these eyes judge again

You cannot touch what you can't ever obtain
I'm inexhaustible as well as empty, 
in my bitter search

My words are yours, 
my voice speaks for your thoughts
I am your mirror without remorse, 
your reflection without doubts

I fall and fall, 
I must learn from the bruises, 
the scars will be my guide

There's no excuse in ignorance
No time for weakness or regret
Face your mirror without doubt, 
your reflection without remorse

If knowledge was wisdom, 
and wisdom the key to inner rest, 
teach me...
