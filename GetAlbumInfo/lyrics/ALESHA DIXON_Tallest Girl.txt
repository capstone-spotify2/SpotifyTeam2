Skyscrapers don't mean a lot
The way you elevate and turn me up
You push me up to the highest spot
All you got don't never stop

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Really rushing inside my veins
Those deep foundations you're building under
Putting rocks inside of me

The way you lift me up I feel so high
The way you lift me I can touch the sky
Put me right on top the world
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah

You can't think just chemistry
It's real love with you and me
Going up in a fantasy
Cruising up 30 thousand feet

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Really rushing inside my veins
Those deep foundations you're building under
Putting rocks inside of me

The way you lift me up I feel so high
The way you lift me I can touch the sky
Put me right on top the world
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Feel you rushing inside my veins
Those deep foundations you're building under
Make me feel like the tallest girl
Feel like the tallest girl
Tallest girl, tallest girl
Tallest girl, tallest girl

The way you lift me up I feel so high
The way you lift me I can touch the sky
Put me right on top the world
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl, yeah
