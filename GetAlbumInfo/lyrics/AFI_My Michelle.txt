<i>[Originally by Guns N' Roses]</i>

Your daddy works in porno 
Now that mommy's not around 
She used to love her heroin 
But now she's underground 
So you stay out late at night 
And you do your coke for free 
Drivin' your friends crazy 
With your life's insanity 

Well, well, well you just can't tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 

Sowin' all your wild oats 
In another's luxuries 
Yesterday was Tuesday 
Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
But school starts much too early 
And this hotel wasn't free 
So party till your connection call 
Baby I'll return the key 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>

Well, well, well you just can't tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
Well, well, well you never can tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 

Everyone needs love 
You know that it's true 
Someday you'll find someone 
That'll fall in love with you 
But oh the time it takes 
When you're all alone 
Someday you'll find someone 
That you can call your own 
But till then ya better... 

Now you're clean 
And so discreet 
I won't say a word 
But most of all this song is true 
Case you haven't heard 
So c'mon and stop your whinin' 
'Cause we both know money burns 
Honey don't stop tryin; 
An you'll get what you deserve 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
