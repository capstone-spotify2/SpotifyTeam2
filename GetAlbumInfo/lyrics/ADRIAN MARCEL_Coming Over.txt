Coming over, coming over
Coming over
Coming over, coming over

We've been texting too much
Talking too long
I can't deny what I'm feeling
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now

Baby it's 2 am
Your roommate ain't home
Just got off work 
but you waited
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now

We gonna talk 
I'm on my way
I just gotta get to know the real you
Better back up every word you said
Let's be face to face so I can feel you

Got me running all of these lights
girl you're fucking my head up
you keep talking that shit
We'll be fucking the bed up
We ain't got to take it there a tonight
Cause I ain't nothing like them other niggaz

We've been texting too much
Talking too long
I can't deny what I'm feeling
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now

Baby it's 2 am
Your roommate ain't home
Just got off work 
But you waited
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now

Ooh if we're more than that its worth holding back   
Holding back
You know if you really want it baby
I'll be there
give you that

Got me running all of these lights
girl you're fucking my head up
you keep talking that shit
We'll be fucking the bed up
We can do anything you like
Anything you like
If you wanna lay there 
While I play in your hair 
Kiss you from here to there

We've been texting too much
Talking too long
I can't deny what I'm feeling
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now

Baby it's 2 am
Your roommate ain't home
Just got off work 
But you waited
So I'm coming over
I'm coming over now
