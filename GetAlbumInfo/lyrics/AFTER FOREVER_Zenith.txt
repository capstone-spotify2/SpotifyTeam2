Is there something you feel?
Is there something you furtively know? 
Under the spell of science, 
Can we declare? 

Can we allow ourselves to experience? 
Can we be open-minded enough? 
Won't we fear what we cannot defy? 
Do we need to declare? 
Break the force of habit! 

Why can't you see? 
Fear will impede you to break through your trivial life
And find the missing aim to evolve

Is this the frontier, our zenith? 

Can we be receptive to our ignorance? 
Will or won't we be able to reveal? 
Dulled senses and the need for proven theories
Has masked our natural insight in life
And mysteries

Life is discussed and measurable
Every aberration is observed with agony and suspicion
Until it is declared again
