Well I've seen the sunset from the top of a mountain
And I've walked the streets of Katmandu
I've seen a sky so full of stars, I couldn't count them
But I ain't never seen nothing like you

I've felt forgiveness looking out over the ocean
I've been lonely in a cheap motel
I've felt love as gently brush against my skin
But I've never felt nothing like you

<i>[Chorus]</i>
You, you're too beautiful for words
You, you move me so much it hurts
Never had something I was so afraid to lose
I never had nothing like you

Well I would give away all of my tomorrows
Let my soul turn black and blue
Just to spend one night lost in your arms
Cause I ain't never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you
