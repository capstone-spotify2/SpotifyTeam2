I might seem a bit peculiar
A bit not right
for though I try, I remain a stranger - not of this time.

I swear I'm almost there
though I've been wandering for days.
I may be chasing ghost trains hoping they'll arrive
where we used to play.
I may be hopping ghost trains for they terminate
where we used to play in those days.

I know I'm with strangers I recognize and I realize my own disowned me. Were never mind.

I swear I'm almost there.

This is right where we used to play.

I may be chasing ghost trains hoping they'll arrive
where we used to play.
I may be hopping ghost trains for they terminate
where we used to play in those days.

I never will let it go until I find the place I called mine.
I never was truly meant for this time.
