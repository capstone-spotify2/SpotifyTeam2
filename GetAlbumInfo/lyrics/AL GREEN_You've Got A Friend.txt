When you're down an' troubled
You need some love an' care
An' nothin', nothin' is goin' right

Close your eyes an' think of me
An' soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
An' you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin'
I wanna see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark an' full of clouds
An' that ol' North Wind
That ol' North Wind begins to blow

You just keep your head together
An' call my name out loud, yes
An' soon, very soon you'll hear me
Knockin' on your door, yeah, I will

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've gotta do is call
An' I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
'Coz people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Hell, they'll take your soul if you let them
No, don't you let them, no

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call me

And I'll be there, yes, I will, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
