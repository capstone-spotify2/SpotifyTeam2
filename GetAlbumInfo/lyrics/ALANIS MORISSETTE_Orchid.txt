Me, and my helmet such an un-conventional kid 
All intense and kinetic, at best tolerated from afar 
Not yet arrested, and by that I mean betrothed 
though a start I am newly courted 
I've just not been trusted with alters 

I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned yet disturbed 
wrongly label-ed and under-fed, treated like a rose as an orchid 

My friends, as they weigh in, get understandably protective 
They have a hard time being objective 
So inside we cancel each other out 

I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned and unloved 
unlabeled and misunderstood, treated like a rose as an orchid 

You've brought water to me, making sure my bloom rebounds 
you know best of what my special care allows 

So I've lived in my blind spot 
thought myself usual when I'm not 
and your garden is a nice spot 
as long as it is brave and where you are 

For this sweet piece of work, high maintenance and deserted 
I've been different and deserving, treated like a rose as an orchid 
Sweet piece of work, overwhelmed un-observed 
I've been bowed down to but so misread 
treated like a rose as an orchid
