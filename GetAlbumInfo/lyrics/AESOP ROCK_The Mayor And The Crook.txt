No more pencils no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now let's build

Every tenderfoot cadet better they be slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a plastic catalogue
And where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set em' free and let em' feed
The devil tree penciled me in but I slept thick through my alarm sock
Slick Willy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating man to the high ride, base tied
Face mine's and make God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Cut into 5-digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destinies resting with red worms chewin" off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the f-5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If I botched the operation I apologize (sorry)
The air's rooted in carbon
I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
I'm fresh out of Geppeddo's woodwork asylum
Cedar frame, wire-bound knuckles
Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle
Well when a page becomes a squire, re-engage, clap your wings
When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (glory hunter)
Is it genuine enough to feel baby felon
Negotiate comradery of wills
Hows this my little loom
Perv surgeon with dirty dominion monitor boxes
Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins
Now y'all ain't excused from table side
Till the dinner plates fly
Slurping' liquid happy citzen enhancer
I got this slicky sycamore head shaker
Mimic stitch and splinter entry
Thereby filtering citizens hit-man prior to acts descending (tight)
Cats know the ambiance calm beyond comparison
Captive, passive spring loaded serenity
I'm trying to give this city acupuncture
Shovin one-way pins in subway systems
Stand up where I'm layin, now that a runway vic (push)
Made you go batty, spreading spawn legitimate
Spice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems
So one overlooked the scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
Then rock like medusa glances
You ran the final mile before the blanks blow
Home alone sippin beetle juice
Just to numb and then shimmy the needles loose
I built a castle out of fifty-two cards
Plus jokers with an image
Modern theory jars us while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm mad at how far this is dishonoring Occam's Razor
But it seemed so being fatigued knuckle work (labor)
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located the matrix then impedes
