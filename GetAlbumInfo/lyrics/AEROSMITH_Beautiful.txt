A friend of mine was talkin'
I was ear jacking, eaves dropping
Down on my knees
So I could hear what she was sayin'
As I got closer
To her fire, her desire
Was to lead me on and on and on
And it was like

Be beautiful!
We're free again, we're outta here
Be beautiful!
You be my friend
Let's disappear

Now I got to thinking
Bout the high speed dirty deed
It's what I want, what you need
I think you best believe it
Call it what you will
But you still gotta know
We can skin it, we can sit it
Yeah, so baby let's begin it
Saying

Be beautiful!
We're free again, we're outta here
Be beautiful!
You be my friend, let's disappear
Be beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried
Be beautiful!
Just spread your wings and let it fly

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

Beautiful!
We're free again, we're outta here
Beautiful!
You, me, my friend, let's disappear
Beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried
Beautiful!
Just spread your wings and let it fly

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
