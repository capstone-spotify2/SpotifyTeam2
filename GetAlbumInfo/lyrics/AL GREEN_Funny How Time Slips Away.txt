Well hello there
My, it's been a long time
How am I doin'
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems like
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
You're gonna love him till the end of time
I remember that's the same thing
That you told me yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
Well, I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
Remember what I told you
That in time you're gonna pay

Well ain't it funny how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
