Ok, my city on the map, yeah nigga know I'm running that
Ball all day and all night, then I run it back
Need a new ho, my old bitch, I'm tired of fucking that
Told my niggas we gon' get this money, I ain't looking back
Catch me switching deals in that Rari', not a Pontiac
Bitches looking at me cause that's where the money's at
Fast lane, fast lane, I be getting mad brain
Glock nine, right side, fuck that mister nice guy
Rollie that I'm rocking make your bitch come out her underwear
Swagging in this bitch, them Louis Vuitton's I got a hundred pair
We The Best, nothing less, YMCMB boy
I be in that SUV with killers from the D boy
Hell yeah, fucking right, I ball every fucking night
What's up with your friend and them, nigga trying to fuck tonight
Sparkler, sparkler, they bringing them bottles out
I don't really give a F.U.C.K., I'm passing the molly's out

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Them bad bitches I already know
Real nigga done walked through the door
Shouts out to the niggas getting money, two times we them niggas who run it
I came in this bitch to turn up, turn up, nigga word up
Leggo <i>[x8]</i>
Bad bitches I already know
Real nigga done walked through the door
Shouts out to the niggas getting money, two times we them niggas who run it

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Drop head phantom, baby you know I'm about that
Pull up to the valet, hella swagging bitches notice that
Hopped up out the whip, my Spanish bitch she got a bubble back
Outfit cost a couple grand, pockets holding forty racks
Leggo, leggo, all my niggas geeked up, Fabo
Chilling in the V.I., they know
Watch a nigga repo, your ho
Ok, niggas standing on top of the sofa, slid in this bitch with my toaster
Twenty five bottles of that potion, Ciroc got them bad bitches open
I said, don't think twice, nigga turn up, turn up, word up
Still shine on a nigga like Vegas, Rolex cost me eighty
Fifty more around my neck, rob me ho nigga you crazy
Cause I'm in this bitch with the goonies, with the toolies, make movies
I said, some of you niggas bout to act up, we just trying to party though
I be in my section like which one of these bitches trying to go
Penthouse on the eighth floor, thirty packs of Trojan's though
Say she down for the team, so I'm like leggo, leggo
