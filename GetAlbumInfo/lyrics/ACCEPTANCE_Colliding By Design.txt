I begin to look
This could only lead to one thing
Breathe and bleed so hard it hurts
Can't stop, can't stop, colliding by design
Tying down my feet to the floor
I get hot when I touch your lips
Leaving you alone on the shore
Sit tight, hold tight

Night after night
Night after night

Let's kiss before you go away
Two burning stars chasing the day
There's a look in your eyes you wanna stay
So let's kiss before you go away

I could feel you closing in
This could only lead to one thing
When I fall, I lose control
Can't stop, can't stop, colliding by design
Standing here so close to your face
I get hot when I touch your lips
Everything else seems out of place
Sit tight, hold tight

Night after night
Night after night

Let's kiss before you go away
Two burning stars chasing the day
There's a look in your eyes you wanna stay
So let's kiss before you go away

Standing here so close to your face
Everything else seems out of place

Let's kiss before you go away
Two burning stars chasing the day
There's a look in your eyes you wanna stay
So let's kiss before you go awayï»¿
