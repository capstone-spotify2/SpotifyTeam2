And when I think of Alonzo-
He was king around the bay
He'd come sporting and flashing
Hearts would drift away

Could be-he had a dream-
Came upon the scene where the
Lamb and lion play
How could he start to school her
Or rule her with feet of sand and clay

Alonzo declared that he must
"Reach to heaven-for heaven"
Alonzo declared that he must
"Reach to heaven-for heaven"

<i>[Repeat from "Could"...to end of chorus]</i>

Don't you know Alonzo put
Out his hand one day
Don't you know Alonzo
lifted up his head to pray

So good for you, my dear Alonzo <i>[x4]</i>

Warm your heart
So warm the sun
Warm your soul

Welcome, Alonzo
So good to see you
Welcome, Alonzo
