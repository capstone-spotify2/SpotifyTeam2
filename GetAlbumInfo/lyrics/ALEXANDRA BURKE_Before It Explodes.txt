Ohhh Ohhh
Is not a question of love
âCause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way

Donât make it harder than it is
We both knew itâd come to this
Better now than in a year
More night of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss
Just let it goâ¦

And stop the madness before it explodes
Before itâs out of our control
Lets stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

Somethings we wont understand
And weâre both so tired of being misunderstood
So lets just turn around and walk away
And hold on to what was good

Donât make it harder than it is
We both knew itâd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss
Just let it goâ¦

And stop the madness before it explodes
Before itâs out of our control
Lets stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

There ainât nothing that can save us
But youâre close to the edge
And whatâs the use of going on
If weâre lying to each other
Every word that is said
Its too late for us now
Cause we can never count down
It's getting close
It's gonna blow

Stop the madness before it explodes
Before is out of our control
Lets stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

Gotta stop the madness ohhh

Five, four, three two, oneâ¦
