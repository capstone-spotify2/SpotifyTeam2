Hiding away, turned into prey
Like we're animals
Yeah, we're loving like we're animals
I know it's your day
(I'm bleeding but it feels right)
Hunting the day
(We're flying through the night like we're animals)
Yeah, we're loving like we're animals
And I fear there's no hide just let it go

'Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
'Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
We're loving like we're animals

Under my skin
(It's killing us, but feels right)
I'm ready to sin
(Baby, take a bite like we're animals)
Yeah, we're loving like we're animals
We're not here to break no hearts
Just let it go

'Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
'Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
We're loving like we're animals

Save your sorrows, save them for tomorrow
In the wild we know

'Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
Cause every single touch don't mean a things
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that we'd just like to be alone
We're loving like we're animals
