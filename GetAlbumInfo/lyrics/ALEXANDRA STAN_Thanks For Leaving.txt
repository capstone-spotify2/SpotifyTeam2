We crashed and burned
A lesson learned
We fell head first
Silly us, so stupid
Our lines got blurred
We walked into the fire
Knowing we'd get burned

But now my love has turned to hate
And I won't spend another day with you inside my head
I know that we all make mistakes
'Cause you're the biggest price I've paid
And now I'm paying off that debt, oh

Go on, sent you packing
So long, you've been slacking
We're so out of reasons
Thank you for leaving
My heart's been re-listed
You have been evicted
You're out, I'm spring cleaning
So thank you and
Thanks for leaving

I broke my rules
Let you play me fool
Thought I was so cool
Silly me, so stupid
How could you be so cruel
Turned me into a big liar
Things I've said I'd never do

But now my love has turned to hate
And I won't spend another day with you inside my head
I know that we all make mistakes
'Cause you're the biggest price I've paid
And now I'm paying off that debt, oh

Go on, sent you packing
So long, you've been slacking
We're so out of reasons
Thank you for leaving
My heart's been re-listed
You have been evicted
You're out, I'm spring cleaning
So thank you and
Thanks for leaving

Every crack in the wall it reminds me of
All the hundred million reasons I put down my gloves
I can't believe this was real
And the picture that still sits by the fireplace
Every time I had to see your little stupid face
I don't think I can deal

Go on, sent you packing
So long, you've been slacking
We're so out of reasons
Thank you for leaving
My heart's been re-listed
You have been evicted
You're out, I'm spring cleaning
So thank you and
Thanks for leaving
