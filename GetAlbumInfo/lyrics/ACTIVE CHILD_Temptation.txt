You recognize my fear's own sight
Ice been down all on your spine
I knew I couldn't let you get away
You make me wanna see a brighter day

Show me tonight
Oh I've waited so long
My desire
Waited so long
Show me tonight
Oh I've waited so long
My desire
Waited so long

No more than just a one night stand
No regrets, no future plans
Addicted to the games we play
But I know that you can't stay

Show me tonight
Oh I've waited so long
My desire
Waited so long
Show me tonight
Oh I've waited so long
My desire
Waited so long
