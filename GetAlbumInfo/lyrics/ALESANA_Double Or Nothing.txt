Time spins it's hands and reveals dire plans
Locked and loaded, pull the trigger
Destined to rise, we've got nothing to lose
Destined to rise and to fall
Hold your breath

Oh my God It's all happening
Seems it's more than a fairy tale
Whispers control our fate
Wings of Icarus if you burn too quickly
From ashes we will rise

Will we fly? Will we die?
In the unknown you have to question fantasy
Let's see what we're made of
Panic. Motivation.
Swallow the doubt and suffocate the urgency
There's no turning back now
Chaos is a ladder

Silently you told yourself that this was all a joke despite my faith
Look me in the eye, say it to my face, tell me I will fail
And I will prove you wrong

One final chance to give up and go back
To hell with that, onward we march!

Oh my God It's all happening
Seems it's more than a fairy tale
Whispers control our fate
Wings of Icarus if you burn too quickly
From ashes we will rise

Will we fly? Will we die?
In the unknown you have to question fantasy
Let's see what we're made of
Panic. Motivation.
Swallow the doubt and suffocate the urgency
There's no turning back now
Chaos is a ladder

Will we fly? Will we die?
Soon they will be seeing what we are believing
