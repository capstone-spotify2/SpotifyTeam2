On the couch. On the floor. On the bed, on the door, I want more, here we goâ¦now congratulate me!! <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Starts out with a pipe dream
White Tee and an ice cream
All day on MySpace
MJ trying to buy face
I had to pay dues, had to make moves on faith
Even got booed off stage
Trying to put food on plate, dropped a couple jewels on tape
Now we got views on Base
So much love, Trust funds and Gazlam
Bad chick in my address, she showing up with that plus one
Through depths and peaks, wolves dressed to sheeps
Better protect the key, while I pen this acceptance speech

Do you see what it took? Is it clearer?
Who you see when you look in the mirror?
All the dreams and fantasies that come together
I'll be shining like the diamond thatâs forever

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Now congratulate me <i>[x8]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Now this is the moment Iâve been waiting for my whole life
Didnât believe it til I seen it with my own eyes
Imma need a black tux and a bow tie
Double cup white chucks and a strobe light
Niggas had bad luck when they roll dice
The numbers add up and they donât lie
Showtime, my bread butter on both sides
Take it to the champagne from the Morvite
Now everybody come on! <i>[Bob Mabena impersonation]</i>
Aw bula Boot (Awâ bula boot!)
JC le Roux (aw bona!)
Thatâs all I think about, sitting up in my room (sitting up in my room)
Aw kuze kuse! (Aw kuze kuse)
Aw gin and juice (Aw gin and juice)
Itâs all coming back to me, like dejavu!

<i>[Sample/Hook:]</i>
Now congratulate me <i>[x8]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Think back to my old days
All I wanted was a gold chain
So stuck in my old ways, now we all household names
What you know about sacrifice, flashing flights, rites of passage to bragging rights?
Bad romances, packs of pampers, and this ainât time to be camera shy
My one homie got a gun in the cupboard
My other homie got a bun in the oven
Baby mama getting big in the stomach
Pop champagne on the four cousins
I think itâs time to be a man now
I feel like moving to my granâs house
Everybody lined up for a handout
Really I just wanna make my old man proud

Do you see what it took? Is it clearer?
Who you see when you look in the mirror?
All the dreams and fantasies that come together
I'll be shining like the diamond thatâs forever
