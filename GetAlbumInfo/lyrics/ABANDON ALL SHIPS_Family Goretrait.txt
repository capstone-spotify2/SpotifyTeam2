Do you ever go home to a place where you don't belong.
Where the feeling of neglect can be oh so strong.
Where everything you try to say or do is always fucking wrong.
When everything around you is a sad, sad, sad song.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
So dance with me on these broken dreams.
If only, if only these walls could scream.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
Forget the broken promises this is now our fate.
Not knowing why they're given power to create.
When broken is the only word in which you can relate.
When everything you love became the only thing you hate.
So come on, come on and dance with me on these broken dreams
If only these walls could scream.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
I wanna see you all burn.
