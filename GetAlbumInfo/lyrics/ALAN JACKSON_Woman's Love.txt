I have felt it
And I have held it
I have known
A woman's love 
I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never understand 
All the little things
That make it grand 
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never come face to face 
With any thing
That takes the place 
Of a woman's love

Well, I have kiss it
Tried to resist it 
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never understand 
All the little things
That make it grand 
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never come face to face 
With any thing
That takes the place 
Of a woman's love

Well I have needed
And I have pleaded 
And I have lost
A woman's love 
And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never understand 
All the little things
That make it grand 
A woman's love

And I know
I'll never come face to face 
With any thing
That takes the place 
Of a woman's love

Well I adore it
And thank God for it
A woman's love...
