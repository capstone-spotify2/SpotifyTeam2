Let's go! Oh, yeah!

Spent all of my life breaking all the rules
Stepping out of line, the streets are my school
Canât get enough of a good time
Gonna live it up while still alive


Iâm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Iâm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Iâd rather burn up in flames than fade away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta hit and run
You gotta live it up

The devil may care, but I donât give a damn
To hell with the reason, itâs all a scam
You got the invitation, I got the booze
Life's a vacation when thereâs nothing to lose

Iâm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Iâm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Iâd rather burn up in flames than fade away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta hit and run
You gotta live it up

Ah yeah

Run the red lights
Sleep when I die
Donât you ever tell me to stop
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up

Iâm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Iâm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta hit and run
You gotta live it up
Oh live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta hit and run
You gotta live it up

Iâm a hell raiser

Run the red lights
Sleep when I die
Donât you ever tell me to stop
You gotta live it up
