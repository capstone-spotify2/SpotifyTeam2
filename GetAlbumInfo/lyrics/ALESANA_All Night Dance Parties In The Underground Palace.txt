Beautiful, you know you leave me breathless when you fall into my eyes
My heart belongs to you my angel
There is just no reason for you to let life bring you down
Please come with me and let me show you

I know that at times it may be hard to let go of yourself
Babygirl, tonight leave your cares behind because it's time to celebrate!
All night long I'll sing and dance with you, my sweet princess, only if you trust in this
Take my hand and follow me, I will sweep you off of your feet
All night long I will sing and dance with you

Every time I look at you I can't believe how magical you are
The stars belong to you my angel
Run away with me into a world where time seems to not exist
The smile on my face will show you

I know that at times it may be hard to let go of yourself
Babygirl, tonight leave your cares behind because it's time to celebrate!
All night long I will sing and dance with you, my sweet princess, only if you trust in this
Take my hand and follow me, I will sweep you off of your feet
This night will only end when we stop dancing

My sweet princess I will sing and dance with you all night long
The stars, they belong to you my angel

All night long I'll sing and dance with you. my sweet princess, only if you trust in this
Take my hand and follow me, I will sweep you off your feet
This night will only end when we stop...
