They say the time has come for us to start again
I believe that's true
They say the time has come for us to make amends
And I believe that too
Why tell me why?
Is it all so hard to find?
I pray each day

For a perfect world
Where children are laughing
Lovers romancing
Time stands still
A perfect world
There's nothing to cry for
No on to die for
Wonderful
In a perfect world

Our father's father says that things were better than
How easy they forget
On every page in every book of history a thousand tears were shed
There's hope in our hearts and love in our eyes
Day after day I keep searching
Why tell me why
Is it all so hard to find?
I pray each day

For a perfect world...

Travel cross the seven seas to be with you
Passion and desire will see me through
The road that I must travel will eind and curl
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world
