You know I always felt
That no-one had been hit as hard as me
Come on just like the great pretender
Oh, until I met Billy

Man without love is a wrinkled man

He was a fighter and a brave one 
Oh so close to number one
He made a move for Marciano 
When he called this man a bum

Man without love is a wrinkled man

I love that motion, emotion, emotion
I love that motion, emotion, emotion

You know we share a love of London 
All its streets, it's good, it's fun
Like Peter Finch, the Hellfire Club 
And wild man Harris to name just one

Man without love is a wrinkled man

And this here song is for you Billy 
For your grace, respect and fire
And if I drank I'd raise a glass real high 
Or maybe even higher

Man without love is a wrinkled man

I love that motion, emotion, emotion
I love that motion, emotion, emotion

And in the back of that new Jag 
You slowly smiled as we passed through
It gave us strength through plague and fire 
And it gave us men like you

Man without love is a wrinkled man

We really love Peter the painter
Sidney Street he met his end
We really hate that bastard Churchill 
And his bully boys he sent

Man without love, yeah, is a wrinkled man

I love that motion, emotion, emotion
I love that motion, emotion, emotion
