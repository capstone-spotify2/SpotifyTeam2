I feel just like your love tonight
So who's to say I'm wrong
I've got to say I feel just right
It's never been so strong

There seems so many points to make
But I feel this is a big mistake
We're so old and this is new
But I've really got to tell you
I always said that you should remain free
But that was up to you and not to me
I started strong but I met someone
You know how long it's been

That's how the whole thing started
That's how the whole thing started

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's how the whole thing started
That's how the whole thing started
That's how the whole thing started
That's how the whole thing started
<i>[Repeat]</i>

Baby, Baby it's wrong
But I've been in and out of love so long
Here we stand not more than friends
I broke your heart again

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Sit down with me and we can talk about it peacefully
We're under the strain of a losing game
That's how it must be

That's how the whole thing started
That's how the whole thing started

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

I feel just like your love tonight
So who's to say I'm wrong
I've got to say I feel just right
It's never been so strong
