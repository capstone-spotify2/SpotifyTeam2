Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there too long my love 
All that time without a word 
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget
I'd regret

The special love I had for you
My Baby Blue

All those days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know
I would show

The special love I had for you
My Baby Blue

What can I do?
What can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you?
Show me a way 
Don't you know the times I've tried

Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger every day
Just one thing before I go
Take good care baby, and let me know
Let it grow

The special love you had for me
My Dixie dear
