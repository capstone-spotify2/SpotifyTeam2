You wanna stay
You wanna go
You just don't know
And then you turn to walk away
I feel a break
And I can't take
How it makes me wanna
Chase you all around
Try and hold you back
From making a big mistake

Don't pull your love out on me baby
Cause if you did I might go crazy
I wanna love you like I can
Cause I only love one man
Don't pull your love out on me baby, baby

I do my best
And all the rest
We come so close
And then you're scared of how it feels
To lose control
But if you won't
How will we ever know if
You and I could be
Everything we need
Don't tell me you don't wanna see

Don't pull your love out on me baby
Cause if you did I might go crazy
I wanna love you like I can
Cause I only love one man
Don't pull your love out on me baby, baby
Don't pull your love out on me baby

Cause if you did I might go crazy
I wanna love you like I can
Cause I only love one man
Don't pull your love out on me baby, baby

Oh and I've tried to let you go
But my heart just won't accept
That it's wrong
To keep holding on
When you believe in love
Don't pull your love out on me baby
I might go crazy
Don't pull your love out on me baby
Don't do it baby

Don't pull your love out on me baby
Cause if you did I might go crazy
I wanna love you like I can
Cause I only love one man
Don't pull your love out on me baby, baby

Don't pull your love out on me baby
Cause if you did I might go crazy
I wanna love you like I can
Cause I only love one man
Don't pull your love out on me baby, baby
