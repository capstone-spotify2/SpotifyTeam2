He was Johnny on the spot, he was red hot
Walked slow and smoked a lot
She was a Jukebox Junkie, hand on one hip
Great big eyes and bright red lips
I said hey, yeah-hey-hey

They eased on out to the centre of the floor
They started dancing like never before
She's spinnin' like crazy, crashing into the crowd
On top of two tables, screaming right out loud

I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna take this town
'Cos I light up when the sun goes down
I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna shake this place
'Cos I wanna die with a smile on my face
I said hey, yeah-hey-hey
I said hey, yeah-hey-hey

The whole damn place spilled into the street
Climbing on cars, high on this heat
Up on the roof, Johnny jived with his date
Cops came by, it was far too late
I said hey, a-hey

When Johnny came to, his head was a mess
Woke up, dreamin' 'bout a skin-tight dress
He found a message at the end of his bed
But the words he can't get right out of his head

I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna take this town
'Cos I light up when the sun goes down
I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna shake this place
'Cos I wanna die with a smile on my face
I said hey, yeah-hey-hey
I said hey, yeah-hey-hey

I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna take this town (take this town)
I wanna rock this joint (rock this joint)
I wanna shake this place (shake this place)
'Cos I light up when the sun goes down
'Cos I wanna die with a smile on my face
I said hey, hey-hey-hey
I said hey, hey-hey-hey
