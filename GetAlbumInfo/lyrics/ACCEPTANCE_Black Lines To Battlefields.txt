Hard times, 
the throw is off line, 
pictures of black and gray
soft minds, 
backed up by hard drives, 
standing in single file

anything
to past the test, you passed the test

like screaming in the air, 
the sound for all who care, 
the siren rings in vain
when lightning hits the ground, 
to all who stand around, 
the shock of ignorance

Black lines, 
can turn to battlefields, 
when they are drawn in pen,
the stop signs like human apathy, 
can cause a fatal crash

like screaming in the air, 
the sound for all who care, 
the siren rings in vain
when lightning hits the ground, 
to all who stand around, 
the shock of ignorance

the feeling hard to tell,
a word can break the spell

hard times, 
the throw is off line, 
pictures of black and gray

like screaming in the air, 
the sound for all who care, 
the siren rings in vain
when lightning hits the ground, 
to all who stand around, 
the shock of ignorance

like screaming in the air, 
the sound for all who care, 
the siren rings in vain
when lighting hits the ground, 
to all who stand around, 
the shock of ignorance
