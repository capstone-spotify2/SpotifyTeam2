I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style

Can we pull out those old feelin's
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust

That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know

Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair

That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
