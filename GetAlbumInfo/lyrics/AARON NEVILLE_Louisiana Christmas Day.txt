I'm a family man
I wasn't born to roam
But it seems like every Christmas time
It makes me farther from my home
I love singin' my song, but it get's me down
To hang my stockin' in some hotel
When the fat man comes to town

But, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
This year I'll be home come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama, I'm gonna find a way
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day

Way up in the bayou there won't be snow
But my friends all envite my 'round
For a Christmas fay do-do
I'm gonna hop a plane or use my thumb
But you best believe I'll be 'round that tree
When Christmas morning comes

Oooh, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day

But, it's alright (alright)
It's gonna be okay (gonna be okay)
I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama (mama), I'm gonna find a way (gonna find a way)
Yeah, I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day

It's gonna be alright (alright)
It's gonna be okay (gonna be okay)
I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama (mama), I'm gonna find a way (gonna find a way)
Yeah, I'll be home (I'll be home)
For the Louisiana Christmas day
