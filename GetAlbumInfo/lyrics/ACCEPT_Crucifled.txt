Life is like a slot machine
Nothing's guaranteed
You might give your soul away
To cut yourself a deal

I really hate uncertainty
Will I win or lose

Ain't norhing but a game
going insane - roll the dice again
Crucified - deep inside
I'm feeling crucified

Life is like a lottery
Can I ever win
Will it be another one
or me - who's cashing in

Ain't nothing but a game
going insane - roll the dice again

Crucified  - deep inside
I'm feeling crucified
