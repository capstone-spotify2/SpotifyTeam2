I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?

You know I got a jacked up pickup truck
with mud flaps and a 4-wheel drive.
I got it decked out like a Country pimp
I'll even let you twirl my fuzzy dice.
'Cause I'm a blue collar redneck
crazy white boy from the south
And if you see any folk got a problem with that
Sweet Potato Pie shut your mouth!

I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?

If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd on the radio
let me know and I'll sing you 'Free Bird'.
I like Johnny Cash Grand Master Flash
I'm name droppin' like you never heard.
I won't try it unless you fry it
put the Crisco in the pan.
I love fresh fried red hot hush puppies.
I got gravy running down my chin.

I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?

Now all these hot senoritas want to ride with me
I got 'em crawling up the side of my GMC.
Country Boys got my back,
Country Girls on my hook.
My 30-30 shined up and she lookin' good.
An' someone flyin' on my redneck roots,
knocking my gold belt buckle and my snake skin boots.
But I'm in it to win it so place your bets
and tell the whole world that I'm the Honky Tonk Kid.

I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.

and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?
