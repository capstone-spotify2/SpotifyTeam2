Hard to get, impossible to hold
Straight as an arrow, like a burning fuse
In the long cold dawn by the side of the road
A hopeless case, a perfect thing

Love is what you want it to be
Love is heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
'Cause love is what I've got for you

I close my eyes, search the stars
Cry for help, wake up cold
You're in my system under my skin
Raw emotion, please don't go

Love is what you want it to be
Love is heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
'Cause love is what I've got for you

Can't live on promises, won't sleep with lies
Don't understand the things you say 'til I read 'em in your eyes
Gotta run on instinct, gotta go by feel
Gotta trust my senses to know if it's for real

Can't live on promises, won't sleep with lies
Don't understand the things you say 'til I read 'em in your eyes
Gotta run on instinct, gotta go by feel
Gotta trust my senses

Love is what you want it to be
Love is heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
'Cause love is what I've got for you

Love is
Love is, love is
Show me, hey
Love is, love is
Show me
