Could I be the one?

Could I be the one that you're thinking of
My goal is to be the one you're dreaming of
I wanna be your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Trust me and I'll never let you down

Let me be with you through all your hard times
I wanna be around when the chips are down
It'll be me and you, against the opposition
Can't you see our love shinning through?

You've been there to solve all of my problems
You've been there to help me solve them
I don't know what, I don't know what to do 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Could I be the one?)
Trust me with your dreams, I'll make them all come true
For the rest of my life, I'll be grateful to you
Time will pass, our love will last
I'll spend my life cherishing you

(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one in your life at the end of the rainbow
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one that you love so
Late at night, the time is right
I wanna be the one you say is out of sight

(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one, let you be the girl
(Let me be the one)
Let me be, let me be the one, at the end of the rainbow
Oh, I'll never, never, never let you down

(Let me be the one)
Oh, I've got to be the one, let me be the one, be the one, oh yeah
At the end of the rainbow, I'll never, never, let you down
(Let me be the one, let me be the one)
