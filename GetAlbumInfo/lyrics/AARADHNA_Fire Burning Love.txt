If you ask me
What our loveâs all about
I would say our love is like a flower
With the petals pulled out

No one to try to put us down baby
Because I love you too much and 
You love me too but
Thereâs just some problems that we gotta work through time

Thereâs not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know

Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again

Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again

Bittersweet memories
Of how we used to be
I know right now weâre still together
But the fire and passion is gone

Itâs killing me
Every day
Because our love ainât the same
And every night I pray please God donât take my baby away

Oh time
Thereâs not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know

Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again

Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again

You used to hold me real close
And I didnât let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away

You used to hold me real close
And I didnât let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away

Fire burning love
