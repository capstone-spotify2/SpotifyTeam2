You sink your teeth and bite the blood that drains the life inside of me 
and fills your soul with love and hate and all those things you need to breathe. 
My body dies but still my soul remains eternally 
in search of Caspian waves and shallow graves explain why me?

This nightmare won't last long. 
Are you scared? So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side. 
Tonight we've got a chance.

I watched the sky bleed grey with see through shades of violent bloody stains 
and felt the evil prime and wicked start a course straight through my veins. 
I'm so alive, my skin so cold and fake I close my eyes 
I know that now's the time to take my chance with death and realize.

Sunrise, sunset will you wash away the rain. 
Sunrise, sunset can you wash away the pain.

This nightmare won't last long. 
Are you scared? So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side. 
Tonight we've got a chance.

This nightmare won't last long. 
Are you scared? So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side. 
Tonight we've got a chance.

So mute and beautiful to me a promise kept on high, 
an angelic look at life through open eyes. 
Don't be scared we'll make it work, 
we're right on time don't make things worse 
now I'm right there by your side.

(Sunrise) I will avenge, (sunset) I can't pretend, 
(Sunrise) I wont forget this vein (sunset) attempt and promise kept, 
just one more night to make up for the loss of love and time 
here comes the sun to rid this world of see through blood and swollen light.

Sunrise, sunset will you wash away the rain. 
Sunrise, sunset can you wash away the pain.

This nightmare won't last long. 
Are you scared? So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side. 
Tonight we've got a chance.

This nightmare won't last long. 
Are you scared? So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side. 
Tonight we've got a chance.

The sunrise..
The last sunrise
The last sunrise
The last sunrise
