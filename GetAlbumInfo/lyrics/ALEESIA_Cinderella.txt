Look up in the sky
See the sun
Feel the heat
If only you were beside me
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

I could feel your touch
Feel your heart
Feel it beat
I know you're my prince charming
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Oou, what you do to me?
You pull me close
You whisper in my ear
I pull you closer

Time is running out
But I know what I want
Trust me, I know what want
What I want, what I want

I wanna to be with you
I wanna to be with you
So baby, take me out tonight

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
So let me be your Cinderella

I'm your's tonight
Let me be your Cinderella
I'm your's tonight
So let me be your Cinderella

Look out in the sky
See the stars
See our place
I am wishing I could be with you
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

If I could see you now
Kiss your lips
Touch your face
My fairy tale will come true
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Oou, what you do to me?
You pull me close
You whisper in my ear
I pull you closer

Time is running out
I know what I want
Trust me, I know what I want
What I want, what I want

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
So baby, take me out tonight

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
So let me be your Cinderella

Let me be your Cinderella
