You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd, tonight

If I just had the chance to just cup on up
Just a life will do where I'll plead
If had the chance to just rock on up,
They'll be no me without you
See I'm not the type to get romantic
But you're bringing it out of me
And I'm not the type to ever cuff my chick
But I'll make sure you don't leave

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day

You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, you're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight

Baby you took my breath away
When I look at you, it gets so hard to just breath
And the way you move makes me wanna attack you
Especially when you on me
Got the club surrounded by all this movement moves like the waves on the sea,
Like the waves on a sea
Don't ever want you to leave

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day

You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day
So we can dance the night away like it's your day

You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side
You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight
