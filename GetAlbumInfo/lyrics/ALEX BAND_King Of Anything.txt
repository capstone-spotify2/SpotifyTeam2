I see you in my dreams
Bringing back old memories
Of how things may have been
If I'd never fallen in
Release me
Release me
Release me now

Cause I've tried
Tried too many times
It's time I say goodbye my queen
I don't wanna be the king of anything
Yeah I lied
But you can't say you tried
Like me
See I don't wanna be the king of anything

What happened to us?
Can't get back the way it was, love
All is heavy suddenly
Please, can you take some of this weight
That you put on me
Release me
Release me
Free me now
If you ever loved me let me go

Cause I've tried
Tried too many times
It's time I say goodbye my queen
I don't wanna be the king of anything
Yeah I lied
But you can't say you tried
Like me
See I don't wanna be the king of anything

I'm taking this crown off my head
I'm throwing the keys to the castle away
I could never fill the throne
You'll rule the world alone, always

I see you in my dreams
Nothing but a memory

Cause I've tried
Tried too many times
It's time I say goodbye my queen
I don't wanna be the king of anything
Yeah I lied
But you can't say you tried
Like me
See I don't wanna be the king of anything
I don't wanna be the king of anything
I don't wanna be the king of anything
