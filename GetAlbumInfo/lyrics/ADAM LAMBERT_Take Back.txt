All you ever think is "Gimme, gimme"
But you never give back (eh eh ay)
All I ever do is overthink and drink
Until I attack (eh eh ay)

We know how to talk it into the ground
We know how to wear it out
If we ain't gon say that
Gonna end up in a grave and baby

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...

Hey

I fed you a fantasy
But you've been drunk on reality (eh eh ay)
All you want is to be wanted
As long as you get it out of me (eh eh ay)

We used to be a jungle, sticky and wild
It used to be we owned the night
All the stupid games we play
And all the shit that we've been sayin
(Eh eh ey)

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins.
When love breaks down, we both die.
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...

Remember remember the first time we collided
We lost it we lost it
Yeaaaaaah!

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How we take back what's been done,
What's been said?
Oh my...

Ohh my
How do we take back...
