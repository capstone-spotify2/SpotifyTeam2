This year is gonna be incredible
This year is gonna be the one
All the planets are lining up for me
This year I'm gonna have fun
This year I'll paint my masterpiece
This year I'll be recognized
I can feel
I'll fall in love for real
This year, this year

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
January
I learn to fly
February
Love's gonna find me
March, April, May
I'll get carried away
Oh, oh

This year I will reach the pinnacle
This year I'll get to the top
People will ask
Where she get's that energy?
This year I'm never gonna stop

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Oh, oh oh oh
This year is gonna be incredible
This year is gonna be the one
All the planets are lining up for me
This year I'm gonna have fun
I'm gonna have fun
Just watch me this year
