I might fall in love tomorrow
I might catch a falling star
I could read that book I borrowed
I could try to make a start

It's so hard to fight the darkness
When I can't push out the noise
All the people waiting for me
To do something with my voice

I might fall in love tomorrow 
I might make a friend or more
I might overcome my sorrow
I might feel a bit more sure

If I fall in love tomorrow
Would anything make sense at all?
Or would it be a move as hollow
As waiting for a star to form

No, I won't fall in love tomorrow
I won't find a love to last
I won't step beyond my shadow
What I want won't come to pass
