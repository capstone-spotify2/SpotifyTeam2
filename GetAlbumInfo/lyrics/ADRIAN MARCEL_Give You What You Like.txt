Please wrap your drunken hands around me
I'll let you call me yours tonight 
Cuz slightly broken is just what I need 
If you give me what I want then I'll give you what you like
Please tell me I'm your one and only
Or lie and say at least tonight 
I've got a brand new cure for lonely 
If you give me what I want then I'll give you what you like 

When you turn off the lights 
I see stars in my eyes, is this love?
Maybe someday 
So don't turn off the lights 
I'll give you what you like 

Emotions aren't that hard to borrow 
When loves the words you never learned 
And in this room of empty bottles 
If you don't give me what I want 
Then you'll get what you deserve 

When you turn off the lights 
I see stars in my eyes, is this love?
Maybe someday
Got this scene in my head 
I'm not sure how it ends, is this love?
Maybe one day 
So don't turn off the lights 
I'll give you want you like 

I'll give you one last chance to hold me 
If you give me one last cigarette
By now it's early in the morning 
I done gave you what you want 
All I want is to forget 

When you turn off the lights 
I get stars in my eyes, is this love?
Maybe one day 
Got this scene in my head 
I'm not sure how it ends, is this love?
Maybe one day 
So don't turn off the lights 
I'll give you want you like
