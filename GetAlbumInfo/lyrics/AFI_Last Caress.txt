Well I got something to say,
I killed your baby today,
And it, doesn't matter much to me,
as long as it's dead.

Well I got something to say,
I raped your Mother today,
And it, doesn't matter much to me,
as long as she's spread.

Sweet lovely death, i've been waiting for your breath,
oh sweet death, one last caress.

Go!
