Honey I know we've seen bad weather
But what've we lost that's not already gone?
I'm a legionnaire of forces
Climb the walls and burn it down

Fall like dominos

I'm a legionnaire of forces now
(Keep it down now)
So meet me in the wilderness
I'm always on your side
To be with you

Honey I know we've seen bad weather
But what do you know?
It's already gone
We'll watch that empire fall to pieces
A paper tiger ringleader

Fall like dominos

I'm a legionnaire of forces now
(Keep it down now)
So meet me in the wilderness
You and I were made for something more
(Keep it down now)
So cast a light and clear me out
I'm always on your side
To be with you
