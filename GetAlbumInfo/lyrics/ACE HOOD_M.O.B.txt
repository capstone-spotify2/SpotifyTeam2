<i>[Intro]</i>
At the end of the day my nigga
I do this shit for my family
And my niggas dawg
You feel me?

<i>[Hook]</i>
Lord knows Iâm a go getter
Lord knows Iâm a go getter
I chase that money every 24
I chase that money every 24
Lord knows Iâll always be a real nigga
Lord knows Iâll never be a fuck nigga
I chase that money every 24
Money over bitches, you know how it go

<i>[Verse]</i>
You lookin at the hottest nigga in the city
Fuck the city, how this nigga in my state?
Free the nigga Boosie Boo, I hope he beat the case
Keepin blunt and counting money, nigga thatâs every day
Back and Iâm on my block lookin like 100 bricks
Nigga donât want no problem, choppa catch a 50
Chain so disrespectful yall should slap my jeweler
Walkin around this bitch, I think Iâm with The Ruler
Countin another mill, Iâm screamin hallelujah
Spit the type of dope that get shipped yall to Cuba
Anybody want that work I got a clean cut
My shitâ so potent youâll be high for 3 months
Foreign cars, crib look like a fuckin mall
Hurt myself as sport but found a way to ball
I pray you pussy niggas life a living hell
Fuck that countin money, weigh it on a scale
Nigga

<i>[Verse]</i>
So much people like that waitin on me to fail
Answer to that question, coldest day in hell
Fuck nigga talkin tough, gon make me take it there
I move like a turtle mean I keep them shells
Lost so many niggas to this fuckin struggle
RIP for Fif, he was like my fuckin brother
Runnin up and down them streets, in and off that Chevy Bubble
Show a nigga getting that money, all we do is hustle
Ainât no food in refrigerator nor the shelf
Ainât no handouts here, I did this shit myself
Lil mam said that pussy good, Iâm tryina see it then
Guaranteed she bust it once she see the Benz
Everyone knows I am a go getter
Tryina stay away from all you fuck niggas
Aye like that boy be on some other shit
Fuck a hater, you can run and tell em this

<i>[Hook]</i>
Lord knows Iâm a go getter

Money over bitches, you know how it go

<i>[Verse]</i>
All this cash, I can drink to a nigga
Canât even fit in these jeans my nigga
Wonât give a damn, we gon flex on the hood
Bit for you honey, Iâm like the one that fucked the police, I paid for the ticket
Thrown bout 100 in the air, I admit it
My bad, I ainât show no love
Putting money over all these bitches
What you doin you lame we did it
Now we going where these niggas canât go
Stayed on grass as long as they donât get it
Theyâll get this, all they got like hoes
I swear boy it ainât no different
Well we wonât get the same 24
I go hard every chance I get
Stepped in the plane, thought all would be Rolls
Aye donât mention so low, but my mind belong to these racks
Slingin this paper right on these strippers
How the club owner callin me by
Bitch I had, she was aâight
Last time at show she al that
I really wanna tip drip
That bitch no, she sex it to the max
I paid for it, it ainât on the paper
I been getting it since too easy
I might blow ahead, make it back
And I got summoned here for no reason
I see you flashin for the night
But guess what nigga we do this all season
You could go and sit where you can watch me
And then one of you niggas donât believe me
That rough

<i>[Hook]</i>
Lord knows Iâm a go getter
Lord knows Iâm a go getter
I chase that money every 24
I chase that money every 24
Lord knows Iâll always be a real nigga
Lord knows Iâll never be a fuck nigga
I chase that money every 24
Money over bitches, you know how it go
