We had the right love 
At the wrong time 
Guess I always knew inside 
I wouldn't have you for a long time 

Those dreams of yours 
Are shining on distant shores 
And if they're calling you away 
I have no right to make you stay 

But somewhere down the road 
Our roads are gonna cross again 
It doesn't really matter when 
But somewhere down the road 
I know that heart of yours 
Will come to see 
That you belong with me 

Sometimes good-byes are not forever 
It doesn't matter if you're gone 
I still believe in us together 
I understand more than you think I can 
You have to go out on your own 
So you can find your way back home 

And somewhere down the road 
Our roads are gonna cross again 
It doesn't really matter when 
But somewhere down the road 
I know that heart of yours 
Will come to see 
That you belong with me 

Letting go 
Is just another way to say I 
Always love you 
so... 

We had the right love 
At the wrong time 
Maybe we've only just begun 
Maybe the best is yet to come 
'Cause 

Somewhere down the road 
Our roads are gonna cross again 
It doesn't really matter when 
But somewhere down the road 
I know that heart of yours 
Will come to see 
That you belong with me
