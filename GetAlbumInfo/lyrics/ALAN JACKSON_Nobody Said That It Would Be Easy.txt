Nobody said that it would be easy
To take away my walkin' shoes
Cause honey I found I can't settle down
On my road there's another town
Where the people wanna hear a man
who sings the blues

Nobody said that it would be easy
Stay at home all alone
Honey I found I can't settle down
With you,
My road, there's another town
I gotta keep movin'
I gotta keep rollin' on

Some say I'm a fool
Crazy fanatic
Dreamer
Drifter
And more

I guess it's true
Like getting static
For a new pair of boots
And the way out the door

Nobody said that it would be easy
Sometimes you'll get confused
But honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
There's another town
Where the people wanna hear a man
Who sings the blues

Some say I'm a fool
Crazy fanatic
A dreamer a drifter and more
I guess it's true
Cause I get ecsatic
For a new pair of boots
and a way out the door

Nobody said that it would be easy
Sometimes you'll get confused
But honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
There's another town
Where the people wanan hear a man
Who sings the blues
Yeah honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
There's another town
Where the people wanna hear a man
Who sings the blues
