You ain't comin round here talkin all that shit
Talkin bout look at all them bricks

Gun cocked, where his children
No talk, time to get em
Fake niggas gon make me kill em
Make his body shiver like hes naked in a river
Matter of fact umma leave him in da river
Come and get him when it's winter nigga holla back

Roc boy bitch hova back
Tell ya movin dem stabs of crack
See nigga you a lie like pac is back
Bend ya niggas all cramped and ya homie won't last
See ya something like paper tags
Don't make me slide dem macs
To save one blast and get his ass

When I pull up in a rova, they know that it's ova
Big hold and ya body like coasters
Creep creep we deep with soldiers
Black hoes that'll carry that toaster
Hot head now they callin me foldiers
But still creep in adidas with dem heatas and dem meters
When I see where your family at
Pop pop just call me ace
Slump niggas umma call you dead
Click clack then your t-shirt red
Hand em a tampon
No batteries included, know that the clip be hands on
And I take your mans arm
Leave his bodie slumped and the damned dawn
