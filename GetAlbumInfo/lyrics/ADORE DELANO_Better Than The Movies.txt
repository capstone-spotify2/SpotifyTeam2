Fading out at black &amp; white
I see technicolor lights
Our names written in the sky
Everything is ours tonight
Gonna leave it all to faith
Show it off like Phoebe Cates
Live it up and blame our age
Young enough to make mistakes

Better than the movies
Better than the movies
Better than the movies
What we get it is all we got
Its better than the movies
<i>[x2]</i>

Every moment is a dream
Everytime we make a scene
Life is like a silver screen
We were born to take the lead
Never gonna let it go
Gonna give them all a show
Walk into the after glow
Stop and let the credits roll

Better than the movies
Better than the movies
Better than the movies
What we get it is all we got
Its better than the movies
<i>[x2]</i>

Better than the movies (So much better than the movies)
Better than the movies (So much better than the movies)
Better than the movies
What we get it is all we got
Is better than the movies

Better than the movies (Better better)
Better than the movies (So much better better)
Better than the movies
What we get it is all we got
Is better than the movies
