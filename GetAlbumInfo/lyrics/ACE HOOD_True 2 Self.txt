Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty..

No, I won't change
No, I won't change
I won't change

Sometimes, I be feelin' like "Fuck rap"
Cause ain't nobody interested in all this real shit
Real
But that be going through my mind on some real shit
Like why this nigga heavy underrated?
That shit got niggas steady contemplatin'
I'm tryna find patience
Tryna find the answers on the daily
I think it's time we have a conversation
But I got limitations
That's probably why I'm in this situation
These rappers just a bunch of imitations
I'm gettin' too impatient
I'm thinkin' shit I'll make a reservation
Probably only way a nigga make it
But that ain't true
Lookin' cold nigga, that's your proof
Overdose on autotune, nigga that ain't you
Sell your soul, it's kinda like I said "I do"
I won't budge, I can't lie
This shit gets tough
To all my fans, I promise you can call my bluff
I'm never one to break that trust
For real

And I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
And that won't change

They like, Ace why you never mentioned in the media
Why that nigga treat you like you needed 'em
Polo in a medium
Niggas gassed up like the helium
What's that 87 to a premium?
He don't get to shine
He don't get the love that he deserve
That shit is gettin' on a nigga's nerves
That shit is too confusing
All of these illusions
Kevin Hart, funny man, these rap dudes, amusing
For the love of music
Gold chains, cubans
Rollie on the wrist, I'ma a product of abusing
And that's real shit
Tryna rush the rap game, like I call blitz
Made a couple mill, ain't satisfied yet
Shit
I'm more focused on my legacy
How I can aspire gon' require up a better me
So who am I? Be that shredded motherfucker
You should get to know him, you'll love him

And I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
And that won't change

No matter how high or low
I would never ever sell my soul
Say no matter how high or low
I would never ever sell my soul, no

Cause we up, we up, we up, we up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Cause we up, we up, we up, we up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

One more problem
I will not ever follow
I will not ever bother to change and switch up the motto
I'm true to what I believe
And blessings will be received
Supporters will be relieved
To see what we have achieved
That's that inspiration
So no matter what the world might say
I am god fearing, working on myself everyday
And that's okay
I know we all make some mistakes
Nobody's perfect
We all got them demons to face
Bad time or good times
Man I still give thanks
Ain't no such thing as dawg I can't
Ain't no such thing as dawg I can't
Feel me?

To all my fans, I promise you can call my bluff
I'm never one to break that trust
For real

No, I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
And that won't change

I'm still true to myself
I'm still true to myself
I'm still true to myself

And that won't change
And that won't change
