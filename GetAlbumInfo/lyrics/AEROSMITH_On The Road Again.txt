Yeah, woke up one mornin' 
I'm a ram up for walls 
Somethin' told my baby 
You can have it all 
Jump through my window 
Look my life in the den 
Look out pretty mama 
I'm on the road again 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm on the road again 
(And you can do what you want) 
I'm on the road again 
(And you can do what you want) 
Look out pretty mama I'm on the road again...uh

Yeah, I came home last night 
To get my dinner hot 
Went to the door 
But the door was locked 
Jump through the window 
And believe me or not 
She hadn't even 
Put my dinner into the pot 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Yeah, never been evil 
And I've never been shy 
Every down a champ 
And I'm a time by 
Down un winner 
With my apple in bed 
Look out pretty mama 
I'm on the road again 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Yeah, never been evil 
And I've never been sly 
Every down a champ 
And I'm a time by 
Down through the window 
With my apple in bed 
Look out pretty mama 
I'm on the road again

<i>[Chorus]</i>
