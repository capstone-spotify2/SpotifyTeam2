Uhh man, I just want to thank you
Ridin on this muthafuckin' mission with us
From Queens to Boston, all around the muthafuckin' planet

As the ganja gets evaporated
Tellin' all these bitches beat me cause I'm activated
Rockin '97 Maxes with the double bubble wrapped around the bottom
Old Gold twisted like the cap that's on the bottle
Mash on the throttle, swish, shoot expose the ankle
Swiss chocolate lay up in the bed like a blanket
Ready to smang it, smash it and bang it
No more fruit punch in the crib so I guess I'll have to Tang it
Young Bronson, blade runner, Rutger Hauer
Sticky fingers cause that's what I use to crush the sour
Suede shoe like the natives in the teepee
22's drop Z3, get off the peepee
Beep beep, twist the laser key, press the clutch
Shift into the gear, give it gas and then I hit the Dutch
My mind is diamond, have you feelin' like you sniffin' dust
We come in heavy so you better have your shit to bust, pussy!
