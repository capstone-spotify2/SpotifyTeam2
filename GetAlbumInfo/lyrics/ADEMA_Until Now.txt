I knew you all my life, 
Though only through my dreams,
Look inside your mind and see what's on mine.

Calling out my name I see you there, 
This frozen cold,
It isn't fair, 
How much of this pride will I spare,
We are both seething.

All I know (All I know)is to act now and hold on,
This one's the real one
Just calm down, don't look back
This is what we never had,
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes.

Until now it wasn't hard to leave,
I'm wanting more.

Everyone around but still alone,
Try to grasp using the flow,
Use a single emotion,
You left me totally motionless.
So quick, so soft like a theif in the night came here and changed my life.

Everyday the same,
Just sit and stare,
Will I see you up in the air,
These seperate lives we don't share again I'm leaving.

All I know (All I know)is to act now and hold on,
This one's the real one
Just calm down, don't look back
This is what we never had,
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes.

Until now it wasn't hard to leave,
I'm wanting more.

I thought all this time I would end up alone, 
Beside I watch you breathing.

All I know (All I know)is to act now and hold on,
This one's the real one
Just calm down, don't look back
This is what we never had,
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes.

I never felt so alive (until now),
I never felt so alive (until now),
I never felt so alive,
It wasn't hard to leave, I'm wanting more.
