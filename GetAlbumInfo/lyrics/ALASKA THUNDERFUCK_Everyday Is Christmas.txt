I am very rich.
I'm rich in friends.
I'm rich in family.
I'm rich in loved ones.
And, because of all these lovely things in my life.
It doesn't matter what time of year it is.
'Cause the truth is...
Everyday is Christmas.

The presents have all been open.
And Santa's done with his sleigh.
The tree's out in the garbage.
It's about to get hauled away.
We gotta go back to school, now.
The neighbours took down their lights.
It doesn't matter if it's cold out.
'Cause we're gonna be all right.

Christmas...
When it's Halloween.
Christmas...
When it's New Years Eve.
Christmas...
When you're here with me.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas...
Thanksgiving day.
Christmas...
Or the Fifth of May.
Christmas...
It's a holiday.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas.

The fireworks we've been feeling.
Are hotter, than the Fourth of July.
From Summer time to Winter.
I know, you'll still be mine.
We don't need no reindeer.
We don't need candy canes.
'Cause anytime you're with me.
That's my favourite day.

Christmas...
When it's Halloween.
Christmas...
When it's New Years Eve.
Christmas...
When you're here with me.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas...
Thanksgiving day.
Christmas...
Or the Fifth of May.
Christmas...
It's a holiday.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas.

Anytime you're feeling
Lonely &amp; blue (Lonely &amp; blue)
Look inside you're heart
And you'll find Christmas inside you.

Christmas... (Christmas.)
Christmas... (Christmas.)
Christmas... (Christmas.)
Everyday, everyday is Christmas...
Thanksgiving day.
Christmas...
Or the Fifth of May.
Christmas...
It's a holiday.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas.

Monday, &amp; Tuesday, &amp; Wednesday, &amp; Thursday, &amp; Friday, &amp; Saturday, &amp; Sunday, &amp; Monday.
And Arbor Day &amp; Mother's Day.
And Father's Day &amp; Hanukah &amp; Kwanzaa &amp; President's Day.
And Martin Luther King Day &amp; Easter Sunday.
And black history month &amp; St. Patty's Day.
And Election Day.

Everyday, everyday is Christmas.
It's true.
