I see you walking down the street
I catch your eye before we meet
But you look down to check your feet
I wish I'd say are you okay?
You're looking better everyday
But I just smile and walk away
Why did two lovers
End up like strangers
When did we stop seeing eye to eye

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Everyday you took my breath away
But now theres no reply
Only hi, goodbye
Like a dream come true
When it was me and you
Now I just don't know why
We say hi and
Hi and goodbye
(Hi and goodbye)

I know it sounds like a cliche
But when I pass our old cafe
It always feels like yesterday (like yesterday)
We shared a blanket in the cold
To give a promise made of gold
We had a deal through heart and soul
Why did two lovers
End up like strangers
When did we stop seeing eye to eye

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

I remember the way
We always had words to say
And nothing could tear us apart
I knew you by heart
We were eye to eye
Now we're only hi and goodbye
(Hi and goodbye)

<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>

Hi and goodbye (goodbye)
Hi and goodbye
Hi and goodbye (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hi and goodbye (goodbye)
