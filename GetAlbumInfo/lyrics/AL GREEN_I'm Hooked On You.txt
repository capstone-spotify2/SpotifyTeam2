Since I met you, baby
My life, my life has changed
My heart has filled with love
'Cause you made me a brand new man

But I'm missin' you so, I can't let you
It's all in my heart, it can't fall apart
Lovin' you, you know it's true
That I love, I'm loving you, hey

Your love, our love will never die
If it does, I'll, woah, cry
'Cause you showed me so much love to give
Talk about will to live, is this love for real?

So real that it's my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby
It can't fall apart, I'm hooked on you, baby
I've been loving you, you know it's true
And I'm hooked on you, baby

You don't know, I'm hooked on you, baby?
Don't stay too long, I'm hooked on you baby
I've been loving you, and you know it too
That I'm hooked on you

It's all in my heart, I'm hooked on you baby
Don't fall apart, I'm hooked on you baby
To been loving you, I've been proud that it's true
That I'm hooked on you, yeah babe, hey
