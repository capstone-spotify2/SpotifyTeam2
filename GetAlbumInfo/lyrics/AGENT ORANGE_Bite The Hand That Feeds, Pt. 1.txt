i asked a million questions, you looked so surprised
forgot a million things that i had memorized
yes but i confess, i never dreamed
i had done my best, or so it seemed

<i>[chorus]</i>
take the time to waste a thousand years
touch the face and wipe away the tears
speak the truth and break the heart that bleeds
stab the back and bite the hand that feeds

think of things that made you cry when you were young
realize at last your life has just begun
think of lonely places far away
i'm sorry, but i don't know what to say to you

<i>[chorus]</i>

close your eyes - remember me from long ago
never say a word - no one will ever know
think of life the way it was before
imagine what the future has in store for you

<i>[chorus]</i>
