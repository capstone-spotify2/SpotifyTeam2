Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might of got it right
And some people say I drive a cadillac car
Or sell my wares hauntin' hotel bars

I'm the boogie man, the boogie man

I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So little girl, be careful, when you're on your own tonight

I'm your boogie man, your boogie man

And I hope, that you don't misunderstand your boogie man
And don't let the sun come up on me, your boogie man

I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
