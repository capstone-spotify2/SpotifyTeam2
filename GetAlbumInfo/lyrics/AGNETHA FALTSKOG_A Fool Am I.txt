This time your story had better be good
Or I may leave you like I know I should
You say you've missed me while you've been away 
Where'd you go? and who with - that's what I'd like to know
You have the nerve to run off like you do
You don't deserve all the love I give you

Fool am I! what a poor little fool am I!
Oh why can't I be strong enough - long enough
To say that we're through
Fool am I ! Just a poor little fool am I 
But I can't get it understood
You're no good
What can I do?
I can't stop loving you

Tell me you love me - take me and show me 
Make me forgive you again

Fool am I! what a poor little fool am I! 
But I can't get it understood, You're no good 
What can I do?
I can't stop loving you
Oh, tell me - you love me
Take me and show me
Make me forgive you again

Fool am I! what a poor little fool am I! 
Oh why can't I be strong enough - long enough
To say that we're through
Fool am I! Just a poor little fool am I !
But I can't get it understood
You're no good
What can I do?
