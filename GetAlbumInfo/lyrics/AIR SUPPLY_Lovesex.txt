Lovesex, Love sex
Lovesex, I want to be near you I want to be next
Lovesex, it's just like the real thing with special effects

She's dripping in diamonds and making me sweat
Take all my money, take all you can get
I'm tasting the perfume, the scent of your skin
My beautiful neon, I'll believe anything

You say you love me but you don't know my name
I've got your number, I'm feeling the same
I pull you closer but you keep letting me go

Lovesex, Lovesex
Lovesex, I want to be near you I want to be next
Lovesex, it's just like the real thing with special effects

Smile for the camera, my virtual sin
Whatever you're selling you're pulling me in
When the heat starts rising, I'm falling like rain
I'll take all the pleasure and fake all the pain

You say you love me but you don't know my name
I've got your number, I'm feeling the same
I pull you closer but you keep letting me go

Lovesex, Lovesex, Lovesex, Lovesex

Oh, I really love you when we make it slow
Oh, I've got a feeling that I've, I've got a feeling that I've
I've got a feeling that I've, I've got the feeling

Lovesex, I want to be near you, I want to be next
Lovesex, it's just like the real thing with special effects
Lovesex, it's turning from passion into triple X
Lovesex give me the dirty and keep your respect
Lovesex...
