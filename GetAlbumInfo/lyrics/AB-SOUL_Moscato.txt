(You got, you got some more moscato?)

<i>[Ab Soul:]</i>
Yeah
She's a mean girl
I'm a nice guy
We all know opposite attract
Like a rail road
And I like
You to do anything you please
When you're with me
Mama
Let's head home
And crack a bottle of the Sutter's Home
And hit some trees, Why not?
Where your head at
Hope it's in the gutter like mine
Not where you find rats
Talkin' about where you find ecstasy
Come have a lil bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the mornin'
Till the sun has fallin'
Like a new born
Baby you stallin'
You know you want all this
Long dick
Oh shit
Might want to make you my misses
Like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room
Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (What?)
Peek-at-chu
Let's pop this cork
Let me rub on your neck
Till your Victoria's secret get all wet
And your Victoria's secret safe with me
Let me Victoria's secret leave your legs

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I know you had a hard day baby
Relax your mind
Shit
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
Everything was fine

<i>[Hook:]</i>
When things get hard to swallow
We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
Ya love it
We can even do it tomorrow
Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo (mm hum yeah, I know we said P&amp;P Baby)
Puts me in the moment for your lovin' (But now we on somthin' new)
You love it

<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Uh
Guess whose back in this mother fucker
Lookin' like a mother fuckin' chi-town pimp
Alright
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
I'll be in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
With an AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk
Make everybody scream
Put the missing punk
On everybody's screen
Ain't nothin' changed bout the ends I'm holdin'
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed
But a nigga be rollin' with a bad bitch
And the bitch be rollin'
Dolphin pills and moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessey on the bartender bill
Just a good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight
And fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight
Plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite
With a 5-Star freak
Slingin' that dick while baby eat
On her punani
Ooo mommys
Look at yours bodies
I'm geeked
Havin' a good time
Put my
Peen
In a muther fuckin
Bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga don't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)

Uh
I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up

I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up
Alright

Sip slow
Relaxation
That's are motto
