You make me sick

I'll tear out those diamond eyes I can't bear to see
crimson spills on paper skin
they call this tragedy
remembering the nights when you'd whisper to me soft,
"forever more my heart is yours"
realize those words have died

as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care

if I can not be loved (your face disgusts me...) then none shall be
think of this (...smile and bear your lies) as I softly
kiss your blood (this broken trust will...) glazed lips once more
on this night (...become your demise) this thing you call love... dies

as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care

after today silence will haunt you
expect no (expect no) forgiveness
after today (your life...)
silence will haunt you (...will end...)
expect no forgiveness (...tonight)

now I grit my teeth and finish what I know must be done
to kill the memory of you... and you said this would be forever

as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care
