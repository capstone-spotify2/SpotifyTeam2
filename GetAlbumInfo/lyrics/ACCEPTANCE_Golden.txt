We're all just chemicals
We're all just chemicals
You can lose yourself in me
And I feel it when you breathe
We're all just physical
And so subliminal
I can lose myself in you
And you pull, you pull me through

So I'm told, we grow old and move on, and move on
So I'm told, to fear gold, and shiver, shiver
As you hold me close and take me through the night
The two of us are bound to get the ride
We're getting high

And we're all just chemicals
And we're all just chemicals
You can lose yourself in me
And I feel you when you breathe
We're all just physical
And you're so subliminal
And I lose myself in you
And you pull, you pull me through

Check my eyes sharing lies with my head, with my head
I am told, to fear gold, shiver, shiver
As you hold me close and take me through the night
The two of us are bound to get the ride
We're getting high

And we're all just chemicals
We're all just chemicals
Lose myself

It gets better, better than this
It gets better, better than this
So golden, golden
It gets better, better than this
It gets better, better than this
So golden, golden
It gets better, better than this
It gets better, better than this
So golden, golden
It gets better, better than this
It gets better, better than this
So golden, golden

It gets better, better than this
It gets better, better than this
So golden, golden
