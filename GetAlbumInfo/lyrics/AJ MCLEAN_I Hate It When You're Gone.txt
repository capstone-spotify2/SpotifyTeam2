I hate it when I come home
and you're already asleep
I hate it when you throw things out
without talking to me
I hate how you've come to expect
I'll let you down

I hate the way you seem to always make us late
You pick a fight, and I'll take the blame
I hate the way you keep it so cold in this room

I hate how you steal the covers
I hate how you fight with your mother
and more than you're favorite song,
I hate it when you're gone.
Yeah, I hate it when you're gone

I hate it when I ask If I'm the best that you've had
You answer to slow, and then you turn your back
I hate it when you compare me to others that came before

I hate the way you whisper to your friends on the phone
The way you can make me feel so alone
I hate it when I feel like I'm trying to hard

I hate when you're lost in the T.V
I need you where you barely see me
and more than admitting I'm wrong
I hate it when you're gone
Said, I hate it when you're gone

It's always, it's never
You roll your eyes and say whatever
I just go along, I just along..

I hate just how much I adore you
And I hate that I can't be there for you
And more than admitting I'm wrong
I hate it when I see you crying
You say you're okay but you're lying
And more than the dark hates the dawn
I hate it when you're gone
Yeah I hate it when you're gone..
