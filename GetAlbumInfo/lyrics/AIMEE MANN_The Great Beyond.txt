Go, honey go
Into the ocean
Go, honey go
Into the great beyond
'Til you're good and gone
And you can hide away for
When everything goes wrong
Honey, go

Go, honey go
If I were you I would
Leave this neighborhood
Away from people who never
Treat you like they should
Honey, go
Go

In the woods or in the ice and snow
Where there is
No one else you know
You've really nowhere
Else to go
So honey go

Go, honey go
'Cause it's a dead end street
And it's a street in a town
Where winning isn't sweet
And every win
Is the beginning of defeat
So honey, go
Go
