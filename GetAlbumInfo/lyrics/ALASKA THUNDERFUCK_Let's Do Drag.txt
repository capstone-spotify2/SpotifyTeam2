Put some makeup on my face, face
Come on over to my place, place
We done mashed, cooked, and baked, baked
Shake and go, cut the lace, lace

You say that you want it, say that you need it
Say that you want it, that you believe it
Say that you love it, say that you bleed it
Tell me you're mine, mine, mine, mine

Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Gag, gag, gag, gag, gag

<i>[Lady Red Couture:]</i>
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
YAAAAAAAAA!

<i>[Alaska Thunderfuck:]</i>
Nevada nails and Dallas dress, dress
Kill a couch and make a mess, mess
I'm not mad, I'm not pressed, pressed
Uber, put in the address, dress

You say that you want it, say that you need it
Say that you want it, that you believe it
Say that you love it, say that you bleed it
Tell me you're mine, mine, mine, mine

Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag

Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Let's do drag
Gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag
