No you're never gonna be anything more than just another punk band
It's never gonna be anything more than rock and roll
Let's play our song, it's been so many times before
But you keep on listening because you wanna believe that it's possible
Abandon artistic integrity
Drop all pretensions and just lock into the beat
We can have some more in a solid melody

Means so much more than the city and state
Means so much more than fame and adulation
Gonna prove that we're more than our father's sons and daughters
That we're meant for so much more than the future could ever offer
So here we come gunning for revenge
It's a little too late for an apology
Means so much more than they could ever give to us <i>[x2]</i>

I'm not asking for your acceptance
I'm not waiting for you to understand
Means so much more than a lover
Means so much more than the actor
So much more than your complete devotion
So much more than you could ever give to me

And Maybe we'll never see our efforts indicated
Maybe we'll never amount to anything
We're not looking back
We're not making compromises
We are willing to dare
We are willing to believe
If I only had more time
If I only had more words to explain

So much more than the world could ever give to me <i>[x6]</i>
