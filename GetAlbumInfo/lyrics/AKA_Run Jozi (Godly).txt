Started from bottom, was rolling around in that Toyota bakkie
The summer is ours, Iâm hungry for power, Gaddafi Gaddafi
You go to the tube and all that you see is Versace Versace
You go to my school, they can't tell you shit about Chris Hani Chris Hani
This ainât the land of the free, no propaganda machine
Handle my flag on the screen, then light a candle for âDibs
Then light a candle for âDibs, okay
Smoking the jets, smoke, smoking the jets
Smoking them like cigarettes
Taking it straight to the head
Drinking select
This is the sweetest revenge

Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi
I'm holding the crown, my soldiers surround so throw in the towel
We come through the kitchen with owner's permission, no photo's allowed

<i>[K.O:]</i>
My flow is so harzadous
Mfanakithi, canât nobody handle this
I annihilated all my competition so thereâs no further challenges
Look, going against the authority ntwana is totally blasphemous
In the city where having no morality is totally fabulous
Whatâs going on with these amateurs over the internet posting some messages
Next thing you know your career is over, ntwana, over some characters
Itâs the juxtaposition of choosing stupidity over intelligence
Ntombazana ushishiliza ngendunu phansi and you're hoping for happiness
Emhlabeni melâuzâbheke, itâs crucial
Ubothembâitshe than uthembe umuntu
They laugh in your face while they planning to shoot you
Bafuna njukuculelâamagugu
Ngâzobamba ngo-left, ngikâbambe ngo-right, mina kleva Iâll hurt you
We outchea living that Eskom life, yeah we in that power circle
See all I ever wanted was a peace of mind to speak my mind the streets are mine
I havenât even reached my prime, ngâsazokwenza dizzy blind
Ngisazokwenza bsuy blind
Aw mina ngiyântsimbâedlâezinye, redefined
Just read between the lines and when the sparks fly hope you can see the grind
See the grind, yeah

Kâdala sibatshela ukuthi kâphethe thina la
Kodwa kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha
Kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha, kwenzenjani?

<i>[AKA:]</i>
Iâm something like Haile Selassie
Beautiful women and Jah seed
God-speed to my competition
Fuck whatever your palm reads, Iâm on the mission
Like foreign militia, they're politicians in hot seats
Fuck with the gods, top of the charts, name a level I canât reach
Better check credentials, Peter Cech protect your temple
Do you want progress or do you want Rolex?
Better make mine presidential, influential
More gold bottles, no role-models
This whole motto is fucked up, and we all follow
No Gupta gate, no magistrate, just mamiâs shake like cold bottles
Bank notes falling, no foreign, no problem
Madiba faces in briefcases like Zim dollars
Say Our father
