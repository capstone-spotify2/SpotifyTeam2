Did you ever have the feeling
You're the only person living in the world
And people that you see
Are one-dimensional and never there at all
Even just the commonplace
Warm familiar greetings are a lie
Their voices and their faces are as empty
As the space beyond the sky

Marilyn is walking with her scarf
Around her head against the rain
The doorways and the shops fill up with people
And it's pouring down again
A man with an umbrella seems to see her
But he turns and looks away
And nothing really matters 'cause there's
Nothing that she wants to do or say

In the real and unreal
In the real and unreal

As she puts the key inside the door
She's just an ordinary girl
Did you ever have the feeling
You're the only person living in the world

In the real and unreal
In the real and unreal

Tomorrow comes around
And yet she doesn't feel a part of it all
Did you ever have the feeling
You're the only person living in the world
Only person living in the world
Only person living in the world
