As long as you love me <i>[x3]</i>

We're under pressure,
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning 
But hey now (hey now), you know, girl (know girl),
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier,
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress (don't stress), don't cry (don't cry), we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)

As long as you love me 
As long as you love me 

As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)
As long as you lo-o-o-o-o-o love me (love me)

As long as you love me
