You're here, looking like my best friend
Hoping you'll find a way to tell me you just can't stay
You laugh hard at the world I know
Now that the seasons show
You tell me, love, your heart will soon mend

We counted every day
Only to show we needed each other
Who needs a reason to love
When friends just seem to know
They know it
You have lots of dreams I know
Now It's the close of the show
Let's hope it all passes by in the end
So get yourself along
You're my best friend
<i>[Repeat to the end]</i>
