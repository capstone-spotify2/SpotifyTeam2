Two coffins for sleep.
One for you, one for me.
We'll get there eventually.

In the dark of our graves our bodies will decay.
I wish you'd never change.

How lucky I ever was to see
the way that you smiled at me.
Your little moon face shining bright at me.
One day soon there'll be nothing left of you and me.

Two coffins for sleep.

Two coffins for sleep.

All the things I have yet to lose will someday be gone too.
Back into annihilation.
All things will fade, maybe it's better off that way.
I wish you'd stay with me.

How lucky I ever was to see
the way that you smiled at me.
Your little moon face shining bright at me.
One day soon there'll be nothing left of you and me.

Two coffins for sleep.

Two coffins for sleep.

How lucky I ever was to see
the way that you smiled at me.
Your little moon face shining bright at me.
One day soon there'll be nothing left of you and me.

Two coffins for sleep.

Two coffins for sleep.
