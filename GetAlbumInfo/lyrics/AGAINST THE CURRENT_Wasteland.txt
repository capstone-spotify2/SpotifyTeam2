Have I lost my mind?
Is this paradise?
Or a darker side?
Candy coated lips
You're the sweetest kiss
But a bad trip

Changing faces
Know the name but I just can't place it
Slurring phrases
Took a step but I can't retrace it
You tell me, "Take this"
But I don't wanna wake up in your

Wasteland
Your wasteland
(I don't wanna wake up in your)
Wasteland
Your wasteland
(No, I don't wanna wake up in your)

Twisted fantasy
In your ecstasy
You're no good for me
Just behind the wall
It's not a dream at all
It's a free fall

Changing faces
Know the name but I just can't place it
Slurring phrases
Took a step but I can't retrace it
You tell me, "Take this"
But I don't wanna wake up in your

Wasteland
Your wasteland
(I don't wanna wake up in your)
Wasteland
Your wasteland
(No, I don't wanna wake up in your)

I don't wanna wake up in your

Changing faces
Slurring phrases
Nothing changes
In your waste-
I don't wanna wake up in your

Wasteland

(No, I don't wanna wake up in your wasteland)
