Oh come away from the day, here I stay 
Living on the bottom of the sea 
Down metal snake corridors steely grey 
Engines hum for nobody but me 
No sound comes from the sea above me 
No messages crackles through the radio leads 
They'll never know, never no never 
How strange life in dark water can be 

Oh mariners spare a thought when you pass 
Those who live the submarine life 
Far in the deep sonar eyes never sleep 
Hiding like a shadow in the night 
Jet planes nose through the clouds above me 
They look for radar traces of me to see 
They'll never know, never no never 
How strange life in dark water can be 

Wonder what the stars look like 
Coming out tonight 
Tell my girl she must be strong 
She sits and waits all night long 
Just looking for a better day 
She'll have to find another way to go 

No memory, tell me what's wrong with me 
Why am I alone here with no rest 
And now the name of the ship's not the same 
How long has it been "Marie Celeste?" 
Now there's nobody from the crew left 
Five hundred years supply of food just for me 

They'll never know, never no never 
How strange life in dark water can be
