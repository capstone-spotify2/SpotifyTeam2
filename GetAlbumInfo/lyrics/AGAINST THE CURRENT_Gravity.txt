Do you remember feeling invincible?
When there was trouble it was us against the world
We kept running, running through the night
Chasing the sun 'til anything felt right

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, you were my gravity
Ooooh, you were my gravity

You left me out there with no one but myself
In an open field for the lightning to strike me down
I was the moon, you were the sun
I can't seem to shine now that you're gone
Now I'm out of orbit cause you left without warning
Are you somewhere better now?

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, you were my gravity
Ooooh, you were my gravity

When you went away, thought I'd never be the same
Would the nightmare ever end?
If I could do it again I wouldn't change a thing 'cause it's made me who I am

And now I'm shattering

Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, now my world is shattering
Ooooh, you were my gravity
