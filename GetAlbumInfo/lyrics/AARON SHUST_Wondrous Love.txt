That you would leave Your throne
And make this world Your home
Forsaking majesty
Embracing mundane
And all of its shame

You walked our dusty streets
Healing a world in need
You looked into the eyes
Of sinners like me
Setting us free

What wondrous love is this
What wondrous love is this
That You would lay aside Your glory for my soul
What wondrous love is this
What wondrous love is this
That You would lay down Your life for my soul

Enduring agony
You bore the cross for me
Betrayed by those You love
You took all our blame
Bearing our pain

They nailed Your feet
They nailed Your hands
You are the God
Who understands
You know rejection
Loss and grief
You loved a world
That nailed You to a tree
