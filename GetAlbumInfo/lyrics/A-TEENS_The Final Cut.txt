How many times
Do we have to talk it over
(Yeah)
How many times
Before we understand
All the things we should have done
All the things we never did
(What, Oh)

I read the signs, baby
Each and every day
You read the signs
But yet you stayed
All the things we should have done
Where and when did it go wrong
(Tell me)
How could we go wrong

I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
We gotta understand that it's time to let it go
Holding on to yesterday, it will never be the same
But now it's time to make
The final cut
The final cut
The final cut
(Burn)

So many things
That we always took for granted
So many years down the drained
Looking back on my life
When you were always on my mind
(On my mind)
All the things we should have done
Where and when did it go wrong
How could we go wrong
(Ah, ah)

I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
We gotta understand that it's time to let it go
Holding on to yesterday, it will never be the same
But now it's time to make
The final cut
The final cut

We grew up together
Built our dreams together
Now it's gone
We made plans forever
Nothing lasts forever
Time to move on
All the things we should have done
Where and when did it go wrong
How could we go wrong

I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
We gotta understand that it's time to let it go
(Let it go)
Holding on to yesterday, it will never be the same
(Yesterday)
Let's make the final cut
(Aaaaaa)
I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
We gotta understand that it's time to let it go
(Final cut, the final cut)
Holding on to yesterday, it will never be the same
But now it's time to make
The final cut
