<i>[VERSE 1]</i>

IN THIS LIFE OF UNCERTAINTY
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL NEED
SOMEONE TO FACE YOU, WITH NO DISGUISE
IN YOU THERES A REMEDY
THAT MAKES EVERYDAY SEEM TROUBLE FREE
NO DISTANCE AND NO DEVICE

<i>[BRIDGE 1]</i>

'COS YOU HEAR THE WORDS
WHEN NO ONE UNDERSTANDS

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

WHEN MY WORLD HAS COME UNDONE
AND I'VE LOST MY SETTING SUN
WHEN ALL I SEE ARE CLOUDS
YOU'RE STILL AROUND
WHEN I FALL INTO A TEAR
INSPIRATIONS DISAPPEAR
YOU CLEAR AWAY THAT DOUBT
'COS YOU'RE STILL, YOU'RE STILL AROUND

<i>[VERSE 2]</i>

NOW I'VE STUMBLED ON UNCERTAINTY
NEVER THOUGHT THIS COULD EVER BE
NO CONTRADICTIONS LEFT INSIDE
WHEN I FEEL THE RAIN COME MY WAY
YOU GIVE ME SUN, YOU'RE MY BRIGHTER DAY
INTUITION'S TELLING ME TO STAY

<i>[BRIDGE 2]</i>

'COS YOU HOLD THE WORDS WHEN NOTHINGS LEFT TO SAY
<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[VERSE 3]</i>

IN THIS LIFE OF UNCERTAINTY
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL NEED
SOMEONE TO FACE YOU, WITH NO DISGUISE
IN YOU THERES A REMEDY
THAT MAKES EVERYDAY SEEM TROUBLE FREE
NO DISTANCE AND NO DEVICE

<i>[BRIDGE 3]</i>

'COS YOU HOLD THE WORDS
WHEN NOTHINGS LEFT TO SAY

<i>[CHORUS REPEAT X 2]</i>
