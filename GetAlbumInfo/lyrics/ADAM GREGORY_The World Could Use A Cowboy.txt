There are fences that need to be mended 
There's a stray cut off from the herd 
That needs to be defended By a lonely campfire
Underneath the stars He sings his sad songs
And strums his guitar I tell you what the world could use
Is a little John Wayne kind of attitude

The world could use a cowboy right about now
Run those bad guys right out of town
Round 'em up and hunt 'em down 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy...

There's a stallion that won't be broken 
All the town folk need to hear 
A word of courage spoken 
From New York City to Atlanta G.A. 
From Edmonton to Californ-ia 
I tell you what the world could use 
Is Roy Rogers and Trigger too...

The world could use a cowboy right about now
Run those bad guys right out of town 
A bronkin' buck, you can't keep down 

The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy... 
I tell you what the world could use 

Is the cavalry riding to the rescue 
YEAH, I tell you what the world could use 
Is a little John Wayne kind of attitude 

The world could use a cowboy, 
the world could use a cowboy, yeah 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Run those bad guys right out of town 
Put your hands up, lay your weapons down 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Rides off into the west when the sun goes down 
He tips his hat I When the ladies come 'round 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy...
