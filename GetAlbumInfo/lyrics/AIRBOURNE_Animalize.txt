Stranded in Nevada under a neon sky
Home of the star spangled gambler
Change your life with a roll of the dice

Where the oldest profession
And love for lust
Are still the number one obsession
Married at dawn divorced by dusk

Line 'em up
Throw 'em down
Whatever we do is gonna stay in this town

Whenever I want
Animalize me
Whenever I need
Animalize me
Everything that I crave
Animalize me
What money can't buy me
You never deny me
You animalize me

Watch Caesar and Satan
Do the Cirque Du Sin
Viva las wages
The poor man lose and the rich man win

Line 'em up
Throw 'em down
Whatever we do is gonna stay in this town

Whenever I want
Animalize me
Whenever I need
Animalize me
Everything that I crave
Animalize me
Every sin every vice
From the drink to the dice

Whenever I want
Animalize me
Whenever I need
Animalize me
Everything that I crave
Animalize me
What money can't buy me
You never deny me
You animalize me

Yeah, alright, I 'm gonna,
I'm gonna match those cherries
I'm gonna get triple cherries
Hey baby stick this in you slot!

Whenever I want
Animalize me
Whenever I need
Animalize me
Everything that I crave
Animalize me 
Every sin every vice
From the drink to the dice

Whenever I want
Animalize me
Whenever I need
Animalize me
Everything that I crave
Animalize me
What money can't buy me 
You never deny me
You animalise me
