I wanna have it all
Happiness and love all around
Always wanted finer things
But all the money brings is me down

Gonna walk around in your head
It's time to start moving
And do what you said
Gonna walk around in your head
Don't know where you're going
But you know where you stand

'Cause everybody walks alone
When they feel like they don't belong
If only you try, then you can have it all
But you need to let go, of everything you know
If you live and let die, then you will have it all

Some people let it in
While lovers let the moments pass them by
Oh why
And there's never any question
It was always right in front of your eyes
Oh why

I'm gonna walk around in your head
You know where you're going
And you know where you stand

'Cause everybody walks alone
When they feel like they don't belong
If only you try, then you can have it all
But you need to let go, of everything you know
If you live and let die, then you will have it all

'Cause everybody walks alone
When they feel like they don't belong
If only you try, then you can have it all
But you need to let go, of everything you know
If you live and let die, then you will have it all

And I'll wait for you now
While you turn things around
I will wait for you now
To be ready, when you are

'Cause everybody walks alone
When they feel like they don't belong
If only you try, then you can have it all
But you need to let go, of everything you know
If you live and let die, then you will have it all
