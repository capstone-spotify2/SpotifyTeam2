Shadows dance around me as I race alone
I will never rest until she's in my arms
So close and yet so far away...
A simple kiss to bring her back, to make this story end

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem
Come and claim your queen!

The wild beasts are ravenous, they will soon devour you
Dark howls echo bitter cries but they fall upon deaf ears

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem
Come and claim your queen!

You're pathetic! What good do you do?!?
She had faith in me, I was her only escape
A most deep and subtle poison welcomes her unblinking eyes to eternal sleep
If I had shown, she would be mine
Who is the fairest of all? Tell me again! Tell me again! You know its me!
A simple kiss to bring her back, to make this story end

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem
We'll make all your dreams come true, come and claim your queen!
