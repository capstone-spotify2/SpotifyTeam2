And you always try to warn me
Of the pretty girls out there
Now I finally learned my lesson
And she got a story to share.

Don't kiss and tell!
Don't kiss and tell!

Listen son my mama said
Love don't cost a thing.
Happiness is free for all
Just treat it like it's king.
And if you true love leaves one day
Make sure not to go wrong
The girl will laugh all the way
As she waves so long.

Don't kiss and tell!
And you always try to warn me
Don't kiss and tell!
Of the pretty girls out there
Don't kiss and tell!
Now I finally learned my lesson
And she got a story to share.

Some years later I found love,
When it seem to go my way.
The girl is like a fairytale,
I didn't have to pay.
So one day my sweetheart went
Then mama's words came true
Crying with a broken heart
I was left all blue.

Don't kiss and tell!
And you always try to warn me
Don't kiss and tell!
Of the pretty girls out there
Don't kiss and tell!
Now I finally learned my lesson
And she got a story to share.

Love is always
Love is always for sale
Cause someone's willing
Someone's willing to pay

Don't kiss and tell!
And you always try to warn me
Of the pretty girls out there
Now I finally learned my lesson
And she got a story to share.

Don't kiss and tell!
And you always try to warn me
Don't kiss and tell!
Of the pretty girls out there
Don't kiss and tell!
Now I finally learned my lesson
And she got a story to share.
