Free Boosie

Ain't this that shit?
Ain't this that shit?

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Ain't this that shit that we gon ride to?
Ain't this that shit that we get high to?
Ain't this that shit that make you vibe nigga?
Pull out yo stick and wanna slide nigga
I like to call this some real nigga shit
A real nigga on some real nigga shit
A lot of hoes on a real nigga dick
And money never make a real nigga switch

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I say I can't stand no bitch nigga
That goes for you snitch niggas
Can't do no broke boys cus everybody with me they go getters
Say money over these lame hoes, ya'll niggas be cuffin dough
Met the bitch in that same night, I'm a knock down like dominoes
I say oh Lord I'm savin
Fuck ya'll, just pay me
Big bees in my whip, catch a young nigga move saney
I be ridin round with 2 ladies
Pussy nigga you basic

Come and fuck and suck a real nigga dick
All these hoes want a real nigga rich

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I ride for my brother, I'd die for my brother
I'd kill for my mother in case you ain't know
Shoot out 100 then fuckin reload it
I lift up yo spirit like you been promoted
I'm with it, runnin my city
Chasin that money, I get it get it
Came to the ratchet, my bitches said Diddy
I want it, I cop it, you watch what you spendin
Niggas be poundin like I'm pron, tell these hoes to please keep calm
If I die today I'm good
Hope this real shit can live on
Ain't no hoe shit in my blood, know my family is my love
Peace my homeboys and my thugs
Still with the same folk from day one

Boy that's real nigga shit
I'm just tryna get my whole team rich
In a Phantom blowin kush behind the tint
Bumpin Boosie Boo, that badass hit

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Say what you wanna, do what you wanna
I get upset, they attack like piranhas
I don't even like not one of you niggas
Bitch ain't thick, can't even fuck with er
Yea we them niggas with the 20 gold bottle
VIP sec, she put 25 models
Pulled up, yep that's us in the foreign
Huh, ya'll life so boring
Uh, I made a mill off touring
Crib in the hills like motherfuckin Lauren
Rest don't chill but just can't ignore
And that pussy so good, I explore like do it
Smoke one, for the ones lost
RIP to every real nigga we once saw, damn
Where the real niggas went?

They gon lose they motherfuckin in the hood when they hear this
