On your way to God,
Did you think of me?
On your way to heaven,
Did you say "I'll see you again"?

It wasn't me, why wasn't it me?

On your way to to the promised land, did you say
"Oh, she was such a friend"?
Then they took you higher and
I don't know if I can follow...

It wasn't me, why wasn't it me?

On your way, I said to the air,
I don't know if I am strong.
So I climbed to the mountain
And I don't know what I did wrong

And it was just me, just little ole me...
