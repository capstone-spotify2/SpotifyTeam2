Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin
Each victory will help you or some others to win
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue
Look ever to Jesus and He'll carry you through

Just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through

Ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and heal you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus will carry you through

Shun evil companions, bad language disdain
God's name hold in reverence, don't take it in vain
Be thoughtful and honest, kindhearted and true
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through

Oh, ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus, He will carry you through

All I wanna do is ask the Savior to help you
Comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through

I wanna just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
He will carry you through
