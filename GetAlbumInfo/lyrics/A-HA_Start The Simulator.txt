Start the simulator
Controllers, listen up
Whatâs your status, Guidance?
Letâs take it from the top
Coming up on docking
The beginnings of a tear
Clearing the tower
We take the air

Start the simulator
Give your tanks a stir
The bright ejecta blanket
All is still a blur
Switch to Omni Bravo
B bus under volt
Roll right to zero
Steady as she goes

Weâre going to fly so high
Into the rendered sky
Weâre going to be all right
Inside the endless night

Start the simulator
I.S.O. valves are gray
EDS to manual
Translation looks okay
Save it for the splash-down
Things you want undone
Youâre in command now
Your home away from home

Youâre in control now
Now youâre on your own
