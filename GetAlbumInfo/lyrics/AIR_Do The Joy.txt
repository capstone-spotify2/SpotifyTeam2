The world is on the brink
The brink of our extinction
The end of an era
The end of a genre
Do the joy , do, do, do
Do the shouts, do, do, do
Do the cries, do, do, do
Do the smiles, do, do, the smiles
Building a sepulture and fading to the ground
Laughing on our ashes and holding our own lashes
Slaping all the species from all over the seas
Do the joy, do the joy, do the joy, do the joy
Do the shouts, do the shouts, do the shouts, do the shouts
Do the cries, do the cries, do the cries, do the cries
Do the smiles, do the smiles, do the smiles, do the smiles
