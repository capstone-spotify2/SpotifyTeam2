You're standing right in front of me 
With a purpose I can't see
I wish I knew whats on your mind 
But thats a key I'll never find
I wanna know what I did wrong
I really waited for so long 
To be alone with you again
I bet your game will never end

And everybody knows your name
You're driving everyone insane
I saw you flirting with that guy
It made me jealous don't know why
I know I'm not the only one
But when all you said and done
You wonder who your date would be
I wonder, Katherine, why not me?

Tonight is dark and you are gone
Again I'm wondering on my lawn
I guess I'll never know the truth
About the secrets from your youth
And if you played me all those times
I kind of thought that you'll be mine
But when I realize your world
You're just a happy little girl

And everybody knows your name
You're driving everyone insane
I saw you flirting with that guy
It made me jealous don't know why
I know I'm not the only one
But when all you said and done
You wonder who your date would be
I wonder, Katherine, why not me?

Katherine why not me 
(Katherine why not me?)
Katherine why not me 
(Katherine why not me?)

You know I'm glad that you're my friend
I hope this story never ends
But there are times I nearly cry
You make me weak I don't know why
I know I'm not the only one
But If you'd like to have some fun
Wherever you might want to be
Just say Katherine, why not me?

And everybody knows your name
You're driving everyone insane
I saw you flirting with that guy
It made me jealous don't know why
I know I'm not the only one
But when all you said and done
You wonder who your date would be
I wonder, Katherine, why not me?

So Katherine why not me...
