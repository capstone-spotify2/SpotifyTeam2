She could hear them fucking through those thin hotel walls
She heard babies crying, she heard laughter, she heard sirens
Red and blue lights flashing through those cheap hotel drapes
Blood spilled out on the porcelain
The bathtub's overflowing

Paralytic states of dependency
Our waking life's just a living dream
Agitated states of amazement
Never quite the woman that she wanted to be <i>[2x]</i>

Spread out face down on those stained, cheap hotel sheets
She spent the last years of her life running from the boy she used to be
Cut her face wide open, shaved the bone down thin, pumped her lips up exaggerated,
A fucked up kind of feminine

Paralytic states of dependency
Our waking life's just a living dream
Agitated states of amazement
Never quite the woman that she wanted to be <i>[2x]</i>

Night time at the hotel, there was fighting in the hall
Thin chain lock to keep the world out, she held her breath 'til it was gone
Standing naked in front of that hotel bathroom mirror,
In her dysphoria's reflection, she still saw her mother's son.

Paralytic states of dependency
Our waking life's just a living dream
Agitated states of amazement
Never quite the woman that she wanted to be

By the time the ball dropped, it was already over <i>[2x]</i>
No resolutions for the new year beginning tomorrow
