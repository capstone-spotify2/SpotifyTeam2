Oh, I can't believe the time has come,
What can I do, there's no place to run
Hold me close, it's not too much to ask
Help me forget, tonight might be our last
Don't let it pass.

If it's the last time
Let me wrap my love around you
Let me lose you like I found you
Make it feel like paradise.

If it's the last time
There's no danger in the fire
Let it burn and take us higher
Let's give it one more try,
One last time before goodbye.

We've got one more chance to make it right
To share the days, the way we shared our nights
Talkin' was so hard to do
I turned away and kept on hurting you
It can't be true, no....

If it's the last time
Let me wrap my love around you
Let me lose you like I found you
Make it feel like paradise.

If it's the last time
There's no danger in the fire
Let it burn and take us higher
Let's give it one more try
One last time before goodbye.

Let the heartaches fade away
Give them back to yesterday
I need you to stay and hold me,
Touch me,
There must be a way.

If it's the last time
Let me wrap my love around you
Let me lose you like I found you
Make it feel like paradise.

If it's the last time
There's no danger in the fire
Let it burn and take us higher
Let's give it one more try.

No...if it's the last time
Let me wrap my love around you
Let me lose you like I found you
Make it feel like paradise.
