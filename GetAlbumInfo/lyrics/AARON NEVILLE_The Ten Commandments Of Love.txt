(Two) And stand by me all the while
(Three) Take happiness with the heartache
(Four) And go through love wearing a smile
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
Oh love

(Five) Thou shalt always have faith in me
In everything I say and do
(Six) Love with all your heart and soul
Until our life on earth is through
Oh how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love

Love, oh sweet love
It's oh, oh so grand
You will find since the beginning of time
It has proved throughout all the land

(Seven) Come to me when I am lonely
(Eight) Kiss me when you hold me tight
(Nine) Treat me sweet and gentle
(Ten) When we say good night
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
Oh, love
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
<i>[Spoken]</i> the ten commandments of love
