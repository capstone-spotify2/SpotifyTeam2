So maybe I wasn't
That good a friend
But you were one of us
And I will wonder
Just like anyone
If there was something
Else I could've done

So maybe it's true that
Your cry for help
Was oh, so very faint
But still I heard
And knew something was wrong
Just nothing you could put your finger on
And I will wonder
Just like anyone
Just like anyone
