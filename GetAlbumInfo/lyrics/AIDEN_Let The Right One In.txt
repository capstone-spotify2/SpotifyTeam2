It`s not the knife you bleed on.
It`s not the cancer in your bones.
It`s not the sunrise choking.
It`s not the blood red moon alone.
It`s not the way you look dead.
It`s not the silent season.
It`s not the suffer intense.
It`s not the life you feed on.

(It`s the way the night falls into feeling grey)

Empire, I was built around your heart.
(Hey!, Hey!)
Let the right one in. 

It`s not the ghost you kill with.
It`s not the yellow eyes you crush.
It`s not your failing senses.
It`s not the barrel of this gun.

(It`s the way the night falls into feeling grey)

Empire, I was built around your heart.
(Hey!, Hey!)
Let the right one in.

Let the right one in.

Empire.... let the right one in.

(It`s the way the night falls into feeling grey)

Empire, I was built around your heart.
(Hey!, Hey!)
Let the right one in.
