Always on the run
Where you are going, what you are doing
Looking just for fun
Love the twilight, love the dark

Rats - are all around
And I am waiting for a head
Take what you want
And if you need it take it now
Guess it will be just alright

I'm living for tonite - tonite
Living for tonite - tonite

Working out my way
Find some ramp-rats, find some victims
Bad games all night long
We need to hid it just for fun

Games - we shouldn't play
And if you need some help - just wait
I'm going out into the dark
Guess it will be just alright

I'm living for tonite - tonite
Living for tonite - tonite

Gimme your body
Take what you want
Can't wait anymore

I'm living for tonite - living for tonite
Tonite - living for tonite
Tonite - living for tonite
Tonite - I'm living, living for tonite
