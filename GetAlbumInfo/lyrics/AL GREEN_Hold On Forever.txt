Hold on forever, hold on forever
'Til I can get everything in place
Well, hold on forever, hold on forever
'Til I can see my shapeless face

I've got to smile on forever
Smile 'cause there's a me for you to joy
That's a smile, smile, smile
Well, this song is for every girl and boy

I've had good times, I've had bad times
I haven't had enough
I have my ups and down, I've been turned around
I haven't given up

Don't you know everybody have to walk the line?
I have had to do my time, it's a shame my song's for free
And everybody knows that's the way it goes
The Lord is watching over me

I think I really better hold on forever, hold on forever
'Cause there's a smile I'd like to wear
I'll hold on forever, hold on forever
'Cause, 'cause there's some joy I've got to share

I wanna thank somebody <i>[?]</i>
That may keep on holding on
That may keep on holding on <i>[?]</i>
I keep holding on, I keep holding on

I keep on holding on, I keep seeing face
Nothing in the world can take this face
I, I, I keep holding, I'm holding
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding
