I was a loser then,
But I'm a winner now.
I'd do it all again,
'Cause now I know how.
How everything in life comes down to this, at last:
Surviving, and living,
Determined not to give in.

And I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.
My mind is slowly waking,
And my heart has ceased its aching.
I'm still alive.

I took so many blows.
(Took so many blows.)
I cried a sea of tears.
And only heaven knows
How I could stand the fears.
I think of all the nights I lay alone, and scared,
All shattered, and crying,
And thinking I was dying.

But I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.
My mind is slowly waking,
And my heart has ceased its aching.
I'm still alive.

Yes I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.
My mind is slowly waking,
And my heart has ceased its aching.
I'm still alive.
I'm still alive.
I'm still alive.
