As the world turns slowly
You're always on my mind
As a friend you're always there for me
Forever by my side
I hear you whisper my name
I can never feel alone
I says deep down in my heart
I don't want us to part
And I want to take you home

Oh, just take my hand
Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That your love flows from the fountain of love, 
Love, love

Let love surround us
And this feeling of the night, yeah
If there is a doubt in your mind
I will make it alright, hmmm
I've never felt like this before
It's only you that I adore
I says deep down in my heart
I don't want us to part
And I want to take you home

Oh, just take my hand

Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love, 
Love, love

Oh I know, I know
As the world turns slowly
You're always on my mind
As a friend you're always there for me
Forever by my side

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love flows from this fountain of love

If you want the answer now, now , now
Let's drink together from the fountain of love
Oh baby, won't you look in my eyes and realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Why don't you look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love, true love, true love, flows from the fountain of love
Take my hand come on and walk with me
If you look into my eyes then you will realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love
