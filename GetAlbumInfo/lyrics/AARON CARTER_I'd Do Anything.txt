I'd do anything for you 
We've had our good times and bad 
Baby what is sad 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
Now that you're gone ...away 
It's hard for me to say 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
I just want you to know 
That the love I have is real 
But girl I really want to show you how I feel 
I'd do anything 
To be with you again 
Just name the place 
And I will be there, I will be there 
Oh tell me why can't I 
Have the one I love 
Just like the way it used to be 
I miss you all of the time 
When you were mine 
I miss the way it seemed so right 
How could I let the girl I love 
Slip right through my hands 
I can't get you off my mind 
I just want to make you happy 
I want to make you understand 
I need you for my girlfriend 
Until the very end 
Oh I miss holding hands and playing games 
I get chills when I hear your name 'cuz I know 
It'll never be the same 
I'd do anything 
Just to be with you 
I'll tell you that I love you 
If you want me to 
Just call my name 
And I'll be there 
To let you know how much I care 
Oh... baby...
