So much is going on
But you can always come around
Why don't you sit with me for just a little while?
Tell me, what's wrong?

If you just gimme all your love ohh
Gimme all you got, babe
Gimme all your love ohh
Bit more

So tell me what you wanna do
You say the world, it doesn't fit with you
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while?
I can only try to make it right

If you just gimme all your love ohh
Gimme all you got, babe
Gimme all your love ohh

Give me all your love
Give me all you got, babe
Give me all your love
