Let the world fall down and see if I care
I see the all pretend but I know who I am
'Cause I work all day and I rock all night
Don't try to stop me unless you're ready to fight

You can knock me down, but I'll still be here in the final round

'Cause I get back up (get up)
One more time, then you knock me down
And get back up (get up)
You can't keep me down

Ah yeah!

You look down on me, I don't look up to you
It's the same old school, give me something new
'Cause you try, try, try to get in my way
But I know what I got and you can't take it away

You can knock me down, but I'll still be here in the final round

'Cause I get back up (get up)
One more time, then you knock me down
And get back up (get up)
Everytime that you knock me down, I get up

That's right
Come on
I'm gonna get back up

You can knock me down, but I'll still be here in the final round

'Cause I get back up (get up)
One more time, then you knock me down
And get back up (get up)
Everytime that you knock me down
'Cause I get back up (get up)
Get back up (get up)
'Cause I get back up (get up)
I get back up

You can't keep me down
