Jesus is a friend of mine

Jesus is a friend of mine
He saved my soul, renewed my mind
Jesus is a friend of mine
Everybody say ah, oop

When I'm weak He makes me strong
He is my shelter in the time of storm
When I'm weak He makes me strong
Everybody say ah, oop

He will never let me down
He is the best thing I've ever found
He will never let me down

A friend of mine

Jesus is a friend of mine
He saved my soul, renewed my mind
Jesus is a friend of mine
Everybody say ah, oop
