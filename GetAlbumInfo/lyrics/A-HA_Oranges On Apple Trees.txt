Oranges on apple trees 
Birds that mate with bumblebees
Oranges on apple trees 
Water comes and water goes 
Where it ends up no one really knows 
Water rises, water falls
Where it comes from no one knows for sure 
It seeps from every pore 

We have seen the rain before 
Not like this - It's flooding every shore 
People come and people go
I can hear their laughter through the door 
But no one's keeping score 
Oranges on apple trees 
Birds that mate with bumblebees
One big happy family 
Endless possibilities 
(yeah and more) 

Oranges and apple trees 
I see your face in front of me
Can't believe what no one else could see
I feel it deep inside of me 
Everything we love shall be released 
And everyone will see 
Oranges on apple trees (for sure) 

I used to be the only one 
Not now since you've come
You and I have seen the signs 
That's why the wind died 
The wind died 

That's why Oranges on apple trees
Birds that mate with bumblebees 
Endless possibilities (now) 
Oranges on apple trees
All the things that we can see
Multi-gender wannabes 
Oranges on apple trees
Birds that mate with bumblebees 
One big happy family 
Endless possibilities (yeah yeah yeah) 
Oranges on apple trees (for sure)
