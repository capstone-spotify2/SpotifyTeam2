No man is perfect in this world but I feel heâs
The perfect man for this girl, yea
Said he loves me he feeds my soul when it's empty
He even puts his foot down when I try to cross the line, yea

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That man (Picks me up when Iâm down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (It's obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)

He may get jealous sometimes but I do too
You should see him my man is so fine
Heâs always got the right words to say
Heâs never let me down one day
And even if things got bad
He would stand up and be a man

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That man (Picks me up when Iâm down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (It's obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)

Youâre my king
And Iâm your queen
Iâll make sure that you know
My love will always grow

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That man (Picks me up when Iâm down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (Its obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)
