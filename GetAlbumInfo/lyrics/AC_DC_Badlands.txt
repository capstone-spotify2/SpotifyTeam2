I'm a pistol packin' man
With a gun in my hand
Lookin' for a woman that'll understand
I like to roll and I like to ride
I'll stop at nothing never take me alive
I'm a man with a fast hand
Lovin' on a last stand
Outlaw quick draw
Evil talkin' bandit man
In the badlands
In the badlands

I got a 45 that'll make you fry
Burn your chassis lassie like the 4th of July
I ride it hard I ride it high
Make love to you till you reach for the sky
I'm a man with a fast hand
Got it on a last stand
Outlaw quick draw
Evil talkin' bandit man
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands

Well I'm guilty
Saddle up my six pack
Ain't gonna back track
My shooter loaded
Come on girl I'm gonna give you a thrill

In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands

In the badlands, looking for a woman
In the badlands, as bad as me
In the badlands, gonna take her with me
In the badlands
Yeah
