Everybody wants in different directions
The whole world's running to each his own
It's a place that justifies it all
And nobody's ever wrong
I guess we got to agree to disagree
Even if we're singing the same song
You can't try to change a life that don't want to be changed
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey 

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
And we'll be alright
Alright

Everybody longs for success, whatever that is
The whole world's longing for each his own
It's a place where the truth stays in the light
Cause nobody ever lies
And we follow our hearts into the night
Wake up thankful to be alive
You can't try to save a life that don't want to be saved
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
We'll be alright
Alright

I am who I am
And you are who you are
I could wish on a cloud
And you could wish on a star
Still we'll be alright

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
We'll be alright
Alright
