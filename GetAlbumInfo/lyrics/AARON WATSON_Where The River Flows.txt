Well I was born on the banks of a river
Cool and clear runnin' deep and wide
So I put my feet in the rushin' water
And felt the freedom runnin' deep inside

And though I wander through the darkened valley
Well it was there to lead me home
Whenever I needed a little peaceful healin'
Well you can find me where the river flows

Those sheltered days are so far behind me
And now I travel unchartered ground
My steps may lead me through the barren desert
But I won't lose sight of where I am bound

My feet grow weary through life's journey
Still there's a place where I can go
Whenever I'm needin' a little peaceful healin'
You can find me where the river flows

Now if you're searchin' for the river
Listen close and you can hear it runnin' on and on

When I reach the end of this road I've taken
And I feel cold wind down in my bones
Well I'll be needin' a little peaceful healin'
And you will find me where the river flows

And though I wander through the darkened valley
It's always there to lead me home
Whenever I'm needin' a little peaceful healin'
Yes, you will find me where the river flows
Yes, you will find me where the river flows
