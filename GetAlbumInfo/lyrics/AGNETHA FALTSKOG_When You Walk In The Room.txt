EVERYTIME... 
I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitar playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Baby it's a dream come true (dream come true)
Standin' right alongside of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stand and stare
I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just anytime that someone speaks your name
Oh, the trumpets sounds and I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room
