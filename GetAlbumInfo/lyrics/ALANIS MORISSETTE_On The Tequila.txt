Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 

My friends and I meet hours before 
We make some home made pizza 
We do some funny bits back and forth 
My knees buckle I laugh so hard 

We might end three sheets to wind 
And who knows where we'll wind up 
All I know is thereâs a car waiting 
And weâll figure that out after 

I have to keep my eye on my old friend from high school 
Weâve known each other for the longest time 
She has trouble with her dance so to speak 
She can hoist a really good kick in the butt when she's excited 
She doesnât do it so much anymore 
'Cuz weâre all on to her 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then thereâs my other pretty friend from high school 
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her 
and now i've reeled it in 
Itâll be interesting to see how much sheâs done as well 

Then thereâs my friend from Chigago 
God do I love all people from Chicago 
All ready to light up the barbeque 
And be harping on debauchery 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then thereâs my Canadian friend 
What a fabulous mom sheâs become 
Sheâs been tortured in this sense 
for the last many of months for obvious reasons 

She was like "hey where was this part of you when I wasnât pregnant" 
I laughed and did a shot in her honor 
As I conversed with her belly 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh 
Bestest friends on Tequila oh 

Then thereâs my Cupid friend 
She sure knows how to dress that one 
Sheâs a wise and worldly girl 
But you gotta watch that medication 

My favorite beverage is taken to a whole other level on it 
Iâm not worried about it or Iâll coast around the room 
While I trust sheâll temper 

My brother came to visit me 
And now heâs used to hanging with me and cracking up 
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance 
No idea about how manipulative Iâve become 
I would seruptitiously put it in front of him without him asking 
In a pretty little shot glass 
His smirk and cackle would only agg me on 

Bring on the Tequila oh 
On fire on Tequila oh 
Mostest most on Tequila oh
