Do you remember me?
'Cuz I remember you
Just a few short years
You told me you'd stay here
But now I see the truth

It hasn't felt like home
Since you left us alone
Our living room feels cold
But I won't give up hope
'Cuz maybe you'll come home

But tell me why you don't put up a fight
You might've left but you're stuck in my mind
Playing in my head almost every night
I wasn't prepared for our last goodbye

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm sorry too
Maybe I'm too much worst
So just ignore my hurt
'Cuz what does hurting do

And was it enough?
I thought you could love
I may be just a girl
But wanna know your world
Cuz you're the one I want

But tell me why you don't put up a fight
You might've left but you're stuck in my mind
Playing in my head almost every night
I wasn't prepared for our last goodbye

Oooh oh oooh 
Waiting for you call
For anything at all
Maybe you'll say you're sorry
But if not, don't worry
I can still be strong

Tell me why you don't put up a fight
You might've left but you're stuck in my mind
Playing in my head almost every night
I wasn't prepared for our last goodbye
