Dead and lost with tired faces, antiquated passion laid to rest
Wake up!
No smiles for the memories we have, rotting with the corpses of our past
Please wake up!
Here we stand left in the dark! Kick back!
Here we are screaming for help! Strike back!
Do you think that we have a fighting chance?
Shall we dance on the wings of hope and together fly through the sky?
We are not living for this! I will take back what is ours!

Stand up coward!
Dear God, scream it like you mean it!
No time to rest for sleep beckons the weak

Darling, please understand and listen, this is insane
This canât be it, I donât think I am ready for goodbyes
If you leave, if we try to finish what we began
I donât think I can bring you back
So kiss me before you go and whisper three sweet words

There must be something that I missed, pieces drift away
I wish I could think outside of the box now, solve the riddle
no stone will be left unturned
with God as my witness I will find a way
to slow, to beat the wheels of time
I wake up beside you and we smile, oh foolishness

Stand up coward!
Dear God, scream it like you mean it!
No time to rest for sleep beckons the weak

Darling, please understand and listen, this is insane
This canât be it, I donât think I am ready for goodbyes
If you leave, if we try to finish what we began
I donât think I can bring you back
So kiss me before you go and whisper three sweet words

Shatter the hourglass
Dissect the universe, tear through reality, rearrange the stars above

Open your eyes and gaze the skies above a world that we have made
Blood, sweat, and tears, ions and years
Weâre building a utopia

Yet I still remain in this cursed place
So far from my dreams
This must be hell! I will escape!
Burn it to the ground
Tear it brick from brick
Till thereâs nothing left but a hole in the sky

Darling, please understand and listen, this is insane
This canât be it, I donât think I am ready for goodbyes
If you leave, if we try to finish what we began
I donât think I can bring you back
So kiss me before you go and whisper three sweet words

Shatter the hourglass
Dissect the universe, tear through reality, rearrange the stars above
