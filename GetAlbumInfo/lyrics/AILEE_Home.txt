<i>[English Translation:]</i>

Hello, how are you these days?
I guess you're doing well
I guess I'm curious, boy
Hello
Don't you miss me?
Even if it's not as much
As me missing you

You said that you wouldn't regret
With such confidence
Lies, stop lying
You need me you need me

If I were to be honest
I'm still waiting for you
As I'm trapped alone in my room
I remember

I miss you but why aren't you coming
Home home
Words you used to say when you called
Home home

I'm coming home
Coming home yeah
I'll run to you
I'm coming home
All alone
But now I'm all alone

I know
That I'm being a fool
I know but I can't help it
Lies, it isn't a lie
Believe me believe me yeah

The future we dreamed of
I hope you don't forget either
As I'm trapped alone in my room
I remember

I miss you but why aren't you coming
Home home
Words you used to say when you called
Home home

I'm coming home
Coming home yeah
I'll run to you
I'm coming home
All alone
But now I'm all alone

No matter how much I look around
There isn't another guy like you
You used to hold my hand so tightly
Don't let go of it

I used to say I wouldn't regret
Don't look back
And just let go
So confidently
I don't want to be alone
I'm such a fool
But I can't help it
You're my man, you hold onto me
I'm forever your girl
Yes tell me honestly
You still want me too
Don't be shy
I miss you too so
Come closer
We break up to make up
I wake up and hate
That you gone for so long
No matter how much you look around
There isn't another girl like me
You need me come home

I miss you but why aren't you coming
Home home
It's time you come home but why aren't you coming
Home home
(Why aren't you coming babe)

Where are you, where are you yeah
I'll run to you
Where are you, I'm alone
Our happy home
