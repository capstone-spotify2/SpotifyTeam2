Well, love's got a hold on me, won't let go;
'cause it's the real thing ba-by,
I just want you to know
That I love you all the way,
More and more each day.

I love to hear you say, 'Well, loves got a hold of me too,
I know it's true; I get that funny feeling just from being close to you.
When I listen to your heart-beat
Not another sound so sweet,
Please hold my hand.'

And we climbed the highest mountain
And we sailed the seven seas,
And nobody was with us
At the top of the world in love
And runnin' free.

'Baby, I'm on fire,
And it feels so good
To have this warm desire
Like a woman should who's really got
Someone to make love to.
I'll stay right here forever with you.'

Well, I'll be right here beside you till the end,
And kiss your eyes and cast away your troubles to the wind,
And love you for all my life,
And take you for my wife,
Please hold my hand.

And we climbed the highest mountain
And we sailed the seven seas,
And nobody was with us
At the top of the world in love
And runnin' free.

I can see the love light shinin'
Like a rainbow in your eyes.
Listen to your heartbeat.
Ain't nobody here with us,
Listen to your heartbeat,
Ain't nobody here with us.
Listen to your heartbeat,
Ain't nobody here with us.
