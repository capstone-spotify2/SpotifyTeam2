Over here, over there
People are waiting
On the wings of a prayer
Their hopes are fading
Well I know He can be
Everything for You
Gotta say what I feel
And you know it sure feels good
To know that He is there for me

I know that He loves me
I know that He saved me
It sure feels good
I gotta peace of mind
That you can't deny
When He turned my life around
Oh I can promise
It ain't no lie
He sent me here just to testify
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels good

Another day, another way
People are dying
But I know there are those
That can stop this crying
You can say what you will
I won't stop moving
Tell me this, tell me that
Don't plan on losing
'Cause this thing sure feels good

Tell you He loves me
Oh that He moves me
Sure feels good
I gotta love that's divine
That you can't find
Unless your hand is wrapped up in mine
Oh I got a feeling each and every day
This walk gets only sweeter
Day by day
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels mighty good
Haven't you heard
Don't you know, don't you know
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute
Won't you stop a while
There may be something here
That can make you smile
If it feels good
The way it's supposed to feel
Then you should know
That this love is real
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good
Got a peace of mind
That I can't deny
Turned my life around
I can promise, it ain't no lie
He sent me here
Just to testify
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good
