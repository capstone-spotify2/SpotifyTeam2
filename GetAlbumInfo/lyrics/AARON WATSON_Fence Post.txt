Now this is a true story, for the most part, that occurred on the top floor
Of this big wig record executive's office in Nashville, Tennessee
Now understand I'm not poking any fun or disrespecting anybody
God knows I love country music with all my hear and soul
And I love the Grand Ole Opry

But I do have a problem with someone who can't even play a D chord on a guitar
Telling someone with a dream that they won't get far
So this song is dedicated to all those underdogs like me out there runnin' around
Don't get discouraged if you have a dream, don't be afraid to chase it down
This is how it goes

He said "Son don't get offended by what I'm about to say
I can see you have a passion for the songs you write and play
But you lack what we all call commercial appeal
And you just don't have what it takes to make it here in Nashville"
Ouch

Well my heart felt like a train wreck but I wore a smile on my face
I said, "Thank you for your time sir," I put my guitar back in it's case
Our little conversation was like a revelation redirecting my dreams
Cause God knows I'd never sell my soul to rock n' roll or rap or wear those tight skinny jeans

Cause you know I'd rather sing my own songs than be a puppet on a string
I wear what I wanna wear, I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee

So I loaded up my ol' pick up truck, I drove back home to Amarillo
Got a gig off old route 66 at this ballroom called The Armadillo
And for the first 1000 show or so not a soul showed up
I thought about quitting every other day but I just kept on kicking that cup

Yeah I kept kicking that can surrounded by blood, sweat and beers
And wouldn't you know I became an overnight sensation in just over ten years
And now I'm packing out all the dancehalls and the rodeos every night
I got a pretty wife, a ranch, a band, a bus, a boat, I'd say I'm doing alright

And you know I'd rather sing my own songs than be a puppet on a string
I wear what I wanna wear, I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee

Well wouldn't you know that ol' record man showed up one night at this honky tonking bar
After my show he said, "Son I believe you might be the next big country star"
He said, "We like how you keep it raw, we like how your keeping it real
And I think you may just have what we all like to call commercial appeal"
Huh, ain't that somethin', well sir

I'd rather sing my own songs than be a puppet on a string
I wear what I wanna wear, I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee

God bless Tennessee
But I'd rather be just an old fence post in Texas

Than to sell my soul to rock n' roll or rap or wear those tight fittin' skinny jeans
