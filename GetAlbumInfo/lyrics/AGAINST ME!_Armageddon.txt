One night we lay beside each other, so close to a sweat 
with two fans circling overhead, we sleep on borrowed time 
and the traffic lights direct empty roads, the stars can't break the city sky 
but they still try despite what they know is already true 
and tomorrow we'll take aim, just like a storm waiting for a calm 
i can feel everything coming in my chest, my heart's already pounding 
my head's on far-off highways, sixteen years old, on a road that never ends 
might drive into something that looks like a sunset, 
and it lasts forever, and i never look back 
from hoboken to l.a. 
from portland to gainesville 
from the great plains to niagara 
route 66 straight to california 
electric lights carry the night 
we move in 4/4 time 
our feet on wheels and in the sky 
yes we're going cause we'd die if we stayed here 
and those dying dreams will carry what's good, and real, and pure 
and the rest can burn in hell 
and for the four-year-old girl found dead in a dumpster 
shot by her mother, her eulogy, 
the sound of construction through head-to-head traffic 
today is just another day. 
and me and my friends are just growing into the drunks 
and the liars that we've always hated 
every shortcoming has trapped us, every mistake is now our own infinite failure
so we steal every chance we get 
every advantage is taken when no one's looking 
we hide behind closed doors, and we don't stop till 
we are the people we've decided we should be 
i wanna be a shot heard round the world, fucking unstoppable 
this distance is not something we'll regret 
between here, and now, and today, and forever, and days after that till the very end
