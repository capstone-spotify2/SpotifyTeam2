<i>[Chorus]</i>
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 

As I sit back and think 'bout what to do next 
I start to reminisce about my life and shit 
Like how I came from the streets 
Was raised by the streets 
That's why I give love and I'll die for the streets 
I really can't help how I feel 
And I can give two fucks to know how to deal 
With the pain and anger, stress, emotions 
I just roll a blunt, light it up and start smokin' 
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' it 
And start blastin' at phones and shit 
That's why I'm fully equipped 
with the hollowtip, so bitches don't slip 

I can't help all the things I do 
(I can't help it!) 
I gotta feelin' neither can you 
(I can't help it!) 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 

I can't help if I'm crazy, or just insane 
I can't help if the words I speak cause pain 
Ya gotta..keep ya cool, and say (I CAN'T HELP IT!) 
Rearrange, time will change (FUCK IT!!) 
Deal with it, face ya'self 
I can't help if my mind's taking o-over 
Brace ya'self, there's no time left 
my soul is gettin' clooo-ser 
Stay away if you can't stand the heat 
Cause when the mike's off, I'm corruptin' the streets 
Brown paper bag wrapped around my drink 
Eyes wide open, I can't help to blink 
Why do you talk that way? 
Say all those things you say 
Those rumors you create, I bet you can't help it 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 

I said I couldn't help it, so leave me alone 
Why you askin'? Quit harrassin'! 
Too paranoid to pick up the phone 
Home alone all day dustin' off the chrome 
What am I supposed to do? 
When everytime I turn around I got to deal with fools 
It's like I gotta bend all the rules 
to try to take what's mine even if I lose 
Why you never make it to work on time? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why you smoke all the weed if you knew it was mine? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why you always start shit right before you leave? 
(I can't help it!) 
I guess fuckin' up comes naturally? 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 

<i>[Repeat x2]</i>
It's ain't my fault that I was raised this way 
Never meant to cause you pain 
Only thing that I could say is 
I apologize!!!
