Yesterday, you left Brazil and went
away to see the world.
Looking for a distant beach,
a different shore-a faster whirl.
Thinking that your hearts desire
Hungered for some Paris or Berlin.
Caught between the snow and the fire-
Will sweet Carioca love again?

Your superman gonna do the
super-best he can
To free the pearl.
Giving you the superness
that he can do.
Believe me, girl

That everyday your need is higher.
But love is not Chicago or L.A.
Home is where your heart's on fire
And where that restless snowbird melts away.

It's easy, easy-
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.
It's easy,
Let your love ring out
Let my loving in today.

It's easy
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.
Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Settle down,there ain't
no need to run around.
It's really clear
That I'm the man
Who's gonna do the super-best he can
To keep you near.

Everyday your need soars higher.
Love is not Chicago or L.A.
Home is where your heart's on fire.
Can't deny this love is here to stay.

Easy, easy-
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.
Easy-
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Easy, easy, easy.
Easy-
Let your heart ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

It's easy-
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay
