They called us walking corpses
Unholy living dead
They had to lock us up
Put us in their British hell

Make sure your face is clean now
Can't have no dirty dead
All the corpses here are clean, boy
All the Yanks in British hell

I don't wanna be in your London dungeon
I don't wanna be in your British hell
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in hell
Here's hoping you're swell

Well, they called us walking corpses
Unholy living dead
They had to lock us up
Put us in their British hell

I don't wanna be in your London dungeon
I don't wanna be in your British hell
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in hell
Here's hoping you're swell

Make sure your face is clean now
Can't have no dirty dead
All the corpses here are clean, boy
All the Yanks in British hell

I don't wanna be in your London dungeon
I don't wanna be in your British hell
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in hell
Here's hoping you're swell

Here's hoping you're swell
Here's hoping you're swell
