Really touch somebody.
Really, really touch somebody.
With a random act of love.

Everything we do with good intent
Won't ever disappear, it only ripples into habit
Ever deep, cause it's no accident
That you and I are here
And you and I were meant to happen

There's one thing, that I know
That's like a gift unto the giver
And that's a random act of love
Everyday find a cause
And let it flow just like a river
Into a random act of love

An open heart can change the world we know
Into a loving place
Reviving everything that's givin' in it
Every spark, another chance to grow
Let love illuminate
The place where light is dimming

There's one thing, that I know
That's like a gift unto the giver
And that's a random act of love
Everyday find a cause
And let it flow just like a river
Into a random act of love

One simple thing,
can really touch somebody
Make somebody smile inside
What joy it brings,
to really touch somebody
Love's a win-win heart reliever,
As good for the giver as it is the receiver.
Really touch somebody with a random act of love
Really touch somebody with a random act of love

Just one thing I know,
That's a gift to the giver
Just one thing I know,
Just, let it flow like a river
Just one thing I know,
Making life even better
One thing that I know,
Flip your script

One thing that I know of love
Everyday...
