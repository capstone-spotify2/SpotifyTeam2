Give me that old time
Old time lovin'
Give me that old time
Old time lovin', yeah, yeah

It was good they know
Mother and father, yeah
If that makes the no
It's alright for me

What I need is that old time, yeah
Old time feelin'
Better have in me rockin' and reelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Music will make you move your feet
Haven't you seen, yeah
I've been trying to love you, baby
And my arms are free, yeah

But what I need is that old time
Yeah, oh yeah
I don't want you to turn your back on your friends
But I really need that old time, yeah

I know there are times
When I might neglect you, baby
I want you to come on home
I want you to come on, yeah

And the only thing I want you to do
Is give me that old, that song that will mean
Sometime your love makes me
Give up the right from the wrong, yeah

I just keep on marching on my way, yeah
