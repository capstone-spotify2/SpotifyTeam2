Stop!
She was banging
But lovin' was cold
Keep it up, it's going
to be a love TKO

Trying to find my direction
Instead of feeling the love
You break it all down into section

<i>[BRIDGE]</i>
Cos I want you baby
And I need you lady
Don't stop acting shady
Take a detour
I'm singing to you lady

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
What's the matter, don't 
you love me (Tell me now)
Don't you really care now
(care about you)
Oh, I'm about to lose 
my mind with your stop sign

I didn't mean to get myself
so involved
Second time around back
round we go
It feels right when I'm next to you
So why you gotta make me so blue

She's telling me
Why
She's thinking that she
needs another
Guy
Somebody that ain't gonna
make her
Cry
Well lady I can be that
But your stop sign's not letting
you see that

Why won't you let me hold you
(Hold you tight)
In my warm embrace
(Sweet embrace)
Why won't you let my love shine
In your stop sign <i>[*2]</i>

Oh no check the flow
You ready with the base
Let's go
My sound abstract
Cut the loop and bring the
beat back
Bounce to the hot new flavour
Turn up the high end on the
system fader
It ain't that I hate you
But I don't wanna know
Yo, I'll see you later

<i>[BRIDGE]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Why won't you let me hold you
(Hold you tight)
In my warm embrace
(Sweet embrace)
Why won't you let my love shine

In your stop sign (I love you baby)
In your stop sign
(I need you baby)
In your stop sign
(I want you baby)
<i>[REPEAT 3 TIMES]</i>
