Has there ever been a moment so good? 
Has there ever been a morning so bright?
You know the whole world looks different
Since I found you 
Before we touched was I really alive? 
Some things you just know for sure
Beyond a shadow of a doubt 
Now I'm too into you
To ever turn my heart around 
Is the sun gonna shine on a rainy night? 
I don't think so
Does once in a lifetime happen twice?
I don't think so
Could I want you any more 
Could anything ever be more right?
Can words explain
How deep
