The sun brought me 
The moon caught me 
The wind fought me
The rain got me 
The road sent me 
For years bent me
The stars overwhelmed me
Time and again

But now I can't see the stars
The star is a thing I can't see
And now I don't feel the same 
To feel is a thing I can't be 

Earth crushed me 
Fame brushed me
The streets hushed me 
As life touched me 
Time placed me 
Events dazed me 
Love saved me
Now and again 

But now there can be no love 
Love is a thing I can't be
And there can be no trust 
Trust is a thing I can't see 
But now there can be no love
Love is a thing that can't be
Now I can't be so strong 
Strong is a thing I can't be 
Time and again 
Time and again

The sun brought me...
