Late nights, everyday is a motherfuckin' party
Too stoned, don't know what I did last night
Hangin' with my niggas gettin' drunk
Smokin' weed &amp; doin' what we want
We live our lives
And ain't no one gon' bring us down
Staying out, sleeping when we can
Cause we don't stop
Going hard, wake up in the morning
Do it all again!
Roll up the Marley, let's get it started
Life of a party!
Let's live for today, we might not be here tomorrow
And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, mooore

Every time I hear the music
I go crazy
Floating there you take me away
Higher we've ever been before
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds

Every time I hit the club
I take my money, I spend it all
Standing on the couch just showing love
Don't give a damn
Don't give a fuck
Float me and take me away
High up in the clouds, never coming down
Somewhere out the space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down
Another hundred grands
As soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep
Mary Jane and them paper planes
Pouring shots, you better take this drink

And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, mooore
They say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, mooore
