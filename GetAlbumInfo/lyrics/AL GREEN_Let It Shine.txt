I know a star that shines
But somewhere in your mind
You're always right on time
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I'm so glad that I'm free, yeah
Lord above would have blessed it on me
I don't mind, won't you let it shine?
Please be kind and let it shine, shine, shine

Well, I know the words to say
Gimme my daily bread, yeah
I never close my eyes, no
Always sleep, they're wise yeah

Now I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, yeah

Eh, I know a star that shine
Is somewhere in your eyes
You're always right on time, yeah
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, shine, yeah, yeah

Sanctify feelings, let it shine
Tales all my in my mind, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine
