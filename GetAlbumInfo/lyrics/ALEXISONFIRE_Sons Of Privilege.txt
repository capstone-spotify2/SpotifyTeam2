America blearing in my ears all day
America, I donât see the glory of your ways
The oldest money flows through a bloodline
Weâll see if your empire stands the test of time
Donât wanna
I donât wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege
Donât wanna
I donât wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege

Sweet lady liberty - 
You are lost, though you are free
And what hides beneath
Canât tell the wolves from the sheep

America, grin and bare the resentment of the world
With all your ugliness and self-worth
Desperate to grease the gears of the hideous machine
The swine, they writhe and praise the infallible regime
Donât wanna
I donât wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege
Donât wanna
I donât wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege

Sweet lady liberty - 
You are lost, though you are free
And what hides beneath
Canât tell the wolves from the sheep

Lost though you are free
In America
Itâs time to justify your pride

Sweet lady liberty - 
You are lost, though you are free
And what hides beneath
Canât tell the wolves from the sheep
