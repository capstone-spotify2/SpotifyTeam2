I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true
How many of us out there
Feel the need to run and look for shelter

I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true
I promised myself
(I promised, I Promised)
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you
(Aaaaaaa)

How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing what was once there
God I know what people say about her
No mistake, who can live without love
I promised myself
(Aaaaaaa)
(I promised, I promised)

In the midnight hour I will wait for you
(For you)
I will wait for you
(I will wait, yeah)
I will wait for you 
(I will wait for you)
In the midnight hour I will wait for you
(Uuuuu)
I will wait for you
(I will wait for you)
I will wait for you
(I will wait for you)

I promised myself
(I promised)
I promised I'd wait for you
(I promised I do, I do)
The midnight hour
(I promised, I promised)
I know you'll shine on through
(I know you'll shine on through)
I promised myself
(I promised, I promised)
I promised the world to you
(I promised the world to you)
I gave you flowers
(Flowers, flowers)
You made my dreams come true
(You made my dreams come true)
