Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping everyday and the cotton is high
Your dad is so rich babe and your mama mighty good looking yeah, yeah
So hush little baby, yeah and donât you, no, no, no, no
Please, please don't cry

One of these mornings we're gonna get up, oh yeah
We're gonna rise up singing, yeah
Weâll spread our wings baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And weâll take to the sky again

But there ain't nothing, nowhere, no, no
There ainât nothing is gonna harm you, touch you, baby, yeah, yeah
You know why 'cause your daddy and your mommy
Is gonna be standing by all, all, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Summertime
