Some people just want to survive
And I don't know about you
But I am alive
Lately it seems that I need a hand
In a fallen world, I just want to stand
What would Jesus do walkin' in my shoes
Workin' at my job and goin' to my school?
And I hear people say, "Jesus is the way"
I believe and that is way I'm asking you

What would Jesus do?
And as we all know
Life can be tough
And all that we need is love sweet love
So where do we go? Well here's what I see
To change my world
I gotta change me

Sometimes choices don't seem black and white
And they can leave you black and blue
What would Jesus do He'd give His life for you
If you follow Him you'll give your life to them
Shine on shine on follow with Jesus
Shine on shine on follow with Jesus
