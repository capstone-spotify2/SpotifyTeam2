Hey little sister what have you done?
Hey little sister who's the only one?
Hey little sister who's your superman?
Hey little sister who's the one you want?
Hey little sister shotgun!

It's a nice day to start again 
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.

Hey little sister who's this girl you're with?
Hey little sister what's your thoughts and wish?
Hey little sister shotgun, oh yeah
Hey little sister who's your superman?
Hey little sister shotgun

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again. (Oww...)

Hey little sister what have you done? (Ohh...)
Hey little sister who's the only one? 
(only one, only one, only one, only one)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long 

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
Come on 

There's nothing fair in this world (There's nothing fair)
There's nothing safe in this world (There's nothing safe)
There's nothing sure in this world 
There's nothing pure in this world
For something safe in this world
Start again

Come on, it's a nice day for a black wedding
Well it's a nice day to start again.
