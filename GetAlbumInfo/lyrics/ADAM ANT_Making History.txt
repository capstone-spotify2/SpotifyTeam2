The murder happy characters have such fun
They murder happy characters one by one
You want a second chance
Out you don't get one

And the good guys hate the bad guys
And the bad guys hate the good guys
And we call this making history
And we call this making history
And we call this making history
And we call this making history

The murder happy characters like to creep
They murder little children while they sleep
They leave you on the floor in a big red heap

And the good guys hate the bad guys
And the bad guys hate the good guys
And we call this making history
And we call this making history
And we call this making history
And we call this making history

The murder happy characters say they know
How to keep the crime rate way down low
"Just nip it in the bud so it can't grow"

And the bad guys hate the good guys
And the good guys hate the bad guys
And we call this making history
