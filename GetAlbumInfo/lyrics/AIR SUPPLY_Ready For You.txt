Painted sands and makeshift hands
Take us round and round
Horizon clear will soon be near
I'm walking on the ground
I've been round the corner
Sinking all the doubts in sight
If you sail across the border
We can float into the night

Oh I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you

Cloudy sky the wind is high
I'm trying to break the spell
But I'll be here when you appear
I see the night as well

A feeling's not a feeling
If you can't believe it's true
I'd sooner be believing
When the ship comes sailing through

I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you

Shifting sea, believe in me
And bring this boat to home
I've waited long my heart is strong
And faithful to its own
My eyes won't start this sleeping
Till they see the face they love
There's so much I've been keeping
And I've kept it long enough

I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
