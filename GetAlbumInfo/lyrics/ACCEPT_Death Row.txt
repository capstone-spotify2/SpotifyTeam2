I'm dead meat - you took away my rights
To be a part of your society
A life-time in prison wouldn't justify
You wanna blow away a sucker - so I have to die

I'm still waiting for the final call
I wanna meet my maker - I'm ready to go
Kill me - kill me - kill me - please, kill me

Give me a reason why you're gonna let me wait
Some kind of punishment before you terminate
You're taking my life for your peace of mind
So let's go - start the show

Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go - death row

I'm a dead man walking so get outta my face
Rather die like a man than rotting this way
I hate you and you hate me
You can come and kiss my dignity
You're taking my life for your peace of mind
So let's go - start the show

Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
I'm ready to go - death row - death row

Your justice is not mine
You punish a crime with another crime
If you need to kill me for your peace of mind
Then let's go - start the show

Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - I'm ready to go - death row
I'm ready to go - death row - death row

Death row - open up 'cause here I come
Death row - knock, knock, knocking
I'm no hero's son
Death row - there's no tears that you can sell
Death row - paid my ticket through the gates of hell

Death row - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - death row
