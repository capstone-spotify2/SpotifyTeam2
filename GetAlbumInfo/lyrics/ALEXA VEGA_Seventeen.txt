(Seventeen!)
Mama drama's got to go, Dad! (Seventeen!)
Nothing's gonna bring her back! (Seventeen!)
Experiment with something living! (Seventeen!...)
And I'm sweeter than sixteen! 

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

(Seventeen!)
I've always longed for true affection (Seventeen!)
But you compare me to a corpse! (Seventeen!)
Stay with the dead, I'm joining the living! (Seventeen!)
'Cause I'm freer than sixteen! 

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

Something's changing... 
I can feel it... 
I'm seventeen now... 
Why can't you see it?
Seventeen and you can't stop me! 
Seventeen and you won't boss me! 
You cannot control me, Father.
Daddy's Girl's a fucking monster!
