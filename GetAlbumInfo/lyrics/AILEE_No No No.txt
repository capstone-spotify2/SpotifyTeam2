<i>[English Translation:]</i>

A guy like you is no no no
A love that's like a joke is no no no
Pretending to be nice, pretending to trust
Oh oh, I'm getting tired now

My fantasy toward you has shattered
The words you said in front of me, the faces you made were all lies
Lonely, my heart is lonely
I fell for your lies so easily

I'm so sorry â saying those fake words
I'm so sorry â and begging, it's no use
I don't like you anymore

A guy like you is no no no
A love that's like a joke is no no no
I don't understand, pretending to be nice, pretending to trust
Why is love like this? Were you never passionate?
Your face when you were meeting some other girl
You tell her that you love her with the same face
Goodbye, goodbye, I'm getting tired now

I'm so upset that my foolish love was deceived
I was deceived by the words that came out of your mouth
Innocently stupid, I'm so stupid
I hope you will meet a girl like you someday

I'm so sorry â saying those fake words
I'm so sorry â and begging, it's no use
I don't like you anymore

A guy like you is no no no
A love that's like a joke is no no no
I don't understand, pretending to be nice, pretending to trust
Why is love like this? Were you never passionate?
Your face when you were meeting some other girl
You tell her that you love her with the same face
Goodbye, goodbye, I'm getting tired now

That day when I first met you â one day
Why was it me?
I guess it's a relief that this happened now
Before I get to know you more, live well, leave me

A guy like you is no no no
A love that's like a joke is no no no
I don't understand, pretending to be nice, pretending to trust
Why is love like this? Were you never passionate?
Your face when you were meeting some other girl
You tell her that you love her with the same face
Goodbye, goodbye, I'm getting tired now
