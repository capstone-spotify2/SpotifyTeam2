I'm a little old fashion
That's the way it is with me
I'm in love with one man
And I know he's feelin' me, oh yes, he is

Things are gettin' kinda serious
When there's no one else around
I ain't into shackin' up
So we gotta lock it down
Gotta put it on paper

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(You know I do)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Put it on)
Put it on paper
(Put it on, what you waitin' on)
(Put it on, what you waitin' on)
(Waitin' on you, waitin' on you)

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(It's not that I don't love you)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Would you do it?)
Put it on paper
(Put it on paper)
(Put it on, what you waitin' on?)
(Put it on, what you waitin' on?)
Whoa

Now-now-now I'm an old school brother
Don't want my business in the street, no, no
What I have for this woman
Is very serious to me

She's so real
Don't wanna bring no shame
I feel so good about her
I wanna change your name

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(You know I love you)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(All I wanna do is)
Put it on paper
(You gotta put it on paper)
Waitin' on you, waitin' on you

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
Put it on paper
(I want you to put it on paper)
(Put it on, put it on, oh)

I've fallen so deeply in love
This I can't deny, yeah
If I'm gonna share my love
I wanna do it, do it right

But wait a minute, wait a minute
I wanna respect you
And love you every, every night
The only way I can do that now and feel good
Is to make you my wife

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Lets put it on)
Put it on paper
(Do it, do it, do it)
(Lets get married today)
(Come on)

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(It's not that I don't love you)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(You know I need you)
Put it on paper
(Said you gotta put it on paper)

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Only way I love you)
Put it on paper
(Put it on paper)

Put it on paper
(I'm hooked on you)
Sign your name
(Put it on paper)
Show me with the paper
Show

There's only one thing I want you to do
(Give me the ring)
(I'll give it to you, babe)
All you gotta put in on paper
(Oh)
(Ah, ah, ah)

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
Put it on paper
(Show me, show me, show me)
Put it on paper
