What do I do to get your attention
What do I do to get this through
Not the cool kids clique
Not the cool fake hits
What do I do to break this silence
What do I do to make the noise
You prefer to hear
demand to hear

I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding
Like an atom bomb
Like a mushroom cloud

What do I do to get your attention
What do I do to get this through
Mobs of idiots do what you're told to do
Get away from superstition
Get away from boogiemen
In the dark night sky
In the dark corner

I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding

I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding
Like an atom bomb
Like a mushroom cloud
