You've got something to say, or so you say to me, then you receive a blank stare.
You've got something to say of importance and gosh, that's really good to hear.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
You've got some S.P. Something to show to me. Well, I have seen it before.
I can't compete, I can't impress you. I guess I'll show you the door.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
I'm proud of you, so proud of you, I'm proud of you, I'm very proud of you.
