I'm waiting
I'm fading fast
I don't know how much longer I can last
I'm calling
Out to you
Come save me
Tell me what am I to do

You're all that I am
And all that I want is you

So take my hand
Pull me through
Deep inside your eyes
I finally found the truth
So hold me close
Don't let me go
Cause a life without you is a world alone
A world alone

Well within me
Your pieces fit
Inside you
The chemicals between us mix
There's no more time
They've got me falling
But you've got me crawling
To prove

You're all that I am
And all that I need is you

So take my hand
Pull me through
Deep inside your eyes
I finally found the truth
So hold me close
Don't let me go
Cause a life without you is a world alone
A world alone

Cause a life without you is a world alone
Cause a life without you is a world alone

So take my hand
Pull me through
Deep inside your eyes
I finally found the truth
So hold me close
Don't let me go
Cause a life without you is a world alone
A world alone

A life without you is a world alone
A life without you is a world alone
