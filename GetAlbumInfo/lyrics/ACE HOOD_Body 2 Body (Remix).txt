<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i>
Ayo baby, tell your friends... to get with my friends
And we can be friends, this the remix

<i>[Hook - Chris Brown]</i>
Baby, you donât have to try to read my mind
Cause I know you wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, Body to body
I donât mean to rush you girl
But We should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

<i>[Ace Hood]</i>
What it do lil' mama, I was thinking we'd get more acquainted
Baby this the G-mix we get heated leave them panties ain't it?
She say her last was super wack his sex was overrated
Gotta give her da good I'm liking da wood and now it's over lady
I give her that pound game, then I slows it up
Nibblin' on ya ear, she love that teasin' stuff
See youse a nasty girl, wit yo fine ass
If it's wet enough I might just need a wine glass
Ha, I'm super freaky, no top on the ghini, no flaw in my diamonds
A house on my pinky, We body 2 body, I keep me a hottie
She kinky as hell, get it off in the lobbies

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Rick Ross]</i>
Body 2 body baby, we gotta do this right
Mean alot more to me, check me out

<i>[Verse]</i>
You only live once, tonight we do it twice
Tell by your handbag that boy don't do you right
Birkin' baby, go merk 'em baby
Got some pocket change too, now ya workin' baby
Got her the bently coup, she call that old news
My tommorrow braxton, doin' shows too
Paid well, like she supposed to, I'm a made man
I'm into old school, no jewels which is ruff for me
But she's so cool, I kiss her carefully
Emergency room, she was there for me
Right back on my feet, I swear I'd never leave

<i>[Hook]</i>
<i>[DJ Khaled interrupts the hook]</i>
THIS IS... REMIX

<i>[Wale]</i>
If heaven had a height then you would be that tall but
Ya see all we got is tonight and I ain't tryna see that far, all we need is convienient love
And I don't mean convo when I say I wanna know how deep you are
Heheh, look

<i>[Verse]</i>
Flower bomb, matter fact she on that bong
You could ask me all you want, but my name ain't oh my god
Passionate in that sack, passionate with this rap
She scratchin' all on my back, jawn like fuckin' up my new tats

Girl work it out, spread it out like work of mouth
You know I'm tryna kill that shit, make sure that urn is out
Now we body to body, go inside and she shakin'
Ain't too fond of relationships though my hobby is relation
I ain't really been trickin' but Ms. body's persuasive

Keep yo mind out my business, I keep yo body in labels
And I'm stuntin' once expired my movements Gordo
My Penn Stated I ain't lyin', Shout out Mr. Paterno

Word up... Wale
