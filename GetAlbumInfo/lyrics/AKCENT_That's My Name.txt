All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name

Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set a fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

<i>[2x]</i>
And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I love your voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

(It's my name, it's my name, it's my name...)

All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name

Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set a fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

<i>[2x]</i>
And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I love your voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

<i>[2x]</i>
And you, you will stay in my heart
As I knew from the start
And you, you will stay in my heart
Never keep you apart
