If a melody is like a memory
You're a long hot summer night symphony
Blaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo
Down FM 109 on my FM Radio

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
You know it's been a while

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style singing

Rebel rebel at the top of our lungs
Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
Everybody said you'd never make it too far
With some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar

You know my crazy dreams,
Were busting at the seams
Just like these old boots and jeans

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going, never going outta style
We're never going outta style

I'll pop my collar do my best James Dean
We'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene
Show me your million dollar Marilyn smile
And I'll show you a love love love

That's never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
The way we love is never going outta style

Never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
We're never going outta style
In my Chevy, parking at the levy,
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
Never going outta style
We're never going outta style
Yeah, we're never going outta style
