Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Brothers for life.

I live my life free of command
These are my friends
It's all I really have

Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Brothers for life.

I never wanted it to be this easy
I never had to try
Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Fuck that,
you're my brothers for life.

We die together
In numbers we stand
These are my brothers
They're all I really have
Born to die, we die together
In numbers we stand
These are my friends
They're all I really have.

I never wanted it to be this easy
I never had to try
Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Fuck that,
You're my brothers for life.
