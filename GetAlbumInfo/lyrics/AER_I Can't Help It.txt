I'm just out of state,
I had to call and say,
I thought of you today,
I can't help it,
I gotta catch this plane,
It's landing in LA,
Remember all those days,
I can't help it

There's a spell and I'm under it, 
I need all of your best so just come down and save me, 
I know you've gotten tired of waiting, 
I just hope you have the patience? 
Cuz I'm always going somewhere, 
but if we could do it all again I wouldn't make any changes, 
now life is looking to be a little bit weightless, 
rearrangement, open up, get your heart racing, on my mind lately,

I'll tell you why, 
cuz you're worth the gold to me, 
the diamonds to me, these trips to me, 
you always see right through me, the globe to me, 
the islands to me, you're everything to me.
I'm just out of state,
I had to call and say,
I thought of you today,
I can't help it,

I gotta catch this plane,
It's landing in LA,
Remember all those days,
I can't help it
So weak to my charm, ya can't stay away, 
reminiscing alone will make you lose control,
fireworks at nightfall, its you I've only ever set my sights on, 
caught a Cartier eyeful, those copper colored doubt thieves, 
bad thinking make a good idea, we're too lit to turn out the lightbulbs, 
when I held you in the parking lot you told me don't be a stranger, 
we gotta stay acquainted, wish I wouldn't end up famous, please try to keep it all painless,

I'll tell you why, 
cuz you're worth the gold to me, 
the diamonds to me, 
these trips to me, 
you always see right through me, 
the globe to me, the islands to me, 
you're everything to me.

Lookin' in to those eyes,
Girl you know your so fine,
What's your plan tonight

Lookin into those eyes,
I ain't gotta think twice,
What's your plan tonight?
I'm just out of state,
I had to call and say,
I thought of you today,
I can't help it,

I gotta catch this plane,
It's landing in LA,
Remember all those days,
I can't help it
