Have you seen the sunset, fade beneath a rain cloud? 
Have you ever chased your dreams away?
Did you ever think that? 
Life was just a highway, a never-ending road of lonely days. 

There are times we cry, and reach out to the sky. 
For the strength we need, to hold our head up high.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All we need have to do now is love one another. 
Sisters and Brothers, can all live as one. 
And all we have to do now is show one another.
We all need each other, to love as on in love.

Have you seen a sunrise, promising you daylight?
When all you need is shelter from the storm. 
Have you ever felt that love was just an island
You can't survive on love all on your own.
There are times when I need to reach inside. 
For the strength I need, to hold my head up high.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.

If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.

<i>[Chorus: Repeat Till End]</i>
