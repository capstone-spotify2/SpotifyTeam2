No more messing 'round, playing with Monroe

No more turning on the middle aged ladies

No more rocking chairs, sitting on the front porch
(Ohohoh sitting on the front porch)
No more soft drugs, playing the space race
(Ohohoh playing in the space race)
All I remember was your levi sta-prest
(Ohohoh your levi sta-prest)
All I remember was the catholic day

For you and I are privileged to serve the great Republic
in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history.
The choices we make, for good or ill, 
will affect the welfare of generations yet unborn.

I see the chickens have come home to roost <i>[repeat 6x]</i>

In the world beyond our borders,
steady progress has been made in building a world of order.
The people of West Berlin remain free and secure.
A settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos.

(BANG!)
