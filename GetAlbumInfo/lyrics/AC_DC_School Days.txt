Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical maths
(you) studyin' hard and hoping to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room is ready to sell (kitchen's ready to sell)
(but) you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
(well) back in the classroom open your books
Gee but the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Hail hail rock 'n' roll

(as) soon as 3 o'clock rolls aroun'
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books and out of your seat
You go down the hallway, into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been
You find a juke joint, you go in

Drop the quarter into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go

Long live rock 'n' roll

Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
