So suddenly
You seem to be
So into me
Well I can see
You're not fooling anyone
Would you wait for me
We'll wait and see
The apathy
You ask from me
Is that everything that you want
I thought I should tell you
My mistake was falling in
I thought I should tell you

No
I want you to go
Don't need you to say that you want me
So what if you
What if you go
It's time that you know
Don't care if you stay or you leave me
So what if you
What if you go

So you're feeling me
You're feeling free
To scream at me
And laugh at me
It's my fall from fate that she wants
She's shouting she's shaking
It's the same old situation
I know
I know I can let go
I thought I should tell you
That I made my last mistake
I thought I should tell you

No
I want you to go
Don't need you to say that you want me
So what if you
What if you go
It's time that you know
Don't care if you stay or you leave me
So what if you
What if you go

You're living a lie
You're living a dream
You're holding on so tight
You're living the way you think you should be
It's hard to tell you go
No
It's time to let this go
So sad to say
Now you see what if you
What if you go
I want you to go
Don't need you to say that you want me
So what if you
What if you go
It's time that you know
Don't care if you stay or you leave me
So what if you
What if you go
So what if you go
Go
I want you go
Don't need you to say that you want me
So go
I want you to go
Don't care if you stay or you leave me
Go
