The horizon, now as dark as the crimes that brought them here,
Is filled with my impending dread...
My foolish actions will cost so many good men
Achilles has come...

A thousand sails approaching
Sent here in her name to reclaim the one I stole
And destroy the walls of Troy...

Desire leaves me numb to all the pain surrounding me
To all the pain surrounding me
Storms will arise to condemn me
I will not die before her eyes...
It ends tonight

Tragically I now must accept the penance I have earned
She is cursed and tonight we die
In the dawn of this, my end, I hold my sword true
I must let her go

A thousand sails approaching
Sent here in her name to reclaim the one I stole
And destroy the walls of Troy...

Desire leaves me numb to all the pain surrounding me
To all the pain surrounding me
Storms will arise to condemn me
I will not die before her eyes...
It ends tonight

It ends tonight
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
I am alone
Pain fills her eyes
I am alone

I must save my honor,
(Sacred and profane is our love in death)
I cannot let them win,
(Sacred and profane is our love in death)
The blood of many spills
(Sacred and profane is our love)
In death
