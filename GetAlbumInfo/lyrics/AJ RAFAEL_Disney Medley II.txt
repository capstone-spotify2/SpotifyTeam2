When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

The second star to the right
Shines in the night for you
And if it's Never Land you need
It's light will lead you there

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away

That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Tell me we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea 

I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you

An ape like me
Can learn to be humen too

Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put 'em together and what have you got
bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

Salagadoola means mechicka booleroo
But the thingmabob that does the job is
bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

Out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give (What I'd give)
What I'd dare (What I'd dare)
Just to live one day out there

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me
