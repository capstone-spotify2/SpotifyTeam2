Night rolls in
Gone is the wind
Fireflies dancing in your eyes
Now you're holy again
Oh night rolls in
Oh night rolls in

It's like a dream of a long time ago
A footprint lost in the snow
That covers the ground where we summered our lives
Watching them grow
From seeds that you sow

But now the world in all its works and ways
Grays our Novembering days
The fire still glows
That once was a rose

A long time ago
Night rolls in
Gone is the wind
Fireflies dancing in your eyes
And now you're holy again
Oh night rolls in
Oh night rolls in
Night rolls in

Gone is the wind
Fireflies dancing in your eyes
And now you're holy again
Oh night rolls in
Oh night rolls in
Oh night rolls in
