Here I come to find myself, catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself feel the tide
I'm all at sea and so unwise

I'm so afraid I'd lose your love as time goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset builds a memory - our love signed
And all I see becomes a lie

Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call the setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home!

I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I designed
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all I see we say goodbye

Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call the setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home!
