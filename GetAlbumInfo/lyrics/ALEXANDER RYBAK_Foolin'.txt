Nobody knows the way I'm feelin
I try to scream instead I smile
The world is strange
I must be dreamin
How can I stop this just for a while
The morning rain will soon be falling
But I don't care cause I've already cried
Can't see the meaning of this
But one things certain
I'm afraid I'm loosin my mind
Somebody else will be her boyfriend
Somebody else will have her heart
But still I love her so
How could I let her go
I was foolin myself

The sky is blue and birds are singing
The sun does shine
And kids are playing game
What have I done
What was I thinking
The only thing to do is hiding shame
Somebody else will be her boyfriend
Somebody else will have her heart
But still I love her so
How could I let her go
I was foolin myself

Somebody else will be her boyfriend
Somebody else will have her heart
But I still need her so
How could I let her go
I was foolin myself
I was foolin myself
