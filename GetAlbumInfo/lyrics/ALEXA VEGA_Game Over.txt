Game Over. There are no rules in
This game. Except win at any costs

The time has come once and for all you've
Met your match you will fall.
This little game we play is gonna break us down.
Only one of us can wear the crown its
Not as easy as you thought it'd be.
When its down to you vs. me

I'll play ya rough,
I don't need to try.
You'd like to play me,
But the score never lies

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Game Over, Game Over
Game Over, For Now.....

When in the games the only rule allowed
No mother love or cheers from the crowd
Wen the game began you never thought you'd
Lose, but your time is up, I'll play the rules
Ya look around and find you've lost your team
You tried your best but you ran out of steam

I'll play ya rough,
I don't need to try.
You'd like to play me,
But the score never lies

You're all out of wishes case your dreams
Collide and ends the same its not whether
You win or lose its how you play the game

Game Over, Game Over
Game Over, For Now.....

OoOoOoOoOoOo...........

Is that all you got 
Come On. Uh huh.
Bring It On!

Game Over, Game OVer
Game OVer, For Now....

Game Over.
