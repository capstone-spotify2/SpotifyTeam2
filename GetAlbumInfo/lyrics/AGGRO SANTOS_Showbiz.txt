Yet Everyday I Slaughter These Mics,
Some Say Im Cold Some Say Im Jus Right
Lyrics At Yard Im Writing Them Out,
Then Im At The Rave Reciting Them Out,
Bring A Couple Nice Girls Back To The House, And Straight Up Show Them What Aggros About, Chicks Beef Its Part Of The Show Life, I Cant Be Slippin And Role With No Knife, Im Gettin Bigger And I Dont Mean My Height, Im Still Unsigned They Cant Control My Life, Some Try And Flop Me But Its All Bless Ill Give U A Lesson In Being Succesful, Class A Tuition Call Me The Best School, Im Too Intense U Mite Need Prep School
