<i>[George:]</i> A man sits at his desk
One year from retirement,
And he's up for review
Not quite sure what to do.
Each passing year
The workload grows.

<i>[Dallas:]</i> I'm always wishing, I'm always wishing too late
For things to go my way
It always ends up the same
(Count your blessings)
I must be missing, I must be missing the point
Your signal fades away and all I'm left with is noise
(Count your blessings on one hand)

So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight.
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life

<i>[George:]</i> Poor little tin man, still swinging his axe,
Even though his joints are clogged with rust.

<i>[Wade:]</i> My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away.
Safe in monotony, (so safe), day after day
(Count your blessings)
My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away.
Cold wind blows off the lake, and I know for sure that it's too late
(Count your blessings on one hand)

<i>[Dallas:]</i> So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life.

Can't help but feel betrayed, punch the clock every single day
There's no loyalty and no remorse.
Youth sold for a pension cheque
And it makes him fucking sick
He's heating up, he can't say no

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight,
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life.
(So wait up)
So wait up I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
Between the light and shallow waves is where I'm going to die
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
