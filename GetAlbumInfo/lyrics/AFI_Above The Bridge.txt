Itâs too much to take, the thought of it all. Release me distraction.
Itâs too much to take, the thought of my fall, shameful attraction.
What happened to the place Iâd hide? Who taught you how to sneak inside?
Itâs too much to take. Itâs too much to take.

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above that bridge.

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above our bridge.
And Iâve floated since that day.

Itâs too much to take, the thought of it all. Release me distraction.
Itâs too much to take, the thought of my fall, shameful attraction.
What happened to the place Iâd hide? I taught you how to sneak inside.
Itâs too much to take. Itâs too much to take. Itâs too much to take. Itâs too...

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above that bridge.

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above our bridge.
And Iâve floated since that day.

I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
Behind your eyes.

I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
I thought I saw the sky
Behind your eyes.

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above that bridge.

I saw you step upon that bridge.
I saw you walk across that bridge.
I saw you float above our bridge.
And Iâve floated since that day.
