She was home all alone on a Saturday Night
She was all dressed up, not a thing going on
When this online dating infomercial caught her eye
She laughed and thought to herself
All the good ones are gone,
Still she jumped on the net, filled out her registration
Well luckily gave her a age and occupation
How much do you make what do you love to do
Take care congratulations found the perfect match for you

She thought oooh. last thing I need is another
Pickup truck and some pickup line oooh. from some wannabe cowboy
Wasting my time with red roses and wine
I love fast cars, slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And I don't mind dancing, I wanna fall in love
Wanna waltz across Texas, looking for a good ole' fashion romance

Now at the very same time, on the other side of town
His busted up broken heart, was lookin for a rebound
And that online dating infomercial caught his eye
He had nothing to lose so he gave it a try

He thought ooh. last thing I need is another pretty girl
Who just wants to have fun oooh. but when he read what she wrote
That is when he said to himself, this one's the one
I love fast cars slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And I don't mind dancing, I wanna fall in love
Wanna waltz across Texas, I'm looking for a good ole' fashion romance

Oooh. some find true love in a bar, in a church love will find you
Where ever your at, they struck a match made in heaven
Who wouldn't want to find something like that,

They loved fast cars slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And they don't mind dancing, they walk down the isle
Then they waltz across Texas, finally found a good ole fashion romance
Good 'ole country fashion romance, fast cars slow months
