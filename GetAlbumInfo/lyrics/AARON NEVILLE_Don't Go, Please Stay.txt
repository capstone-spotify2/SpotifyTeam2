Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay

If I got on my knees and pleaded with you
Not to go, but to stay in my heart
Would you walk out the door
Like you did once before
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go

If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go

But this time be different in some way
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay

You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved by your kiss

If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
