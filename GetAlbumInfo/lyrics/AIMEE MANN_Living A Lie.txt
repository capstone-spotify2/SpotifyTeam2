<i>[James Mercer:]</i>
You can see yourself in the side mirror
tossing your hair
if no one is there
why do you care
Though I let you think there was no witness to
all of your crimes
I knew what you were:
a climber who climbs

<i>[Aimee Mann and James Mercer:]</i>
Iâm living a lie
youâre living it too
cause I live it with you
Iâm living a lie
a lie I canât tell
so we wait for a crack in the shell

<i>[Aimee Mann:]</i>
No one bears a grudge like a boy genius
Just past his prime
Gilding his cage
One bar at a time
For every open arm there's a cold shoulder
Waiting to turn
People to blame
Bridges to burn

<i>[Aimee Mann and James Mercer:]</i>
Iâm living a lie
youâre living it too
cause I live it with you
Iâm living a lie
a lie I canât tell
so we wait for a crack in the shell

<i>[James Mercer:]</i>
A girl comes around at a time when your ground
is as shaky as leaves on a tree
creating for you a persona or two
or an out-and-out mythology

<i>[Aimee Mann:]</i>
Now thereâs too many cooks but you like how it looks
when theyâre bowing and calling you âbossâ
but the powers that were, were invested in her
and now winning means taking a loss

<i>[Aimee Mann and James Mercer:]</i>
Iâm living a lie
youâre living it too
cause I live it with you
Iâm living a lie
a lie I canât tell
so we wait for a crack in the shell
