Forget about the world outside this is now or never
I know we're gonna own this night you and I together

You've been looking in the wrong wrong place for love
You've been reaching out but you just can't touch
You've been thinking 'bout in the way too much
If you wanna be with someone

That somebody is me <i>[4x]</i>
That somebody is
That somebody is me

Forget about the world outside I'll be the best you ever
This is gonna change your life I'm here to make it better


You've been looking in the wrong wrong place  for love
You've been reaching out but you just can't touch
You've been thinking 'bout in the way too much
If you wanna be with someone

That somebody is me <i>[4x]</i>
That somebody is

Ooh

That somebody is 

Ooh

That somebody is me

Forget about the world outside 
This is gonna change your life 

That somebody is me <i>[4x]</i>
That somebody is

Forget about the world outside 
That somebody is me
This is gonna change your life 
That somebody is me
