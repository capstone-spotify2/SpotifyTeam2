I've walked down high streets looking through windows.
I've been lost in crowds of strangers.
Searched record shops and cosmetic aisles, phone books, want ads, bus stops and libraries.
Newspaper headlines, mannequin faces, television stations, billboard advertisements.
Your voice echoes in the back of my mind.
I see your face when I close my eyes.

Do you share the same sense of defeat?
Have you realized all the things you'll never be?
Ideals turn to resentment, open minds close up with cynicism.
I've got no judgement for you.
Come on and ache with me.

Through bar rooms, cafÃ©s, jail cells and court rooms. 
Theaters, restaurants, graveyards and churches. 
I've spent every dollar that I've ever earned. 
I'll bleed my heart out, I'll give every word. 
I've asked preachers, doctors and lawyers, socialites, pariahs, mothers and fathers. 
You may not find all that you're after, in the end I hope it doesn't matter.

Do you share the same sense of defeat?
Have you realized all the things you'll never be?
Ideals turn to resentment, open minds close up with cynicism.
I've got no judgement for you.
Come on and ache with me.
