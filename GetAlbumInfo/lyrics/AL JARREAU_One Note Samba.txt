La, la la la...
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note

Now this new note is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable
Consequence of you

There's so many people
Who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing
Or nearly nothing

I have used up all
The scale I know and at the end
I've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing

So I come back to the one note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that this one note
All the love I feel for you

There are those who wants the whole show
DÃ³-rÃ©-mi-fÃ¡-lÃ¡-ti-dÃ³
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know
