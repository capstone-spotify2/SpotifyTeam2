I got that killa, yeah

It's 4:20 in the morning, baby I'ma blow your mind
I could tell that you want it
Cause I can see it in your eyes
You wanna run your fingers, all over my body
You break me down
We gonn mess around
Now the alarm going off in this motherfucker

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I got that killa, illa, baby that uh wee
Made me the eulogy
Cause I got that killa, illa
When hittin in fire, you'll be higher
I'm talking bout that killa, illa
So good I'm always on your mind
That killa, killa, illa
Baby you know I got
That killa, killa, illa
That killa

Wanting on me naked, damn your body burning up
You telling me to take it
Cause you know I'm fin to turn it up
Your pussy just get <i>[?]</i> that big
You bite your lips, and you scratchin me
Saying you never had it like this
Now we done messed around, I don't let it down and run

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I got that killa, illa, baby that uh wee
Made me the eulogy
Cause I got that killa, illa
When hittin in fire, you'll be higher
I'm talking bout that killa, illa
So good I'm always on your mind
That killa, killa, illa
Baby you know I got
That killa, killa, illa
That killa

I got that Korean I do, hit you with my hook shot
Known for bringing dikes back, cause this ain't what that butch got
Tired of getting that pussy played with, I'm the antidote
Dark skin, 6.2., fuck good and I'm dope
You heard me on this beat before, know I'm fin to swag it out
Let me in that pussy, swear to god you have to drag me out
Quit screaming girl, tough it out, your dude I gives a fuck about
Rich rich got that kill, anything less I don't know much about

4 am man she always come over
Block full of killa and I'm leanin never sober
Baby girl drank a cup now she bendin over
I'm all up behind her like a dog, rover
She say I be killin it, killin it and lickin it
Pretty ass face, full of sticky shit, stinky bitch
Photos, iPhones, pictures with the mall
Prim rose, she just on my dick because I ball
