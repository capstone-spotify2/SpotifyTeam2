I play the game of the modern romeo but never in my life did I see
A woman as square as a pool table and twice as green
I gave you all of my money and all of my loving too
But now you're goin' around just a telling everybody that I made a fool of you
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you
You're a hard nut to crack
You take a strong man and break his back
I don't know but I've been told, next to you my life's been cold
You're a demon, girl, you know you're outta sight

Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
Ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you

Know the guy you're giving my money
And you come home and call me honey
You look like you made a resolution, took my best friend john and put him in an institution
You're a demon, girl you know you're outta sight

Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above to help me to save your love
I want you

You're a hard nut to crack
