I hear them over and over again
Same empty words we spoke in the dark
As I watched you leave I tried to pretend
That I was strong and we could never burn
But now I sit here alone, a fool with a bleeding heart

Oh, tonight I need, tonight I need your love
To lift me up
Tonight I need, tonight I need your love
To lift me up

I see your face when I turn out the lights
I reach out to touch you but there's nothin' there
I wish I could hold you tonight
And make all your wrongs go right, whoa yeah

Oh, tonight I need, tonight I need your love
To lift me up
Tonight I need, tonight I need your love
To lift me up

I tried to call you tonight, I needed an answer
My feelings are too strong to fight
'Cause I need you here with me tonight

Oh, tonight, tonight I need your love
To lift me up
Tonight I need, tonight I need your love
To lift me up
Tonight I need, tonight I need your love
Lift me up

'Cause I need you over and over again, oh yeah
Lift me up
I try to hide it but I can't pretend
So lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
