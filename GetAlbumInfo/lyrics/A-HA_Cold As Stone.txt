You're back again
You roam the streets
And crack again
You're back again

You're travel-worn
Standing here in the town
Where you were born
It's not your home

The mirror sees you
So alone
...Cold as stone - Yeah

You're not your own
You feel a chill
Go through your bones 

You're not your own
There's something wrong
You call the doctor on a phone 
He's not at home

So you leave a message 
After the tone -
"I'm cold as stone"

Emerald green neon lights above
Sapphire red falls on you below 
Cold as stone

Emerald green neon lights above
Sapphire reds fall on you below

You're back again
You send a curse out
In to the night
You're back again

You're travel-worn
Standing here 
In the town you were born
It's not your home

The mirror sees you 
So alone 
...Cold as stone
Cold as stone
