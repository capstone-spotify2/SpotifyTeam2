Okay
Uh, okay I walked in the party Mr. swag, so gnarly
With a bad Spanish mammy betta ask somebody
Yea that's my Maseratti, going ham no salami
That's your chick if I like it then I'm straight bo guarding
In the club where the bottles at, Rosay no Muscato
They see me, models follow, ass clap, Aye, bravo
I'll be why then my niggas see my jewels, they six figures
Fuck your girl and her friend. I'm a dog. How'd you figure?
Chillin' with my click and I puff that loud
She don't wanna fuck... then I tell a bitch bye,
Heart so cold, why waste my time?
Twenty on the wrist cause I like the shine
Fuck you niggas who hate on mine
Credit card will not declined
Missionary no, not me, I like that pussy from behind
Bitch I'm balling every day, it's like somebody pressed rewind
All my niggas came from nothing, mandatory that we shine
Private plane and no complainin' if I happen to recline
Same nigga that they doubted and I'm glad they don't remind
Made a million off my hunger, that's just solely my reply
Cause we da best, shit ain't a lie

Had to bring the money home
I had to bring the money home
Motherfucker, we on
I had to bring the money home
Motherfucker, we on
I had to bring the money home
Then I catch me in your city, with a clip the niggas with me
Couple bitches getting tipsy, celebrating cause we winning
We on (we on) we on (we on)
And we on (and we on) and we on (and we on)
I go so hard, niggas already know
Still in the club when they close at 4
Birthday girl gon drop it low
Let's make a toast to never broke us
We on (we on) we on (we on)
And we on (and we on) and we on (on)

Okay, now one for the money, Shorty two for the fuck of it
Pull up in some shit that just might destroy all your confidence
Meet a bitch and hit it quick and never know her government
I been rocking Hermes and that H don't stand for hooligan
High boy, I fly, high nigga, blast off
You goof truth loose goose prove you ain't cutting soft
We on, we on, way to keep on, bring on
All these cases of that aces, bring them back to my oasis
Taking shots after shots like I'm busting off that 44
Man, that ciroc, got me feeling like I overdosed
Living with my niggas, celebrating, rocking hella gold
Ring hella big, you would think I won the Super Bowl
Yea, we in the building, why the fuck you think it's super flow?
Tell the DJ bring it back and show 'em what we really on
All these women love me cause they know a youngun money long
Mama told me get it so I had to bring the money home

Had to bring the money home
I had to bring the money home
Motherfucker, we on
I had to bring the money home
Motherfucker, we on
I had to bring the money home
Then I catch me in your city, with a clip the niggas with me
Couple bitches getting tipsy, celebrating cause we winning
We on (we on) we on (we on)
And we on (and we on) and we on (and we on)
I go so hard, niggas already know
Still in the club when they close at 4
Birthday girl gon drop it low
Let's make a toast to never broke us
We on (we on) we on (we on)
And we on (and we on) and we on (on)
