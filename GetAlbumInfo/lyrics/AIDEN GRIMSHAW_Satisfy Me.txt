Are you gonna shut your pretty mouth?
Your words don't mean a single thing right now
Keep pushing but I'm scared to make a sound
You're scaring me
Are you gonna scratch that gentle skin?
Scratch it till the blood runs warm again
To satisfy the selfish state you're in
Satisfy me

<i>[Thaddaeus Tribbett:]</i>
I must be out of my mind thinking you'd ever change
Don't know why I even try, yeah, you love the pain
If you could see what I see, if you could feel what I feel
Then you would close your mouth and satisfy me for real

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
I'm sorry I offend you
Never meant to upset you
Although my feelings stay the same
My meaning's growing with you
When we fight, it's electric
When you smile, it's electric
You're a toxic lover
Toxic lover

Are you gonna fuck your stupid mind?
Let me be alone for a piece of time
Cover up my thoughts, baby, I should try
You drive my crazy
I bet you're gonna hate my stupid love
Feel like a child, I've had enough
A killer in the wall with the softest touch
You're touching me

<i>[Thaddaeus Tribbett:]</i>
I must be out of my mind thinking you'd ever change
Don't know why I even try, yeah, you love the pain
If you could see what I see, if you could feel what I feel
Then you would close your mouth and satisfy me for real

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

I won't cause I don't <i>[?]</i>
Because you always abuse my heart
This time, I know that we're over
Cause you reminded me from the start
