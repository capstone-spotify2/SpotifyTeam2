I'll live for you, I'll breathe for you
I'll be for you

I can hear above the noise
There is something on the wind
And behind your eyes I can see the pain

I am not a shallow sea
I run deeper than you think
And I will not leave

When the echoes from the walls
Are the voices in your head
Don't listen to the lies
Just hear my words instead

For now and ever more
I live for you, I'll breathe for you
I'll be for you and nothing else matters
Nothing else matters, nothing else matters
Nothing else matters

Every silence of a sigh
I can feel it on my skin
Every cry for help tears into my heart

Love is not a shallow sea
It runs deeper than you think
And it will not leave

When the echoes from the walls
Are the voices in your head
Don't listen to the lies
Just hear my words instead

For now and ever more
I'll live for you, I'll breathe for you
I'll be for you and nothing else matters
Nothing else matters, nothing else matters
Nothing else matters

I'll live for you, I'll breathe for you
I'll be for you
