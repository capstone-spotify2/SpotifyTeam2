<i>[Intro:]</i>
I feel alright <i>[x4]</i>

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
I can hear my granny speaking from the land of heaven
Pray I get the message, bible on me every second
Devils spirits get rejected soon as I detect it
Oh lord I am a sinner, nothing like perfection
Money fetish coming steady barely see the reverend
Hope my life is right with Christ before it's Armageddon
Lord knows it's cold world and it ain't apologetic
Keep my bible on my side just know I'm armed and ready
If we got a problem, scriptures like 100 choppers
Ain't no weapon for what gets me to whatever prosper
Devils come in different forms watch for the impostors
Cause' everybody ain't your friends put that on my momma
Words of the wise, faith and hope will never die
Prayin to a higher God before I rest an eye
Seven angels on my collar must I testify?
Know some youngin's totin' guns before they baptized
Man this world is out of order, keep ya' holy water
Daddy gotta go, I kiss the cheek on my lil' daughter
Steady hustlin' just to support my covenant
Bible with me that's stronger than any government
I'm never worried devil lurking, trying to serve a purpose
Triple black phantom ghost, lord have mercy
Only God can judge me I never need attorney
Hear my momma prayin' for me on this lonely journey (amen)

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
How sweet is the sound
Bloodsuckers, never trust em' I don't keep em' around
Holding on to my Jesus piece, no demons allowed
Put that ice in the crown, never preachin the foul
Know the snakes are watching
Every dollar to pocket
Jealousy in your soul, every nigga will gossip
Lord knows I'm sinning, timberlands in the trenches
Psalms 91, please lord protect those with me
Why they hate on me? I got my strap on me
It came with a million bullets come and test out these
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Got the word of God for any spirit that's there
Got the blood of Jesus on my white Nike Airs
Lion hearted lil' nigga with the force of a bear
I'm beast mode, never wanna see that side I suppose
And my eyes closing, praying for niggas with hate in they soul
Please guide my steps, cause' it's hell out there
Pussy niggas playin dirty tryin' to plan my death
20 Jesus pieces on me like I can't be touched
Every soul needs saved but it can't be rushed
People dying everyday just pray it ain't one of us
Keep my bible right beside me know what God I trust.
Yes lord, amen, amen
Long as I got my bible
Long as I got my bible
I scream (Jesus)
