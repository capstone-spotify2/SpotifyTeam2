Somebody told me that someone told them
That you was hanging with a girl named Kim say uh uh
Tell me this ain't true

Why you laughing?
Do I look like I am playing?
Wipe that smurk or start confessing
Is it true what I've been hearing? (is it true?)

Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt?
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh
Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt? oh
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh

You told me that your love was deeper than the sea
But I'm standing here looking really crazy
Said uh uh (uh uh)
I'm feeling like a fool

I get a good loving, but you are still messing
Around with a hepper that's 5 foot 7
Miss Love E got nothing on me
You had a 10, now you're hanging with a 3

Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt?
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh
Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt? oh
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh

Paps said I should leave it alone
But I'm too hurt to let it go
My friends screaming at me 'shit girl, what you doin? '
You gonna end up doing time

Saying 'baby girl, this isn't you'
You're life is not, Miss Lorena Bobbitt
Uh uh...

Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt?
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh
Have you heard of that girl Lorena Bobbitt? oh
Well, you're gonna meet her oh oh
