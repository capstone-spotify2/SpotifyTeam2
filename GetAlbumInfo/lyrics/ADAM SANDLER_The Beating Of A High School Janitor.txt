"And now, the sever beating of a high school janitor."

<i>[Mopping sounds]</i>
Mop, mop, mop
All day long
Mop, mop, mop
While I sing this song

<i>[Sound of someone walking towards him]</i>
Gonna wax the floor
Gonna make it shine
Gonna take of the spray paint
With turpentine

"Hey! Don't walk there! I just mopped!"
<i>[Person walking quickly towards him]</i>
<i>[Beating sounds]</i>
"Hey!"
<i>[Beating sounds]</i>
"Get offa me!"
<i>[Beating sounds]</i>
"That's my bucket!"
<i>[Beating sounds]</i>
"Let go of my side burns!"
<i>[Beating sounds]</i>
<i>[Sound of falling down into glass]</i>
