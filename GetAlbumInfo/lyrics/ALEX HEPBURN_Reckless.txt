I, I'm different I'm driving on the right side and stopping
At the stop signs and there's you beside me baby
Whispering those words
The ones I don't deserve
It's not easy for me to belong here

I wanna be reckless
I wanna destroy this
Don't wanna regret this
Like I've done before

I wanna be out there
In the middle of nowhere
Lost forever like I was before
Like I was before you came

I, I'm learning
To go against my nature
It feels like I'm a stranger to myself
And it's frightening baby
I don't know where I'm heading
But wake me when I get there
It's not easy for me to belong here

I wanna be reckless
I wanna destroy this
Don't wanna regret this
Like I've done before

I wanna be out there
In the middle of nowhere
Lost forever like I was before
Like I was before you came

Don't feel like punishing myself
I've done my time
And I made a promise to myself
So I might as well be reckless
I promise you won't regret this
Like you've done before

I wanna be reckless
I wanna destroy this
Don't wanna regret this
Like I've done before

I wanna be out there
In the middle of nowhere
Lost forever like I was before
Like I was before you came
