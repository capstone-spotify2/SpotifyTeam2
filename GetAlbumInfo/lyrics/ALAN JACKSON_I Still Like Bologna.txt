There's
Satellite communications
Long distance
Internet relations
The world's
A little faster every day
I know it's all
Well and good
And I don't embrace it
Like I should
But I wouldn't wanna go
Backwards even if I could

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But I still
Like Bologna
On white bread
Now and then
And the sound
Of a whippoorwill
Down a country road
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
To hold me close
I like my 50 inch
HD plasma

Feels like
They just reach out
And grab you
500 channels
At my command
I finally gave in
And got a cell phone
That I hardly
Ever seem to turn on
I guess I never had
That much to say

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I got a laptop
That sits on a desk
I don't use it much
Except to check
On some ole car
From yesterday
I kinda like
That music thang
You just download 'em
And you can save about
Every song
That's ever been made

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Well I guess
What I've been
Trying to say
This digital world
Is okay
It makes life better
Iin a lot of ways
But it can't make
The smell of spring
Or sunshine or lots
Of little things
We take for granted
Every day

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Yeah, Bologna
A woman's love
And a good cell phone
