Life can be black and white, we need a little colour
That's what I'm searching for
It's like I'm driving blind, I need a little summer
I need to feel the warmth

The touch, the taste, I'm feeling all my senses going off
The way that you do
A moth, the flame, I've finally got the message
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

It's like I'm burning alive
You're my fuel in my fire tonight
I'm burning alive
I've got a ticket to ride tonight
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) <i>[x4]</i>

Her body light the streets
Sometimes her beauty's blinding
I let her take my soul
ohhhh...

The touch, the taste, I'm feeling all my senses going off
The way that you do
A moth, the flame, I've finally got the message
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

It's like I'm burning alive
You're my fuel in my fire tonight
I'm burning alive
I've got a ticket to ride tonight
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) <i>[x4]</i>

I'm seeing colour
I'm seeing colour
I'm seeing colour
Yeah

It's like I'm burning alive
You're my fuel in my fire tonight
I'm burning alive
I've got a ticket to ride tonight
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) 
(Life can be black and white, we need a little colour, I need to feel the warmth)
Drive, Drive, Drive
(Let's just drive) <i>[x4]</i>
