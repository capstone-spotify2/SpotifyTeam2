I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage 
about the Ak, they don't know me from a tree in the forest 
My name's not summer so I don't sweat it 
Most y'all niggaz know I cut ya like cheese that's cheddared 
I been around the world like Lisa Stansfield tour bus 
Tearin niggaz up from here to West Bubblefuck 
So don't front like you don't know what my name is 
Before I start diving up in that ass like Greg Louganis 
That's not my number one AMOS 
You take my style and squeeze your lips 
like probably you see your life stopped, you're freakin FAMOUS 
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS 
I hit you in the ANUS 
Once y'all reach for the damn A-LIST 
still, this ain't the pretty boy 
Fear sex-appeal it's Ak, a.k.a. the real deal 
I make punk rappers stutter, y-yoyoy-yoyoy-yoyo 
I bring out the Das EFX in a motherfucker 
I livin larger than a mansion, you hear me? 
You fear me, you're just a Little House on the Praerie 
Leave 'fore Hurricane Ak come blowin in 
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind 
Check the news forecast 
I place a con niggaz'll stick ya on your butt 
If you're light in the ass 
Close your eyes, and concentrate it's time to recognize 
The Ak keep brothers on checkmate 

Check over there, and then check over here 
Just lend me your ear, c'mon listen 

Nigga you just can't defeat me 
Child abusers walk around, knowin they just can't beat me 
So don't try to take the winner's belt 
Aiyyo this ain't April 1st so don't dare fool yourself 
It don't get no liver, I'm hittin harder than a chastiser 
I flip rhymes like saliva, poundin on your BRAIN 
With the sick shit I'm SAYING 
I got more GAME than a panhandler on a TRAIN 
Huh, it's rare if I don't catch props 
I'm the Ak I tear that ass out the frame like a benzie box 
You know the rules if you ain't ruff 
Stay on the hush and get played like Sunday school shoes 
and get scuffed, I put heads to bed like newlyweds 
Sing your rap eulogy 
Cuz now you're good as dead 
Hit the deck, once I round it off like a Tec 
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check 
Checkmate 

Check all around, and then check for them clowns 
Check the fuckin real sound, break down 

In English, MC's can't last 
Similar to a car crash, I got rap in a smash 
Whenever you wanna get loose and hang out 
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout 
Think you'll last? Then come try 
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet 
I'm out to catch the winner's cup 
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up 
What nigga what? I'm blowin up the spot with dynamite 
rhymes by the Ak 
Airports they amazed to me 
Shit cuz I fly so much heads yah have my own travel agency 
Rap's are fat like SUMO, slammin like JUDO 
I won't get abused like numbers, I'm MENUDO 
I got the art down pat, pass the courderoy 
this bad boy about to start to slack 
Fuck how "I could just kill a maaaan" 
I'm slick and puttin brothers out with these Edward Niggahands 
Ten fingers of death, grippin micraphones 
Holdin my own, sparkin rhymes up like grindstones 
Rippin up challengers 
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher 
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER 
Dirty like a CAMPER 
On top of that I've been through more shit than PAMPERS 
Fake is what I ain't 
But Constantine the Great, don't know me from a can of paint 
Listen to how the soundwaves vibrate 
You can't relate, I got your whole brain on checkmate 

Rob Swift is his name, with Akineyle in the game 
You're best to maintain, as we aim for your brain 
as we aim for your brain <i>[3x]</i>
