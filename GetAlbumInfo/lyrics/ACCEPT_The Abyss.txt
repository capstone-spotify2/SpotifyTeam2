The future is predestined... the writing's on the wall
Can you see the telltale signs. The turning point has come
Here it comes
Suicide bombs exploding as missiles crack the sky
Earthquakes and tsunamis, signal the end of time

In the here... and the now
Feel the fear... it's all coming down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The world is turning, turning inside out
The world is burning, it's burning on somehow
But it's broken... it's burning... goin' up in flames!

Can we change the path we're on, somehow turn the tide
Smother the all consuming fire, before the world collides

With the here... and the now
Feel the fear... all coming down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The world is turning, turning inside out
The world is burning, it's burning on somehow
The world is turning, turning inside out
The world is burning, it's burning on somehow
But it's broken... it's burning... goin' up in flames!

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Do you remember bluer skies,happy days and simpler times
Seems not that long ago
But so far away, will it ever be the same again
I Don't Think So!

Cos' it's here... and it's now
Feel the fear... all coming down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The world is turning, turning inside out
The world is burning, it's burning on somehow
But it's broken... it's burning... goin' up in flames!
Up in flames!!!
