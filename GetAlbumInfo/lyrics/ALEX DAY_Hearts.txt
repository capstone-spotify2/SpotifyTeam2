There's someone out there in the world like you
With perfect glossy hair and skinny jeans from Camden
But they won't be able to drive me crazy
'Cos that's a curse that only you seem to know how to do

And everytime I see you
It takes days for me to get back on my feet

I'm not that good at writing but I thought you should know
Every song's about you 'cos you're everywhere I go
If all we do is hold hands and laugh at stuff on TV
That'll still be a real good day for me

There's someone out there in the world like you
Who has such a way with words that I couldn't resist him
But I don't think you'd be impressed
'Cos even if he's more available, he won't have my honesty

And everytime I need you
I know you'll never be far away from me

I'm not that good at writing but I thought you should know
Every song's about you 'cos you're everywhere I go
If all we do is hold hands and laugh at stuff on TV
That'll still be a real good day for me

There's people out there in the world like us
Who have chemistry and the common sense to act on it
But who needs simplicity in this candid game of hearts
We'll just keep dancing 'till we tear ourselves apart

I'm not that good at writing but I thought you should know
Every song's about you 'cos you're everywhere I go
If all we do is hold hands and laugh at stuff on TV
That'll still be a real good day for me
