Antfan, there's no need to feel down
I said Antfan,'cos we ain't been around
I said Antfan, there's no others in town 
Who can do the things that we do

Antfan, there's a place you can go
I said Antfan, called the Antmusic Show
I said go there to Adam and the Ants
They can make you start new romance

It's fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on a kilt, dye your hair green
And dance to Zerox-machine
A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on that paint, and hold up your head
Till all the tough men drop dead

Antfan, I was once in your shoes
So tired, and fed up with the blues
So I went and got me a sound
And we called that sound Antmusic

No band does it just like we do
I said no band gets to satisfy you
Go there to Adam and the Ants
They can make you start new romance

Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on a kilt, dye your hair green
And dance to Zerox-machine
A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on your paint, and hold up your head
Till all the tough men drop dead

Antfan, what do you want to be
Nowhere, or an Ant just like me
You can go there to Adam and the Ants
They can make you start new romance

It's fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on your kilt, dye your hair green
And dance to Zerox-machine
A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on your paint, hold up your head
Till all the tough men drop dead

A.N.T.S.
A.N.T.S.
Put on a kilt, dye your hair green
Dance to Zerox-machine
A.N.T.S.
Fun to go to the A.N.T.S.
Put on that paint, hold up your head
Till all the tough men drop dead

A.N.T.S.
