Greetings, earthlings
My name is Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 from the planet Glamtron
What's yours?

Now, I've come a long way to be here tonight
So let's get our greetings and salutations outta the way right now, shall we?

Hiieeeeeee, oh!
I don't know about you, miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier
Now, there's an issue that's recently come to my attention that we need to discuss right now
Is that okay with you, honey?

Are you ready?
You! Are you ready? (Okay)
(Uhum) Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready!?

Your makeup is terrible
Your makeup is terrible
Your makeup is terrible
Your makeup is terrible
But I love you anyway

Terrible, terrible, terrible!
Your makeup is terrible, terrible, terrible!
Your makeup is terrible, terrible, terrible!
Your makeup is terrible!
But I love you anyway

Now, I heard this is the best motherfucking club in all the land
Is that correct? (ahuh) uhum
Well, it better be because I never had no stunt shows or shenanigans at the doorway

Mr Doorman, what's that? You need my ID?
This face is my ID, motherfucker!

Now, I'm not the kind of bitch who's gonna go behind your back and talk shit on you
If I have an issue with you, I'll bring it right to your busted face
Now, let's discuss it right now, shall we? Alrightalrightalright

Are you ready? (ahuh)
You specifically! Are you ready? (Uh me? Oh, yeah, I totally am)
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready!?

But I love you anyway

Oh my gosh!
This is the really serious part of the song, do you hear that? (Oh, my God)
You see, there's something I have to confess
You and I have a lot more in common than I thought
And it's something I need to bring to your attention right now

Are you ready? (I think so) (oh, God)
Are you ready? That's better!
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready!?
