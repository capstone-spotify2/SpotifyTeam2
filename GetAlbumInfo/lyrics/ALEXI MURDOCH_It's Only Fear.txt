Pretty, pretty on the fence,
In your pretty moment of innocence,
You do not see that I see inside,
The quiet heart you're trying to hide.

Don't hold your head too high,
Don't be afraid to cry,
Because you know my dear, it's only fear, it's only fear.

Yes my dear,do you hear,
It's only fear, it's  only fear, it's only fear,
Yes it's only fear, it's only fear, it's only fear
Keeps you locked in here.

Now you may believe you are so bright,
And you may not see how they confine your sight,
And maybe you wake up late at night,
Wondering why you feel so tired.

Well my dear, let me tell you now, do you hear,
It's only fear, it's only fear, it's only fear,
Yes it's only fear, it's only fear, it's only fear,
Yes it's only fear, it's only fear, it's only fear,
That keeps you locked in here.
