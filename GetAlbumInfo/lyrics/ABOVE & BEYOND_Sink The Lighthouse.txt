When it comes calling
The temperature's falling
Our fear is crawling
Don't quit - we're all in

The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse

Since fear itself is
Cruel and selfish
A contradiction
A fatal addiction
You've tried to shout out
My words in your mouth
But they'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse

We're hot on the angels heels
With fire and brimstone wheels
Their meadow is starred
With bones and flowers and tears
The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse

With darkness closing
We're decomposing
We're made of starlight
From cruel and dark night
The guilty crushed out
We're left in no doubt
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse

We're hot on the angels heels
With fire and brimstone wheels
Their meadow is starred
With bones and flowers and tears
The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse
