(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'm a do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
Okay, I'm booked out until August
Show money deposits
See the shit then I cop it
Got but a house note in my pocket
I'm on south beach with the top off
Bad bitch and her ass off
Something outta that catalogue
She introduced to that lock jaw
And I think her name was Lisa
Or maybe it was Sheila
My chevy sittin' too high
I call that Wiz Khalifa
And I'm all about the ben Franklins
Ain't talkin' Aretha
Bitch my league too major
I'm hiphop Derek Jeter
And I'm still feeling my pockets
Big bass and it's knocking
Yeah this be the remix
But still ride around with that rocket
I'll go walking back to my household
"We The best" be the logo
Hundred grand for that neck glow
All about the dinero
Nigga flow so retarded
We be getting gnarley
Oh Kimosabe, it be me, Ross, Weezy party cause it's the

Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'm a do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

<i>[Rick Ross:]</i>

You never know when I slide up
19 in my nina, red dot when I ride up
Hundred deep in that K.O.D
King Of Diamonds that's me nigga
No you bitches can't get my beat
Choppers only thing free niggas
Step to me and I teach you
Somebody text his picture
Straight drop in my beaker
Ace knocking my speakers
Last night I counted 1 mill
This morning 150
Pussy niggas can't count me out, don't make me hurt ya feelings, ah
V12 bugiady, jet blue, forget it
Rolex embedded with princess and baguettes

Same old brick, but's it's different yay
Yeah that's candy paint, On my 7 Tre

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i>
Ok, now, black card in my buggy
Riding round in that daddy
Pistol off my boxers
I ain't got time to be boxing
Got a red bone she look tropic
If she fuck me right then she shopping
Young money we poppin'
I eat these rappers, Anthony Hopkins
See that V-neck, that's Polo
Grilled up like Ocho
Chuck Taylors with no socks
You niggas chicken, pollo
Nigga live on Sundays, King of Diamonds Monday
Swagger just dumb, call it Kelly Bundy
Got a big house with a back yard, fish tank with sharks in it
Real nigga I'm authentic
I'll fuck the bitches 'til she short winded
Got a bad bitch who be bartending
Couple homies that gang bang
I get on anybody track and hit that bitch with that Wayne train
Free my nigga T.I
SooWoo to the beehive
Got a G6 and a G5
You pussy niggas you feline
Don't stop the party, we be getting gnarley
Oh kimosabe, I'm with Mack, Fucus and Marley

Cause it's the same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house, baby need some shoes
They want that Carter IV, bitch, it's coming soon

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
