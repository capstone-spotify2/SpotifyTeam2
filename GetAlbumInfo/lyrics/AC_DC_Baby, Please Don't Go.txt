Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone down the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby please don't go
Don't leave me

I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog woah
I'll be a dog kiss your way down here
When you walk along
Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

No baby please don't leave me
Why must you go away and do this to me baby
I wanna suffer for you, suffer, suffer
Oh baby please don't go
No!

Baby, baby, baby, please don't go, please don't go
don't go and leave me, please don't go
Baby, humm, baby, ahah
Oh don't go, no don't go
Oh don't go, no don't go
Ah don't go, don't go so slow
Oh don't go, no don't go

Why must you leave me lying on my back
Going across left side of the track
Found yourself a new man I know
So baby please don't go
Baby please don't go

No no no no
Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Ah don't go, don't go, don't go
No!
