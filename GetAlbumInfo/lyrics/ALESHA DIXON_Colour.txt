Thought that's how the world would be for me
I never knew what it was gonna take
Made some monumental mistakes
And saw the blue skies wash away

I was so lost, save me at all costs
When I need you baby, when I need you
When the lights off, I feel the rain fall
That's when I see you, that's when I see you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Colour- la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
It lived inside of my heart
You bought it back with your love
Colour- la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
When it was all black and white
You made everything right
You make it right right right right

I forgot who I was supposed to be
Reminded me of a hope again, you made me dream
Red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, violet, green
You're the start and the end of my rainbow

I was so lost, save me at all costs
When I need you baby, when I need you
When the lights off, I feel the rain fall
That's when I see you, that's when I see you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If the rain falls hard, I know where you are
I know where you are if the rain falls
If the rain falls hard, I know where you are
I know where you are if the rain falls

<i>[Chorus]</i>
