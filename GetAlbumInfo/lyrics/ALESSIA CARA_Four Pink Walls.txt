I grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing

I assumed that there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?

Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid

I assumed that there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from "when boredom strikes" to "Ms. Star on the Rise"
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man

Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
