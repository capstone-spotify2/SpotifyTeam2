Woah
Oh, yeah

Is everything just right
Don't want you thinking that I'm in a hurry
I want to stay your friend
I have this vision that has got me worried
Because everyone wants someone
That's one cliche that's true
The sad truth's I want no one
Unless that someone's you

And looks like you
And feels like you
And smiles like you
I want someone just like you
Through and through
I'm forever blue
Because there's no one else like

I hope that you're not mad
You always said you want a man of action
I'm not the hottest lad, no 
There's more to life than physical attraction
You got your special someone
But between me and him, guess who
Will spend their whole life waiting
For someone just like  you

That looks like you
That feels like you
That smiles like you
I need someone just like you 
Love me true
I'm forever blue
Because there's no one else like

Woah

I want you in my arms
I see you in my dreams
I'm gonna make you mine
As crazy as it seems
Girl, you, yes you
I need someone just like you
Love me true
I'm forever blue
Because there's no one else,
There's no one else <i>[x6]</i>
There's no one else I need 
Because you're so fine, 
You're so fine <i>[x5]</i>
