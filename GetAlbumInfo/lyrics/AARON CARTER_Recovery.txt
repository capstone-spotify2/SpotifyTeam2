You took the sun out of the sky
You let the storm in overnight  
And now I'm standing here wondering why

You took the beat out of my heart
And now I don't know who you are
You got me looking for the good in goodbye

It's time for me to let go
Hit me like a hurricane
Gonna be a tidal wave
And now I'm back on solid ground
Tomorrow is a new day 
Try to shake the pain away

'Cause I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery

I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery
Recovery
Recovery

I know it's taking me a while
'Cause I was living in denial, yeah
For a minute I forgot how to smile
But I would be lying if I told you it's not killing me, yeah 
And I never thought that you would end up my worst enemy 

It's time for me to let you go
Hit me like a hurricane
Gonna be a tidal wave
And now I'm back on solid ground
Tomorrow is a new day 
Try to shake the pain away

'Cause I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery

I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery
Recovery

I've come too far
To turn back now
I have broke my heart
I put it back again 

Hit me like a hurricane
Gonna be a tidal wave
And now I'm back on solid ground
Tomorrow is a new day 
Try to shake the pain away

'Cause I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery

I'm still in
Recovery 
Recovery
Recovery

'Cause I'm still in
Recovery

I'm still in
Recovery

I come too far...
