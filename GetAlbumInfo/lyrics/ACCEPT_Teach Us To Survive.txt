No one knows what we should do
No one tells what we should know
We're starving
No one cares about the law
No one tells use what we saw
We're starving (starving)

We never know whom we're believing
We don't know the things we're doing
Looking for some real teachers

No one can explain the future
No one cares how we get nuts
We're crying
No one tells us how to love you
No one shows how we can win
We're losing

Why don't you help us growing
Why don't you teach us dying
We wanna know how you are doing

Why don't you help us growing
Why don't you teach us dying
We wanna know how you are doing
Wanna know how you survive

Survive - survive - survive - survive - survive - survive
