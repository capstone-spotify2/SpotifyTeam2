I've been watching you
You've been watchin' too
So sassy slinky that
I felt the heat at first sight
Is this burn for you all right

You smile and start to sway
Your satin slips away
This sweet obsession brings
A torch to my dreams all night

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Such a killer, such a killer love
Such a killer, such a killer love
Killer diller, killer love, killer diller
Killer love killer love
I wanna wo, I wanna wo, I wanna wo

My doctors on the phone
Asks me if I'm alone
Your heart is beating strong
But fever burns in your eyes
I'm concerned for you tonight

<i>[Chorus]</i>
