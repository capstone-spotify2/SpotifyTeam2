The sun shined on our face
Our imaginations took us to any place
At the end of that altered road
Where we all stop running
We were living without no plans
There was never a doubt that some day
One of us might shake hands with the devil
The other would not break free

What if we were young again, yeah
When all of the was just pretending

Everybody wants to move on, whoa
To a brand new thing
That doesn't mean that much to me
Everybody's singing along
To the song the other is singing, yeah
Because it's a brand new thing

The sun went by so fast
Caught up in something we thought would last
The hope grows cold
But the fire's still burning
Thinking about that time
Of giving up everything that was mine
I know that something tells me the end is near

What if we could start again, yeah
When all of this was just beginning

Everybody wants to move on, whoa
To a brand new thing
That doesn't mean that much to me
Everybody's singing along
To the song the other is singing, yeah
Because it's a brand new thing

We don't know
They will follow
They just know
They will follow
They just know
They will follow

Everybody wants to move on, whoa
To a brand new thing
That doesn't mean that much to me
Everybody's singing along
To the song the other is singing, yeah
Because it's a brand new thing
Everybody wants to move on, whoa (Everybody wants to move one)
Everybody's singing along (Everybody wants to move on)
Everybody wants to move on, whoa (Everybody wants to move one)
Everybody's singing along (Everybody wants to move on)
