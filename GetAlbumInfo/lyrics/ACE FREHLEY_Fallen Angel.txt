I know you've been up
I've seen you flyin'
Sometimes I'd wish
That you would fall down
I'm tired of your act
You're not even tryin'
Any dreams of hope
Dashed all away

(I'll) Take you down, so you can see
Take you down, what you've done to me
Take you down. your wanted by all below

Ooohhh fallen angel
Ooohhh fallen angel

Many times alone
I've been here waiting
(and) Many times again
I could not care less
(but) You've got a hold
And deep down I'm shakin'
But I won't let you make
A fool out of me

Ooohhh fallen angel
Ooohhh fallen angel
