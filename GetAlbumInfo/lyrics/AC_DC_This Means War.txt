Keep your head down

I
I want you
I want you to
I want you to march
Eyes goes right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids

When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
The treaty gone, see the bandits fly
Dig the trench, watch the blast
Shell shock come, coming fast
Name and rank, on parade
We might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means
Do you know what it means
This
Means
War
This means war
This means war
This means war
I said this means war
This means war
This means war
The bullet got your number on it
Run for cover
Hit the dirt
Call for your mother
Yeah
I
I need you
I need you to
I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull, dead to rights
Volunteer, one pace back
On the beach
Ain't no place for kids
Well the flack is high on the bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack ack gun
The fire rage and your in a blitz
Keep your head or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
We might get laid by a hand grenade
You know what it means
Do you know what it means
This
Means
War

Who go there is it friend or foe
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
And the peace talks die in Geneva town
Do you know what it means
Do you know what it means
Do you know what it means
Do you know what it means
This
Means war
This
Means war
I said this means war
This means war
This
Means war
Where's the 7th Calvary

This means war, told you before
I said this
Means war, you know the score
I said this means war
This means war
This
Means
War

You're all dead
