This oneâs for you and me
Living out our dreams
Weâre all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards mess my world up
If I was you I would duck or get struck like lighting
Fighters keep fighting
Put your lighters up point em' skyward UH!
Had a dream I was king I woke up still king
This rap game's nipples is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even feels me till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the illest in this music
There is or there ever will be. Disagree? 
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing, to ever give up,
Only thing I ever gave ups using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head's too big for this building

This oneâs for you and me
Living out our dreams
Weâre all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

You and I
Know what itâs like
To be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight
We're alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine ya ya

Cause this oneâs for you and me
Living out our dreams
Weâre all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
