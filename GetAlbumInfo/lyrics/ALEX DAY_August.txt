August isn't far away
But I won't last the spring
August always has its place 
But I've got no way in
And everyone I've ever known
Is giving me a different 
Piece of that fuss
I'm out of ammo
Out of options
Out of hope
I'll ever be in your life

I will never see you
But that doesn't mean you're gone
I will never know you 
But I know that you'll live on
When all is done
Your day will come
As all things have their time
You'll come around by August
You just might not be mine.

I thought I had found a chance
An opportunity
But things don't always go to plan
And I'll be history
And all I am is opened up
Without a way of giving 
You what I'd like
I promise you will see the sun
Even if I'm not standing there by your side

I will never see you
But that doesn't mean you're gone
I will never know you 
But I know that you'll live on
When all is done
Your day will come
As all things have their time
You'll come around by August
You just might not be mine.
