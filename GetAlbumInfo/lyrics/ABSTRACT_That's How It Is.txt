It's funny how it all
Started with a vision
I was chillin' with my dogs
Trynna to talk to bitches
But them bitches blew me off
Now everything is different
Cause they wishing they could just give me a call
Guess that's how it is

When it's just a matter of time
Guess that's how it is
When they chose to ignore the signs
Guess that's how it is
When you make it and everybody that you knew or
Went to school with wants to suddenly come around
Guess that's how it is

What's that shit?
Nah what'd you say?
Oh, you swore you'd never see the day
Here's some shine for all the days that you people
Painted my skies gray
Front like shit don't get back to me
Think I don't know who backin' me
I can tell who speaks sincere to me
Hearing me
Fearing me
Damn I hope you are
I'll become that star
Going so damn hard
Flow like the Fountain of Youth
Fountain of truth
Given the game CPR
Bring it back to life, to afterlife
So hit the lights, I ain't even gotta tell you twice
We are the artist's so paint your life
Don't you worry about what other people's canvas' like
As far as we know, this life is as far as we go
I'd like to believe in a Heaven
And alternate ending
But I can't be sure
So I'mma just do what I can
Be a good person and do what I love
Came to the realization that what you work for is what you will become
I know it I've seen it, I mean, goddamnit I'll be it
Coming up they weren't supportive
Now I see 'em around and they making me nervous
Shaking my hand like a whole other person
Tryna act like we all cool
Like this what a little bit of shine do
A couple blog posts, A couple million views

Nah, I ain't made it yet
Lots to do before I claim it yet
But I can see some people changing
I ain't even getting paper yet
Show you this ain't overnight
On my grind like an overbite
Fly on the wall 'till I hit the web
These bloodsuckers wanna see me dead
My real friends wanna see me win
Y'all know that I fuck with them
Down with those chasing passions
And not just drinks in they glasses
Know some who stuck in distractions cause it's a plan that they lacking
They see me chasing a dream and I feel their hate's automatic
That's messed up, that's jealousy, that's not a reason to not fuck with me
Acting weird around the kid cause you know we about to do it big
Instead of hating on the shit
I invite to come along
Instead of thinking you to cool
I invite you to sing along
Cause this EP about to be droppin'
And when it does hope that you cop it
Cause we have been working to long and to hard to ever be thinking of stopping
But people come and people go
Things change just to help us grow
These days I ain't one to stump
But some tracks you gotta let 'em know
