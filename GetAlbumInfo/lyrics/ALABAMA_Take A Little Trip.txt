If we could leave this ol' city
And head for the cabin we love
Back deep in the woods
Woah, baby we would
If we could jump some big ol' jet plane
And head for the islands
Where the weather is always good
Oh, don't you know we would

Well we can't do this and we can't do that
But baby we can stay right where we're at
Take a little trip, take a little trip
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight
Take a little time leave it all behind
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight

We could go down town to a nightclub
And dance to the rhythm of the music
On that old hardwood
Woah, baby we could
We could call up Rita and Bobby
And see what they're doing tonight
And maybe play some rook
Yeah, baby we could

Yeah, now we can do this or we can do that
Or baby we can stay right where we're at
Take a little trip, take a little trip
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight
Take a little time leave it all behind
Take a little trip you and me out of sight

Pull down the shades turn out the lights
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight
Take a little trip, take a little trip
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight
(Take a little) Take a little trip
(Take a little trip) Me and you me out of sight

Pull down the shades turn out the lights
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight...
