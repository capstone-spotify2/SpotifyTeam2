<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I'm a lady that comes with no chances
That means if I spot a sign of trouble your gone
To many times before, seemed I always played the fool
How was I to know, I was young and Gullible
I let the guys play my heart as if it was a toy
I got respect for me, now is a new day

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
I'm gonna let you play the games on me
Because I got a better strategy
And if you ever cause depression whoa,
Then you'sa gotta go, go, go

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'ma fight the tears so my make-up, don't mess up
And I'ma fight the feelings I be wantin to call you
And I'ma fight you back, if you ever step to me,
Closin up the doors
Made it clear before, 
Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Don't get me wrong I don't hate men,
I love 'em, but I just think that some should stop their problems
Some are confusers, users, abusers, 
Some are just plain 'ol losers
Boy your silly games won't get away with me
I'm not the foolish girly that I used to be
Chuck it out the window, just like that
If your head is 'posed to be where it's at
R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Respect, I suggest you find out what it means

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'ma fight the tears so my make-up, don't mess up
And I'ma fight the feelings I be wantin to call you
And I'ma fight you back, if you ever step to me,
Closin up the doors
Made it clear before, 
Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I am disappointed 'bout the way you treaten me
You're just another boot from the river
I'll find a better lover
Theres fishes in the sea
I'll keep on tryin yes, 'cause I'm a fighter yo
I got your number already, I'm a fighter yo
No need to cry no more, already felt this before
I'm a fighter and I ain't 'gon take you back fo'sho

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'ma fight the tears so my make-up, don't mess up
And I'ma fight the feelings I be wantin to call you
And I'ma fight you back, if you ever step to me,
Closin up the doors
Made it clear before, 
Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)

I'll keep on tryin yes, 'cause I'm a fighter yo
I got your number already, I'm a fighter yo
No need to cry no more, already felt this before
I'm a fighter and I ain't 'gon take you back fo'sho
<i>[x2]</i>

'Cause I'm a fighter
'Cause I'm a fighter
