I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
Always find a way to win, I told you niggas to begin
I was ready I was holding steady niggas tryna bring me to an end
Nah, I will not let it go, know that I'm taking it personal
Currently life is a roller coaster, I let it out at the studio
All of the shit that I deal with, making me stronger to push through
Mentally niggas are bulletproof, first they gon' love you then ridicule
That's just the way that the game go, this is the shit I was made for
This is the vision and God's will, I am the legend a pioneer
Know I'm a claim and defend mine, after the rain always sunshine
We on the grind til' it's our time, you can just <i>[?]</i>
I run my city like combines, G Money whipping that 99
We coming straight out the 95, four in the morning in foreign rides
I'm in the coupe with a thick jawn, I gave her something to feel on
She 'bout to enter the kill zone, I might disable her hip bone
I got the key to the beat, I got the key to the streets
I got the key to the Porsche, I haven't driven in weeks
Shout to Ghost never had a doubt, never did count me out
It's some days, feeling so empty I'm tryna motivate my mind
In due time I'm a jump back just fine, never let 'em take my shine
Oh you mad? niggas better get in that line
Pulling up in a new ride
I told my niggas I want it bad, funny I'm not even in my bag
I see the vision they come to pass, I love my niggas forever facts
We tryna run it then run it back, I fuck up a beat in a heart attack
Them haters I dodge 'em like Pontiac
Aye this where I bring in the chorus at

<i>[Takeoff &amp; Trouble:]</i>
I got the key to the streets my nigga
Just like Dr. Dre, he got the beats
I come straight up out of 1500
That's the block, my niggas over easy
Double cup but no ice tea
Pour me a four before I go to sleep
Fuck around and landed in the hospital
Geekin' off the Henn and the lean
(Takeoff!)
(Sup Skoob!)
(Go head, take off)
24/7, no day off, balling like we in the playoffs
20 bitches at the playhouse
You quick to freeze up when that K out
If that bitch ain't tryna fuck I kick her out the house
Like Martin, lil bitty bitch stay out
They like to whoop me 'til them Ks out
Get to looking for some ways out
You niggas ain't workin', you're laid off
Trouble decapitate him, blow his face off
Won't get it 'til these niggas laid off
Assassinating, knock him off like I'm Adolf
Been getting money, 19 with a 650
Nut seen me stunting B.I.P Blood
