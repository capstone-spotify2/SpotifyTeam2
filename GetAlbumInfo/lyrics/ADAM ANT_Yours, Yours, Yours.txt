A love dare not speakin' the name
A love dare not speakin' the

I will love you each day of my life
And when I die they can
Fetch them a knife
Cut me open
And written on my brain
And in my heart they'll find a name
It'll be yours, yours, yours, yours

A love dare not speakin' the name
A love dare not speakin' the 

If you wanna be happy
Live out of the past
Make your new lover
As good as the last
Or better...

I will love you each day of my life
And when I die they can
Fetch them a knife
Cut me open
Written on my brain
And in my heart they'll find a name
It'll be yours, yours, yours, yours

A love dare not speakin' the name
A love dare not speakin' the 

If you wanna be happy
Live out of the past
Make your new lover
As good as the last
Or better...

A love dare not speakin' the name
A love dare not speakin' the 

Please don't love me
For what I'm not
Better you hate me
For what I've got
