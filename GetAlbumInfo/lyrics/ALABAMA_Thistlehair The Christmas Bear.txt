The city's full of manger scenes
And stores lit up in red and green.
But down the road just out of town
There's more magic to be found.
The countryside is all a-glow
With holly trees and mistletoe.
And in them woods there lives a bear
Known to all as Thistlehair.

Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair

He comes around this time of year
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer.
The kids all love this shiny coat
And the smell of honey on his nose.
He tells them all about that star
And everything that it stands for.
The birthday we all celebrate
Is still our favorite holiday

Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair

Wherever you find old Thistlebear
There'll be music in the air.
He dances 'round the Christmas tree
Every single New Year's eve.
Then he and all his furry friends
Gather 'Round the fire again
Singin' 'Bout those Angels' wings
Gifts of love that Christmas brings.

Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair

Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere...
