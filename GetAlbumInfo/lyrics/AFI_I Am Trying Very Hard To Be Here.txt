Before you came, what was your name?
Did you look like me?
No one's from here, no one, my dear
Not even the trees

So change your name
Just keep your face
We're temporary anyway
Before you came we played this game
In our masquerade

(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Quick now, quick)
Take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Whoa-oh)
Whoa-oh-oh!

What was your past?
When was the last time that you recall
Someone you knew was someone who
Asked nothing of you

So lose your past
I'm sure you'll find
It's in the way
All the time
Before you're through you're someone who
Looks a lot like you

(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Quick now, quick)
Take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Whoa-oh)
Whoa-oh-oh!

We can't, can't remember the seasons
We chant in the manmade snow
We can't, can't recall the feelings that
We cannot show
Oh!
(Whoa-oh)
(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Quick now, quick)
Take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Whoa-oh)
Whoa-oh!

(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
Quick now, quick
Take our picture
(Flash, flash, car crash)
We're no fixtures
(Whoa-oh)
Whoa-oh-oh!
(Hey, hey)
Oh!
