Can we freeze karma and surrender our rights and wrongs
Can we just for a night let the stars decide where we belong
Maybe heaven right now is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you
I will find you
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Yeah

I will lose my mind
Yeah
Lose my mind
Yeah

Maybe heaven right now is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you,
I will find you,
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
Lose my mind
I will lose my mind
Yeahhh
Lose my mind
Yeahhhh
