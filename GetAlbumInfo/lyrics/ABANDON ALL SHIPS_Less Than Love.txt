You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you.
When will we be together?

Attention seeker
You're a firm believer
In more then one
Pray the right will come
Close your eyes
Say your goodbyes
To real love
He's not that one you're dreaming of
Well, I hate to break it to you
You're just some fucking slut
Close your eyes
Say your goodbyes

Your negatives exposed, the pictures they stay the same
So hold your head down low, you're the only one to blame.

Bitch they're laughing at you
They don't hear your prayers
You think they're smiling at you?
They don't see you there
Attraction fades from the love you seek
Attention aids your failed technique
Close your eyes
Say your good byes.

Your negatives exposed, the pictures they stay the same
So hold your head down low, you're the only one to blame.

You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you?
When will we be together?
You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you?
I pray we end up together
