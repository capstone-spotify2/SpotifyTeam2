She used to get her fix with just one little kiss or touch
Could send her over the edge
I keep her up making love all night, had the stuff to make her feel alright
But now she won't go near that ledge.

She don't get high anymore,
I don't make her fly like before,
Her heart is out there soaring somewhere else
I'm not the song that she sings,
I can't give her those wings
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for
She don't get high anymore.

I remember when she used to breathe me in
Back then, she couldn't get enough.
We'd lay looking out at the clouds, I thought we never come down
She said my love was like some kind of drug.

But she don't get high anymore,
I don't make her fly like before,
Her heart is out there soaring somewhere else
I'm not the dream that she dreams,
I can't give her those wings.
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for,
She don't get high anymore.

Oh, I'm not the song that she sings
I can't give her those wings
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for,
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high
Anymore.
She don't get high, she don't get high...
