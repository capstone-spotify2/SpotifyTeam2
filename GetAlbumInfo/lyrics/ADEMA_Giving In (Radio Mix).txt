Will you walk me
To the edge again
Shaking lonely
And I am drinking again
Woke up tonight
And no one's here with me
I'm giving in to you

Take me under, I'm giving in to you, I'm dying tonight, I'm giving in to you
Watch me crumble, I'm giving in to you, I'm crying tonight, I'm giving in to you

Caught up in life
Losing all my friends
Family has tried
To heal all my addictions
Tragic it seems to be alone again
I'm giving in to you

Take me under, I'm giving in to you, I'm dying tonight, I'm giving in to you
Watch me crumble, I'm giving in to you, I'm crying tonight, I'm giving in to you

I look forward to dying tonight
Drink 'til I'm myself
Life's harder everyday
The stress has got me
I'm giving in, I'm giving in, giving in, NO:

(I'm killing all the pain)

Take me under, I'm giving in to you, I'm dying tonight, I'm giving in to you
Watch me crumble, I'm giving in to you, I'm crying tonight, I'm giving in to you
