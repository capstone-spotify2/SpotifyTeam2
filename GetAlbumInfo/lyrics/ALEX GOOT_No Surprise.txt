So hold me now beside your possessions with no value.
And bring me up beside your life that goes on without you
If I could just speak my mind we could stop wasting our time
(our time)

Every single moment I will need to
(just take it all without a fight)
Reiterate that I believe you
(when is it wrong or is it right?)
(whoa) I just want to know

Ill bring myself down
And they'll laugh as I slowly give up all hope
Of ever seeing the light of your eyes again
And take it back to the way it was

Every single moment I will need to
(just take it all without a fight)
Reiterate that I believe you
(when is it wrong or is it right?)
(whoa) I just want to know

I'm on my knees begging for you to come back please
I know that you're well aware.
No surprises, please, surprise me and take me back again
(did you really think that you would get away with it? 
Could you possibly think that you would get away with it?)

Every single moment I will need to
(just take it all without a fight)
Reiterate that I believe you
(when is it wrong or is it right?)
(whoa) I just want to know
