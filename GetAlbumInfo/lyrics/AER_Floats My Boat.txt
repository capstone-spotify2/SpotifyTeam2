<i>[Hook x2 â Dave:]</i>
Blow my smoke in the sky
Still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettinâ high
Sippin' on my SoCo
Live it up till Iâm dead
Ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are
I do what floats my boat

<i>[Verse 1 â Carter:]</i>
I be after that half and half Arnold Palmer tea
I got your girl callinâ told me meet me at the beach
Iâm hootinâ hollering at main street of the colony
Starlight was bright with her last night
Now sheâs calling me
The rules might bend or break
Thatâll remain hidden
Like Roo throwin' down when Maryâs away on business
Back deck stairs flower dress long hair
Blurred nights but we still takin' care we rep the FAM
Wake up way too early get some and food and dine and dash
Too hungover to know the difference between this and that
Focused on how to open her up but approach her with class
Weekends lose their meaning, every evening like the last

<i>[Hook x2]</i>

<i>[Carter:]</i>
I can keep up with the tempo
Thatâs right, heâs right, alright, letâs ride
Now what you tryna get into
Lets find some time tonight

Yeah and Roo didn't forget to pick up the 750 of dry gin from fifth ave liquors
Us kids are wavy waving at sweeties on the street
Sticker slap the FAM logo right upon the damn hood of a jeep
No cloud in the sky
But clouds in my mind
She with another man not wonderin' why
Comfortable surrounding never not a full stride
Weâll see your ass tomorrow so donât call it goodbye

<i>[Hook x2]</i>

<i>[Carter:]</i>
I can keep up with the tempo
Thatâs right, heâs right, alright, letâs ride
Now what you tryna get into
Lets find some time tonight

Whats up ladies and gentlemen, this is the bright side, bring your friends, and shut it down
I hope everyone's havin' a good time playin' it in summer of 2012
If its summer of 2040, play this shit a little bit louder
Cuz we makin' timeless music man this is the fresh Aer movement
And if you donât fuck with us thatâs fine
