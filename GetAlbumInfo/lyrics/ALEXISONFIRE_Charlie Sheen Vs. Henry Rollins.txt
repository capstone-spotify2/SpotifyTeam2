There's four cruisers flashing in my rear view, 
And they're not gonna take me out. Iâd watch it. What'd you do now? 
There's four cruisers weighing on my conscience. 
There is one thing for sure, this is not a fucking love song. 

My fear is gone, and still I don't know why, 
I waited for so long to let you know. (I'm not goin' back!) 
Now this is all your fault and thereâs no one left to blame. 
Did you think weâd make it out? Did you know? 

Do you know? 
Oh, yeah! 

Somewhere out there, thereâs a man on the ground who ain't livin' anymore. 
And his name is written on my knuckles. Take me. Take my fuckin' burden. 

There's four cruisers flashing in my rear view, 
They're never gonna take me out. I'd watch it. What'd you do? 
In each cruiser is a man with his gun, 
And his fancy little bullets with my name on 'em. 

My fear is gone, and still I don't know why, 
I waited for so long to let you know. (I'm not goin' back!) 
Now this was all your fault and thereâs no one left to blame. 
Did you even think this out? Did you know? 

Hey hey, ho ho! 
Wild chase to the open road. 
Hey hey, ho ho! 
This car is too fuckin' slow. 

I don't know where I'm going but I'm not slowing down. 
And I'll die before I stop this fuckin' car. 
Street lights and white lines. 
This is all I have left. This is all I have! 

Flashing lights and racing hearts. 
Will you ever just slow down? 
How did we end up here? 
And all those sirens are getting louder. 
Flashing lights and racing hearts. 
I don't think we're gonna make it out. 
This won't end well. (...make it out...) 
This won't end well.
