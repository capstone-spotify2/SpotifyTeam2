There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me

Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name

And there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you

Well I think you're playin' with me darlin'
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin' for Blue Marlin
Instead of bein' hooked by again by you

But there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you

Yeah there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Yeah there goes my heart fallin' for you
