In the imperium with emerald valleys
There where endlessness encircles you

A goddess lost her aureole
Created her own domain

This valley of doom where I'm the token
She'll be throwing the dice this time

A goddess lost her aureole
Evil took over her godless soul
Swallowing you in the rivers of blood
Morbid games played with you, you token

Clouds are roaming around the pale moon
An inimical gloom covers the valleys
I'm the cephalic empress of this doomed celestial empire
Hear the orchestra of death

I wade in blood in search for my inevitable death
The dice are rolling now
