Dearest love, I hope this finds you well
I am kidding this is probably hell
Lonely stranger with a brush in hand
Never saw me sneaking up on him
Tonight say goodbye to what you thought you knew
Theyâll blame the blood spilled on you
Iâm closing my eyes, one more kiss before I never wake again

Two moves ahead of you
You are a pawn
Castle now but Iâm behind your king
As your queen lays bleeding on the board
Accept you have lost the game, misjudged your enemy

Unleash the myth living in your worst fears
Iâm trapped! Donât wait!

Page abandoned, the stories write themselves
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the worldâs collide
The story is ending

Would you remember Joan of Arc was her flesh yet unlicked by flame?
Will you remember how the waves crash on the shores of time?
Who wouldâve ever known that each choice made sense?
Who couldâve ever known?
Are we not our actions?
Our lives are poetry, make them sonnets

Unleash the myth living in your worst fears
Iâm trapped! Donât wait!

Page abandoned, the stories write themselves
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the worldâs collide
The story is ending

Why do the floorboards creak like a heartbeat
This room is driving me insane
Whatâs behind the bricks?
Whoâs rapping at my chamber door?
Pendulum, why do you torment me?
What am I saying? Have I lost my mind?

I am her!

No longer Fatima, goddess, light
Iâve become Rusalka, demon of night!

Two moves ahead of you
You are a pawn
Castle now but Iâm behind your king
As your queen lays bleeding on the board
Accept you have lost the game, misjudged your enemy

Donât wait...

Page abandoned, the stories write themselves
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the worldâs collide
Page abandoned, time is ending
The story is ending, make them sonnets
We sit and watch the worldâs collide

The night that I died I had become Rusalka. I was no longer me. I was no longer Annabel. The beautiful evil coursed through my veins and I saw so clearly what needed to be done. As you lay, fast asleep, I penned her farewell and kissed your cheek. The knife felt so light in my hand, so heavy in my stomach. There is something about this roomâ¦
