The times that we had yeah they were memorable
And yeah the chance of us together was improbable
but I took a chance for you and everything that I've done
Was for you to be happy
I wanted to be your only one
I remember we'd talk every night
Loving every millisecond yeah I knew this was right
We talked about being perfect in this cold dark world
But now your truth is finally told
Ohhh oh I asked if you were sure
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh well I guess you didn't want it anymore
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I kinda had a feeling that in the end
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh That you'd chose to just be my friend
Just to be my friend
Hope that you still care and that you still think about me
You know I think of you every night in my dreams

I really didn't mean to make things end up like this
And now I'm sitting here still in the cold lonely mist
Ohhh oh I asked if you were sure
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh well I guess you didn't want it anymore
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I kinda had a feeling that in the end
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh you'd chose to just be my friend
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh You just say that you care
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I remember all that we share
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh Stuck in 100 problems
Ohhh Ohhh Didn't have to end up this way
No it didn't have to end up this way
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh Ohhhh oh
