There were times I stood my ground
When I knew you were right
Turned around and walked away
When I should've held you tight
But you never closed the door
You just turned out the light
Gave me time to think it over
A chance to make it right

Sometimes out of touch
But never out of love
Sometimes giving in
But never giving up
We've been worlds apart
Yet always close enough
Yeah, we've been out of touch
But never out of love

No matter how we try
There still may come a time
When our minds are far apart
But I know you and me
Will always find a way to be
Together in our hearts

Sometimes out of touch
But never out of love
Sometimes giving in
Oh, but never giving up
We've been worlds apart
Yet always close enough
Yeah, we've been out of touch
But never out of love

Yeah, we've been out of touch
But never out of love...
