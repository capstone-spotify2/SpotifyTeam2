Im sitting here lookin at your body 
baby baby baby
I've never seen something so beautiful here 
lately lately lately
I love the way the candles are bringing out ur skin tone 
baby baby baby
Dont ever put ur clothes on again stay buttnaked 
baby baby baby

I love the way u sound 
When i let you in
That sweet low moaning
(you look so good imma sing it again)
