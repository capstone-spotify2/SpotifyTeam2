Someone wrote just yesterday
"Love's in need of love today"
Will there be none tomorrow

Faded feelings, jaded news
Where's the tender hearts
that love romance, they
seem so few

So, I write these words to say
Take heart have faith
in love's tomorrow
Where our precious dreams
will all come true

Heaven knows what I've
been through
searching for a heart that's true
Is there one in a million?

Though I've often failed the test
Everyone must journey till
that questioning is through

Shine a star for me to see what
children see on Christmas morning
Every hope and dream
to be renewed

Heaven only knows how I hope
that chance of love is higher
than one in a million

I'm a dreamer I confess
but my dreams are only of
the best that we can do

So, I'll keep on counting sheep
and will not sleep until the dawning

Help me break the news, eternal
love just beat the blues

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Save me from no love
(you oughta save me)
Save me from no love
Say sweet love has come
and is not gone,
there is all, that I want,
this morning

Save me from no love
(you oughta save me)
Save me from no love
Say sweet love has come
and will live on,
Never gone, ever on,
(strong), eternally (forever)

Now I've done the best I can, girl
I need a helping hand
Are you one in a million?

People leave without good-byes
Stay with me, for through your
eyes I see another truth

You're the star and now I see what
children see on Christmas morning

Stay and see it through the gift
of love returned to you

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

I'm searchin' for love, baby,
been lookin' today
somewhere there's a love, baby,
do you know the way?

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>

Save me, save me
You've got to save me
Save me, save me
Baby, you can save me
Save me, save me
You've got to save me
from no love
