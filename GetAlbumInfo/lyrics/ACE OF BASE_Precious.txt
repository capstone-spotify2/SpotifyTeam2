L'autre jour dans un bosquet,
Il me ceuilloit un bouquet;
Il en orna ma boulette,
Me disant: belle brunette,
Flore est moins belle que toi:
L'amour moins tendre que moi.

I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
His pick-up line decieving you
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing

Play after play, they buy his double play
He's down at the fiesta, where people get together
Taste that bitter sweet surprise
Appreciate your heart and your soul has been revised

I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
His pick-up line decieving you
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing

Wave after wave, they fall for his behavior
A gentle whisper and they crave - he is so depraved
Taste that bitter sweet surprise
Appreciate your heart and your soul has been revised

I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
His pick-up line decieving you
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing

Now night falls and you feel so lonely (and you feel so lonely)
Because you're the only (only one)
Hey little diamond, dreams are forever
You will endeavour more than memories

L'autre jour dans un bosquet,
Il me ceuilloit un bouquet;
Il en orna ma boulette,
Me disant: belle brunette,
Flore est moins belle que toi:
L'amour moins tendre que moi

I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
His pick-up line decieving you
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing

I say love, love, love is all around
Take us with us a common ground
I say love, love, love is all around
That's the foot print of who we are
