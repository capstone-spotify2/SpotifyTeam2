Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
You've got to make a serious decision.

It could be me up there in stage lights.
It could be me on the TV in you living room.
It could be me jet setting with my band all across the world.
Appearing live in concert one night only, tickets sold out.

Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
You've got to make a serious decision.

There I am giving candid disclosure to press in interview.
There I go on my way through the crowd up to the podium.
On behalf of our fans we'd like to accept this award.
Smile for the camera boys, gold record in hand.

Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
You've got to make a serious decision.

All of our lives in waiting.
All of our lives traded for their roses and applause.
All of our lives dedicated to shoving it right back in their fucking face.

Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
Stop! Take some time to think, figure out what's important to you.
You've got to make a serious decision.
I said you've got to make a serious decision.

Stop! Take some time to think.
