What if there was no hell,
What if there was no heaven to sell?
What if we were slaves to breed,
What if you drank this cup half fucked?
Iâm half relieved
Iâm dying to hear you breathe,
Are you dying to take a breath?

Hold on between ugly
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of death
I will fear no life, fear no evil.
You laugh all the way to the bank.

What if you were sold beliefs,
What if abandoned hearts killed earth save luxury?
Iâm dying to hear you breathe,
Are you dying to take a breath?

Hold on between ugly
As I walk through the valley in the shadow of death
I will fear no life, fear no evil.
You laugh all the way to the bank.
