Oh, my love, oh, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
I just had to tell you that

Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
I'll be comin' home, wait for me
Please, baby, let me say

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to, to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me
