When I wake up in the sunlight
And look into your eyes
And I hold you for a little while
and I see behind your smile
I remember how beautiful I used to think you are
Now the only love that meant something is gone

I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you 
I'll be better on my own
Now, I miss the sun, but as long as I'm with you
It's just another rainy day in London
It's just another rainy day in London

I still hold onto the memory of how we were meant to be
And I wonder did you ever care
You were never there for me
I thought I was stronger
But then why am I here when there's nothing left to say
Now the only love that meant something is gone...

I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you 
I'll be better on my own
Now, I miss the sun, but as long as I'm with you
It's just another rainy day in London
It's just another rainy day in London

<i>[Instrumental Break]</i>

I remember how beautiful I used to think you are...

I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you 
I'll be better on my own
Now, I miss the sun, but as long as I'm with you
It's just another rainy day in London
It's just another rainy day in London
