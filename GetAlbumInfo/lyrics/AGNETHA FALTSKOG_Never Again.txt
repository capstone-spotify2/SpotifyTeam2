Our nights are over,
It's just a long flight home,
The last touch in the morning
Is forever gone,
Mmm, oh baby, I want to hold you once again
Mmm, baby, it would never be the same.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,
Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.

Tomorrow's waiting,
It's time for me to go,
You don't have to say a thing
'Cause we will always know,
Mmm, oh baby, we were lovers with a smile
Yeah, baby, we had it all for a little while.

<i>[Chorus x3]</i>

Never again, ohhhh...
