Take me back to the start
Before we ever fell apart
I was there, you were there
And the feeling was strong
Who will save my heart and soul
It's not about where you've been
Or even who you know
So let me in, and just let it go
And the feeling was strong

Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
You've got a shoulder to cry on
It's what we rely on

Hear me now, or curse my name
Just wanted to see if you're okay
I was there, you were there
But the feeling was gone
Who will save my heart and soul
All the way from Paris back to Tokyo
Like mama said, it was the worst of all
But the feeling was gone

Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
You've got a shoulder to cry on
It's what we rely on

Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
Don't look, it's gone
