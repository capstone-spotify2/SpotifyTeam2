You are the one who has done me
Guess you knew from the start
I call again, but there's no one in
Don't know where, with whom you've 
been

But I do
Love you
Anyway you want me to

You are the one...now the state I'm in!
Catching you was so hard
I fought for you, did you let me win!?
Don't even care, don't care
Where I've been

But I do
Love you
Anyway you want me to

I've done all I can do
All the letters...I've sent through
Put my life in the palms of your hands
Maybe now you can see
That it's got to be me
But if you leave me
I'll understand, yeah
If you leave me, I'll understand

You are the one who has done me
Guess you knew from the start
I call your friends, but there's no one 
in
Catching you is so hard
You are the one!
