She's always home by 1 A.M
She only sees me as a friend
Never been touched, of that I'm sure
She's just simple innocent girl, religious girl
Religious girl, religious girl, religious girl

<i>[Chorus: (2x)]</i>
Dancing in the moonlight, celebrating all night
Trust your feelings, girl and lose control
Shameless swimming naked, making love not fake it
Face the consequences later on...

She is the daughter of the priest
Can go to hell cause we just kissed
I've never been in love before
With such a simple innocent girl
Religious girl, religious girl, religious girl, religious girl

<i>[Chorus: (4x)]</i>
Dancing in the moonlight, celebrating all night
Trust your feelings, girl and lose control
Shameless swimming naked, making love not fake it
Face the consequences later on...

Religious girl, religious girl, religious girl, religious girl.
