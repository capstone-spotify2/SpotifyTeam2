My angel close your eyes, I'll be your lover tonight.
Pitiful lullaby, I'll be your lover tonight.

My own misery is taunting me.
The air stings my lungs, I can barely see.
Wicked eyes surrounding me, the trees are watching silently.
I could try to run but baby what's the point?

I may never know
(I don't see the point.)
Why I let you go.

My body is aching.
I'm losing my mind!
There's nothing to hold onto.
My angel close your eyes, I'll be your lover tonight.
I'm tired of trying.
I'm sick of the waiting!
If there's nothing that I can do.
A pitiful lullaby to sing the tortured to sleep

We could settle down and change the end.
Nothing but time, start over again.
All the little things you do that make me fall in love with you.
Have led me to this, a bittersweet abyss.

I may never know
(A vexatious kiss.)
Why I let you go.

My body is aching.
I'm losing my mind!
There's nothing to hold onto.
My angel close your eyes, I'll be your lover tonight.
I'm tired of trying.
I'm sick of the waiting!
If there's nothing that I can do.
A pitiful lullaby to sing the tortured to sleep

I will follow you into the night my darling eyes.
I would do anything to be lying with you as I watch you dream.

I have been reborn!
I have broken free! I'm free! I'm free!
You can't deny me, do not defy me!
I'm drunk on lust and sovereignty!
Abandon all hope for beyond time I can stand!
I have been reborn!
Darling, tonight we say goodbye!
Sing a touching lullaby and we'll watch the angels cry.
