Why don't you come to me? 
Why don't you realize? 
My heart is breaking up. 
My heart is breaking up. 
Where are you coming from? 
Why did you compromise? 
I don't believe in that. 
I don't believe in that. 
I could just let you fall. 
I could just watch you drown.

Why would you want to pull away? 
Why would you want to lose that joy? 
I don't believe in that. 
I don't believe in that. 
You know how your life has been before. 
You know that emptiness won't cease. 
I don't believe in that. 
I don't believe in that. 
I can't just let you fall, 
I can't just watch you drown. 
And I know you will see what he has planned. 
I know you'll see what you have done. 
It's hard to see the path to take, 
but you know the truth. 
Why don't you open up your eyes take a deep look inside your heart, 
mine hurts because you walked away. 
Why don't you open up your eyes, 
take a deep look inside your heart, 
mine hurts because you walked away..
