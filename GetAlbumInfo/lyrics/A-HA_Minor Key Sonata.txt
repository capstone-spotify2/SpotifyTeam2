Come back, my darling one 
I'm calling on you 
The road ahead is long 
And I must warn you 
Take hold, my little one 

My minor key sonata 
Show forth your looping grace 
No one here can take your place 
Weâll find a way 
To make it pay 
To get around it 
Come back, my fallen son 

Don't let them fool you 
Cos when the day is done 
They never move you 
Lay down your sense of pride 
Trampled once too often 
Put out your mournful tones 
No one here can take your place 

Weâll find a way 
To do OK 
To get around it 

Come back, my analogue 
I hardly knew ya 
The high end sloping off 
A thing of beauty 
Take hold, my little ones 
My minor key sonatas 

Show forth your looping grace 
No one here can take your place 
Weâll make it pay 
Weâll find a way 
To do without it 
Say 

Youâll find a way 
Weâll make it pay 
To get around it 

Show 
Just what you know 
Just let it go 
To get around it
