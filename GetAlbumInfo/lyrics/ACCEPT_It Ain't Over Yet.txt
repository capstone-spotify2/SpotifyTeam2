Why would you leave me - I will never understand
I'm searchin' for a reason
You gotta stop messin' with my mind
Messin' with my head

I can not believe you - walkin' out on me at all
I've always been your backbone
I was there to catch your fall

I don't believe it - it just ain't over yet
It ain't over yet
I don't believe it - it just ain't over yet

It might be wishful thinking - you would change your mind
A voice in my soul says no - you're not the kind
The power of illusion
Keeps me going every day
I've got no explanation
How can I make you stay - it just ain't over yet

Ain't over vet
I don't believe it - it just ain't aver yet
