Look out, look out, Phoenix cried
My time must be at hand
I'm feeling cold and I don't know why
The ground moves where I stand.

All the lies she gave to me
In words that twist and bend
Now the only place for me
Is down in the swallow wind.

Far off and long ago
She came when I was young
A silver moon shining in her eyes
And strange the song she sang.

All so easy I trusted her
I thought she was my friend
Now the only place for me
Is down in the swallow wind.

And I don't really know what to tell you now
It's something I just can't control
I thought you wanted to take my love
Now you want my soul.

Last time I saw her
She was standing in the sand
The ashen moon was in her hair
And a cross was in her hand.

I'm sailing alone, she cried
Though I can't believe I sinned
Now the only place for me
Is down in the swallow wind.
