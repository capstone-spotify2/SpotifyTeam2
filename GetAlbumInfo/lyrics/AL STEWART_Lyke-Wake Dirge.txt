(This ae nighte, this ae nighte)
(Any nighte and alle)
(Fire and fleet and candle-lighte)
(And Christe receive thy saule)

When thou from hence away art past
Any nighte and alle
To Whinny-muir thou com'st at last
And Christe receive thy saule.

If thou gavest hosen and shoon
Any nighte and alle
And sit thee down and put them on
And Christe receive thy saule.

Well, if hosen and shoon thou ne'er gav'st nane
Any nighte and alle
The whinnes sall prick thee to the bare bane
And Christe receive thy saule.

From Brig o' Dread whence thou may'st pass
Any nighte and alle
To Purgatory fire thou com'st at last
And Christe receive thy saule.

If ever thou gav'st meat or drink
Any nighte and alle
The fire sall never make thee shrink
And Christe receive thy saule.

If meat or drink thou ne'er gav'st nane
Any nighte and alle
The fire will burn thee to the bare bane
And Christe receive thy saule.
