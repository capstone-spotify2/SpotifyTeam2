I wanna be the one that's catching all the luck
Sitting on a mountain of a million bucks
It's time I get a taste of the hollywood life
Sleeping all day and getting drunk all night
Can I be the one getting all the free shit
Hanging out with Hef and got my house on cribs
If I could have a chance to be living this way
I will show you all that I'm not the same

Famous for nothing,
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing,
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone

I wanna be the one with hundreds in my hand
Slipping right by the bitch doorman
It's time I start seeing things go my way
Sipping on some Jack and a bottle of Grey
Can I be the one with thirty-two cars
Sitting backstage with all the rockstars
I wanna be the one that told you so
Middle finger up screaming fuck the world

Famous for nothing,
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing,
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone

Famous for shit
Why don't you quit
You got it all so why can't I <i>[x2]</i>

Famous for nothing,
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing,
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone!
