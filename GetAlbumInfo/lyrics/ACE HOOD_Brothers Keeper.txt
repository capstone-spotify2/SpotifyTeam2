I'm my brother's keeper
I am my brother's keeper
And thou shalt not cross each other in the name of Jesus
And thou shalt not testify and go against yo people
And thou shalt not speak about it if you ain't never done it
Put God first and my family second, ain't nothing above it
I'm my brother's keeper
I am my brother's keeper

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I pledge allegiance, my brother's keeper til I'm death departed
My wheel out so yo bullshit will get disregarded
Get yo money dog and say fuck them niggas, cut they head regardless
And if you go to war then I'm going too, now it's gangsta party
And mama told me don't trust niggas cus they all jealous
And if you out of jail this early dawg then you probably tellin
Oh Lord, you lookin at one of the realest niggas you done ever seen
Only receive about 20 choppas for the whole team
Getting dirty money but my bitches clean, they like Listerine
Where I come from it's either fake or real, it's no in-between
An eye for an eye, all my niggas ride or die
All my niggas certified
Trill niggas recognize hah!

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
My best friend got killed probably bout a year ago
On his front porch for a bag of cake and some indigo
I was mad as hell, why the fuck he ain't keep that hammer close?
I should've been there, I should've gone with him when he had to go
Cus this cold world that we livin in it's like 3 below
And I'll be goddamned if I'll bury any another of my nigas, no
In my home town I had downtown, I've been plottin plenty
And if you with a real nigga on some real shit you won't understand it
I'm against the wall, I gotta make some calls, them niggas broke the law
I'm in the blue sedan, I got the tool in hand and they comin to talk
What's the word homie? All my niggas ride or die
Niggas ain't safe when them Haitian boys done come drive-by
