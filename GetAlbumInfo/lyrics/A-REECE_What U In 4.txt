I got a list of mammies I'm out to get once I'm outta this
Neighborhood
Tryna take em all for this mile and shit
I wanna fuck em all, if they taking, I'll take em out of it
I'm just a young nigga infatuated by women, its hard to get their attention
When you broke, ain't got a whip, ain't got a crib, or let alone an iPhone 6
Trust me I know this
FACTS
These bitches buy the album
The niggas burn it
So I prefer the former outcome
And I'll deserve it
Look
I rap to impress
Finesse
You can stay with you underground connect
Cause I don't wena starve nigga
These girls want a superstar nigga
Reinvent yourself or get a job nigga
Move along nigga
You decide what you in it for
You decide who you do it for
Is it either or
I just wanna know
(I just wanna know, I just know)

Are you in it for the bitches
Are you in it for the riches
Are you in it for the long run
And be the greatest man who ever did it

Money is not an option its obvious that its mandatory
Don't keep the change, I need it
Let's see if all that fame is gon feed em
Late at night I'm always fighting my demons
They say money is the root of all evil, its so hard to believe em
But a blessing it would be if I was offered Madibas
I get it though its never that easy
All I got is this music
Do everything I can to improve it
I'm done with school
I got no excuses
I gotta prove it
I rap for the cheques, pay debts
You can stay with the bitches, we can bet
They gon follow once the money is up
Pussy chasing is just not for us
A lot of it is just never enough
I die for my cut
You decide what you in it for
You decide who you do it for
Is it either or
I just wanna know
(I just wanna know, I just wanna know)

Are you in it for the bitches
Are you in it for the riches
Are you in it for the long run
And be the greatest man who ever did it

I'm no HHP, no Tumi, I'm no Zeus
I'm no Proverb, not even Pro on ProTools
I'm not Reason, I'm no Khuli, no Keirnan too
I'm not new to this I won't settle for number 2
I ain't just a rapper doin it cause someone did it
I ain't in this just to follow fluid
I'm in this shit because I got influenced
I'm in this shit so I could school the students
I'm in this shit so I can teach their tutors
I've been the shit
I thought you knew this
Man I rap to be the best,I'm the next
I'm an eagle flying high,they just birds in a nest
I'm on the court hogging on the ball
I want it all
Its ok to loose a battle
I'm just trying to win the war and be a god Nigga
You decide what you in it for
You decide who you do it for
