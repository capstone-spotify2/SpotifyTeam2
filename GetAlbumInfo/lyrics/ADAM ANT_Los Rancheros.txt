Oi Oi Oi!
A few dollars more
They'll hang me high
But still me spirit
Will survive

There's money over there
But not for long
Soon my worries
Will be gone

Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros

Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros

And there's a bullet with my name on it

Time's-a-coming
When a new breed say
Welcome tomorrow
Instead of yesterday

My time's-a-coming
When those despised
Take shelter from the power
Of my Kiowa eyes

Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros

Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros

And there's a bullet with my name on it

Oi Oi Oi!
