You'll hear this now (repeated many times throughout the song)

Silently pacing, all fear erased here, it's time to face it, cold sweats profusely, crowd chanting loudly, one goal pursuing, one thought consuming.

Now you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid

No excuse will suffice, deadly, quick and precise, trained for this moment, no one else could can own it, keep all eyes on me, one goal pursuing, one thought consuming

Now you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage,
Put your heart on the line it determines your fate, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage

Inside this octagon, eight sided nightmare just begun
Warriors modern battleground, can't let him get me down
No nois just quiet now, one goal of pursuing, one thought consuming

Now you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage,
Put your heart on the line it determines your fate, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage

When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)

Now you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage,
Put your heart on the line it determines your fate, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage
Now you're stepping inside where you cant be afraid, it's a matter of right when you enter the cage,
Put your heart on the line it determines your fate, it's a matter of pride when you enter the cage

When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
When you enter the cage (Get tapped out)
