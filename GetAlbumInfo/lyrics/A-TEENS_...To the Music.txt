There ain't no time for excuses (no time)
We have been waiting to catch this moment
The sun is shining above us (shinin' above us)
So let the music control your feelings

Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone let's all get down
To the melody we found

And you'll be fallin' in love
To the music
So you cannot get enough
Of the music
And you'll be fallin' in love
To the music
So you cannot get enough
Of the music

Wherever music is playin' (tonight)
The summer fever will catch your body
The way we groove to the rythm (alright)
We're having fun and we just won't stop

Summertime brings joy to life

To the music
So you cannot get enough
Of the music
And you'll be fallin' in love
To the music
So you cannot get enough
Of the music
