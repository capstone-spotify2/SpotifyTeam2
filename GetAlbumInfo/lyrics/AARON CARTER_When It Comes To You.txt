Oh yeah (oh yeah)

Six thirty mama get you out of bed
e-mail what you gonna wear to you girlfriend
Skip you Breakfast, forget your backpack
When your half way, and you runback
Your daddy's angel with a halo
Everybody's looking at you more like a J. Lo
There is so much more to you

So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
What you wanna know now baby

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you

Now your middle name is August
But I remember you were born in November
You lived in Jersey but you from Ontario
Your twin sister likes to talk in stereo
We got so much in common
Like Jane &amp; Reeds with lots of Bottom
But there's more we could do

So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you wanna know now baby

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you

I want you to know
Baby I've been studying
Pulling all nighters
When I could've been partying
I can't fail
It's in the details
Understanding all that which is female
Some guys don't ever see what they're missing
Talking about themselves when they should be listening
I pay attention to things you say to me
When it comes to you
It's in my memory

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it when it when it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What you what your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it goes to you
