What made you come to prom 
You want me then you don't 
I cant figure it out 
Why can't I let go 

My mind is torn in two 
This love is difficult 
I wanna live 
But I keep running back to you 

Don't know if I should stay 
Walk away 
Or leave you babe 
You got me in a daze 
Why cant you fade 
To a crazy place 

I wanna run away, fly away, get away 
But Ii still feel you babe 
Want you babe 
Need you babe 

Everytime we split, tell myself that's it 
Giving up, I quit, 
And then I love you again 
I'm right, you're wrong 
And it's all your fault 
Here's your ring, I'm gone 
I think I love you again 

Tug of war, cant make my mind up 
Tug of war, I'm undecided 
Tug of war, my heart cant fight it 
I think I love you again 
Tug of war, I love you honey 
Tug of war, still undecided 
Tug of war, this isn't right 
Should I stay or should I go 

I hate your stupid voice 
You don't give me no choice 
You talking at me and over me 
All I hear is yours 
But when I'm feelin' down 
You always cheer me up 
I'm so confused 
Am I in or outta luck 

Don't know if I should stay 
Walk away 
Or leave you babe 
You got me in a daze 
Why cant you fade 
To a crazy place 

I wanna run away, fly away, get away 
But I still feel you babe 
Want you babe 
Need you babe 

Everytime we split, tell myself that's it 
Giving up, I quit, 
And then I love you again 
I'm right, you're wrong 
And it's all your fault 
Here's your ring, I'm gone 
I think I love you again 

Tug of war, cant make my mind up 
Tug of war, I'm undecided 
Tug of war, my heart cant fight it 
I think I love you again 
Tug of war, I love you honey 
Tug of war, still undecided 
Tug of war, this isn't right 
Should I stay or should I go 

Honey, come on, you keep pulling me close 
I give you what you want, what you want the most 
What ever the weather you thought we would be together 
Now my love for you was stupid like a month old rose 
Hey I'm out that door, do we ever really know really for sure 
If you decide to be too blind to see, you will never find another me 
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me 

Cant make up my mind now 
I think I love you again 

Everytime we split, tell myself that's it 
Giving up, I quit, 
And then I love you again 
I'm right, you're wrong 
And it's all your fault 
Here's your ring, I'm gone 
I think I love you again 

Tug of war, cant make my mind up 
Tug of war, I'm undecided 
Tug of war, my heart cant fight it 
I think I love you again 
Tug of war, I love you honey 
Tug of war, still undecided 
Tug of war, this isn't right 
Should I stay or should I go
