Oh the sweet addiction
Of forbidden fruit
Oh the strange affliction
That has taken root

Oh the hidden cancer
Cancer of the soul
Oh the necromancer
Inside us all

I have never seen this many
People gathered in one place together
Don't ask about it
You don't want to know

Caught up in the fury of euphoria
They say will last forever
Don't ask about it
It might just be so

Oh the burning candle
Oh the pretty flame
Come fly into the night with us
And feel the same

Oh the sweet surrender
Oh the solemn vow
Leave your old identity
And join us now

I believe that I have been
Through this before
And I can still remember
Maybe a past life
I just can't tell
The faces and the uniforms
Are changed yet
There's something so familiar
Am I still under
That same old spell

Oh the sweet addiction
Of forbidden fruit
Oh the strange affliction
That has taken root

Oh the love of darkness
Oh the vampire's kiss
Have mercy on a people
Who would dream like this
Who would dream like this
Like this
