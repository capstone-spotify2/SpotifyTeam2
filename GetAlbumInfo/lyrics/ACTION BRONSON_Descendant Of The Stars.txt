As a descendant of the stars it's only right that I become one
As a descendant of the stars it's only right that I become one

They tried to sign your boy to a deal like a Japanese pitcher
I heard Barkley bought a Mazda for a stripper
Yo what a shitty tipper, that's where we differ
I hand her the keys to the Beamer to uplift her
11 miles up the river there's a base camp
Play the Tec
Wait for the enemy they came and went
I'll admit I had to lay some hands
The doctor said I should be taking meds
Someone pass the weed to my mother tell her roll that shit
Can a motherfucker get a soul clap bitch?
I don't give a fuck I'm just a grown ass kid
Eyes wide shut I control that whip
I did an interview for GQ while takin' a shit
I'm into gettin' cake and wearin' snake skin when I spit
I'm in my hey-day, people only call me when it's payday
If I was drownin' would they save me? (hell no)

My jump shot got an ark like Noah
And 10 of every kind of animal can roll up
I park water like it's just another ordinary night
Every day it's clearer that there's more to life
You can catch me at the Grammy's rockin' white sweats
It's obvious that I like sex
Half RoboCop, half Mike Tyson tatted on my neck
This is Captain Bronson live from the flight deck
Land on remote islands you can't change my channel
Doin' donuts on the camel
Desert storm camo on
I'm on the same drugs that Hammer was on
Turn the camera on, I'm like a fuckin' monster out the Amazon

God damn, shit boy
Queens in the motherfuckin' buildin' you already know
It's me
