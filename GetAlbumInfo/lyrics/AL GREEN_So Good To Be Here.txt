Now, now that it's over, baby
I can come home to you
Just as I should do

And you're waiting there for me
Just as you should be
I'm hoping to see you soon

Now that you've got all the things
That you need, babe
You're still here waitin' for me

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
It's so good to be loved by you
In every way

All I can say or do
Is give my love to you
Just as I should do

I can't imagine me leaving you
Wasting my time
When I wanna be with you, babe

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you

Everyday it's hard to make you stay
But still in your heart
You're gonna run away from me, baby

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
