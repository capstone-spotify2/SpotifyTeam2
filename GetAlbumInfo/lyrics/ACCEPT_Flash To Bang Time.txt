Counting the seconds I could see myself
And it shook me right out of my mind
Staring right back at me, freezing the frame
I felt like a hostage in time

Caught somewhere between the spark and crash
Oooooww...... It happened in a flash

Streaks of light, rip the night
Exploding in my mind
The sound of spheres, splits my ears
Caught in the Flash to Bang Time

Way past the crosshairs of space and time
I can see a dimension away
A cosmic eruption of neon fog
In an instant it starts to decay

Just like a match turned to smoke and ash
Oooooww...... It happened in a ï¬ash

Streaks of light, rip the night
Exploding in my mind
The sound of spheres, splits my ears
Caught in the Flash to Bang Time

Floating on wreckage in black and white
Thru a negative reality
Trapped in a mirror where day is night
And I have to wake up from this dream

<i>[Solo]</i>

Streaks of light, rip the night
Exploding in my mind
The sound of spheres, split my ears
Caught in the Flash to Bang Time

It happened in a flash
In the Flash to Bang Time
