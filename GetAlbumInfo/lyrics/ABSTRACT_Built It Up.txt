Any day now I've been waiting
Been a long time coming baby
Come closer, take it easy
Ain't gotta rush, no
We're holding the pieces
Let's build it up

Been more than distant
I'm the one to blame
I'm a bigger picture person
But I tend to stay inside my frame
Tend to stay inside my room
Working some nights 10 to 2
Making moves to making tunes
But I know I shoulda made time for you
Remember late night talks
Without shit to do
We were small town kids
Without shit to lose
You were always there to pick me up
When my times were getting rough
Someone I could go to and trust
Hit the ground and you patched me up
Years later
And I still ain't met another girl like you
When we talked the other day
Got off the phone like nothing changed
Ain't it crazy years later
Still feels me the same
What we had is still ignited
We just need to fan the flame

Any day now I've been waiting
Been a long time coming baby
Come closer, take it easy
Ain't gotta rush, no
We're holding the pieces
Let's build it up

I'm not quite sure what will happen
Both our lives are on quite a rise while chasing after passion
Know I kept my heart distracted
Since you every love is passive
Sorry if I tried to mask it
I was distant, it was tragic
When you left you're all I thought about
When you came back I can't believe I kept you out
In my mind I was in my prime
I was so obsessed with tryna keep my grind
Wasn't focused on the things
That shoulda mattered at the time
I was selfish, so conceded
Apologize a hundred times
Know I could write a thousand lines
Write a song a thousand miles
Cause I could
But I know that wouldn't help
Like it would
Like showing you myself
Cause you know

Any day now I've been waiting
Been a long time coming baby
Come closer, take it easy
Ain't gotta rush, no
We're holding the pieces
Let's build it up
