We took the long ride home 
I guess just one last trip 
To set us back 
And tear us apart 
I can see those bloodstained sheets 
It plays in my dreams and in my head 
Again. 
So what went wrong? 
Where'd these demons come from tonight? 
Come from tonight? 
Cause I know that everything's alright 
This silent perfect deadly comes from tonight 
Cause I know that everything's alright 
And I know it always will be. 
He left a note that read I'm truly sorry Mom 
For what's been done 
There's no replacing time 
I can see your bloodstained soul 
It plays in my sights and my ears 
I can hear. 
So what went wrong? 
Where'd these hÃ¥los come from tonight? 
Come from tonight? 
Cause I know that everything's alright 
This silent perfect deadly comes from tonight 
Cause I know that everything's alright now 
And I know it always will be. 
Can you hear the ghost ring through me? 
Can you hear the ghost ring through my heart?
