You've got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive,
Eliminate the negative,
Latch on to the affirmative,
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between.

You've gotta spread joy up to the maximum,
Bring pain down to the minimum,
Have faith or pandemonium,
Li'ble to walk upon the scene.

You gotta think all,
All things are possible
End all thought of the improbable
Having all really ain't that remarkable
After all it's all what you believe

To illustrate my last remark,
Jonah in the whale,
Noah in the Ark,
What did they do,
Just when everything looked so down?

You've got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive,
Eliminate the negative,
Latch on to the affirmative,
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between,

You've got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive,
Eliminate the negative,
Latch on to the affirmative,
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between,

It's how you think
All how you think about it

To illustrate my last remark,
Jonah in the whale,
Noah in the Ark,
What did they do,
Just when everything looked so down?

Man, they said you gotta ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive,
Eliminate the negative,
And latch on to the affirmative,
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between,
No, don't mess with Mr. In-Between
No, don't mess with Mr. In-Between
