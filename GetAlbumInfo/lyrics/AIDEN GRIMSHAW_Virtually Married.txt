Coming down, 'cause we've been up so long
When you said "We are done"
I know your heart is on the run
We'd only just begun

Making all these promises
Thought that you would wear my rings
Be the one to share it with
<i>[x2]</i>
You are the one

How did you make me feel like I love you?
How did you?

But you shot me now

You are my everything, everything <i>[x3]</i>
You are my, you are my

Now that you are gone
Tell me how to make this wrong
You know it was right before

Making all these promises
Thought that you would wear my rings
Be the one to share it with

You are the one
Now you're done

How did you make me feel like I love you?
How did you?
I thought that I was bulletproof
But you shot me now

You are my everything, everything <i>[x3]</i>
You are my, you are my

Calling out your name, girl
Cause you're everything I want
And I hope you stay the same, girl
Cause I thought you were the one

How did you make me feel like I love you?
How did you?
I thought that I was bulletproof
But you shot me now

You are my everything, everything <i>[x3]</i>
You are my, you are my

Calling out your name, girl
Cause you're everything I want
And I hope you stay the same, girl
Cause I thought you were the one
