Rain wets your body - rain wets the streets
But people have seen you just went out
But nobody helps you

Sexual girl running down highway
Time is passing by, I say
But nobody, I say

Tired of me - she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me - there's nothing at all
Tired of me so - I can't call

Nothing exists - just you at your way
Girl, get your freedom - that's what I say
I don't believe what I say

Tired of me - she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me - there's nothing at all
Tired of me so - I can't call

Hey - hey - hey - hey

Tired of me - she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me - there's nothing at all
Tired of me so - I can't call
