I'm not too young 
And I'm not too old

Listen up, everybody
This ain't Aaron's party
Part 2 I'm older now
Come and show me body
Girl whatcha gonna do, come and talk
To me in the backseat
Baby backstreet 
(Yeah)
We could surf the board
Surf the net, yeah
Better yet
We could make a little bet
If we get together,
Yo it's gonna be the bomb
Hit me all, baby
Aaron Carter dot com
See when it comes to girls
I'm not too young
(Mommy)
Baby face back up on the scene
But when I get in trouble,
Hey I'm not too old
I pull my cap way down
And say I'm thirteen years old
That's how we roll

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young
And I'm not too old

Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control 
This is how we roll
I'm not too young and I'm not too old

It's the A to the A to the R O N
I'm all grown up now
Run and tell your friend
It's all sewn up now
Where do I begin?
Don't even play a hater
Tryin' to say I look ten
I'll tell you again
I all up in da video
Catch me in the studio
That's my life, bro
It's in my blood, hey!
It ain't my fault
You wanna step to me,
We can take it to the asphalt
Shoot some hoops
Can you slam dunk the funk
Battle on the rollerblades
You callin me a punk?
Bring on the skateboards
Or the BMX
Show me watcha got
Is that all? Please, next!
I'll wipe the floor with you
Where's your concentration?
Don't even talk about the Sony Playstation
I'll make it happen if its games that you want
Aaron Carter gotcha open
Dont front dont front lets roll

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll 
I'm not too young
And I'm not too old

Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young 
And I'm not too old

He's steppin' out with the older boys 
Cover up your ears
'Cause we're makin' mad noise
He's steppin' out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 
'Cause we rock the world!

See when it comes to takin all the girls for cruisin'
All I need is pillows, hello!
I'm not too young
(Doo doo doo doo)
My cellular rung
(Doo doo doo doo)
Switch it off, yo
Hit me on the pager
A real teenager
With a fake beard
Battin' in the majors
That's how we roll
And when it suits me 
I'm anywhere between 12 and 18 years old

Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young
And I'm not too old

Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young 
And I'm not too old
