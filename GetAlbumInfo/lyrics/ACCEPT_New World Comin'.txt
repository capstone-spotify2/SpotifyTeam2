Everybody's on probation... Close to the end of the line
Subject to cancellation... Livin' on borrowed time
One day you've got it all... Then you're flat on your back
So hurry up and get your ticket... Cos' the train's comin' down the track

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
You can't run from the reaper
You'll never hold back the tide
Can't stop a raging river
You know it's only a matter of time

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, there's a new world comin'
Yeah, it's a brand new world

Gravity is like a free ride... Rollin' down a one way street
Caught up in a giant landslide... Rockin' people off their feet
One day you got it all... Then you're deep in a hole
Got no time to pack your bags... The world ain't gonna wait for you

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
You can't run from the reaper
You'll never hold back the tide
Can't stop a raging river
You know its only a matter of time

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, there's a new world comin'
It's a brand new world
(Oh...) There's a new world comin'
(Oh...) Yeah, it's a brand new... world

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(Oh...) There's a new world comin'
(Oh...) Yeah, it's a brand new world
(Oh...) There's a new world comin'
(Oh...) Yeah, there's a new world... comin'
