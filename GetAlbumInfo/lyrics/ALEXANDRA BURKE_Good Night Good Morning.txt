This beat is crazy 
This club amazing 
This is where I'm gonna be 
I'm on the floor don't worry me 

And this guy is crazy 
His frame amazing 
I got my sin all over him 
As we dance erotically 

His body interlocks with mine 
Sends chills all up and down my spine 
And I pull him close and whisper in his ear 

Oh, I said 

What will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 

What will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning?

I feel so crazy 
She feels amazing 
Ooh the way she's touching me 
I can't imagine what it would be 

Her body interlocked with mine 
Sends chills all up and down her spine 
She pulls me closer and whispers in my ear 

Oh, she said 

When will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 

What will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning?

Everything in the room started spinning 
Got his voice in my head

How she work in the middle 
But there's something about her

She looks me in my eyes and lord she has to say
