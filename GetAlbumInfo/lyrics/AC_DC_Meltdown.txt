I look at my watch to find out the right time of the day
I look at her libido hey hey hey
Gotta get up and climb her to roll her on the hay
Makin' a sweat, temperature rise all through the day

Man it's getting hot hot hot
I said man it's getting hot hot hot
It's getting hotter and hotter
Man it's getting hot hot
Getting hot around here

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

I got a feelin' in my bones
I been rackin' my brains out all night long
Stokin' up the fire take it right up to the wire
Burnin' on and on' burnin' on

Man it's getting hot hot hot
I said man it's getting hot hot hot
It's getting hotter and hotter
Man it's getting hot hot
Getting hot around here

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
Meltdown

Man it's getting hot hot hot
I said man it's getting hot hot hot
It's getting hotter and hotter
And hotter and hotter

It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
I said down down
It's a meltdown, meltdown, meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
