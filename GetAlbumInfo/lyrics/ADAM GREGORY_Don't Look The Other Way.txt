I remember Dad and I 
Stopped the car one rainy night 
To help a stranger fix a flat 
And get on his way 
And I said Daddy do you know that man 
Was he one of your friends 
And he just smiled Said let me help you understand 
So don't look the other way 
When you can help someone in need
The good Lord gave you eyes 
Don't pretend that you can't see
That might be you someday 
So don't look the other way 
Thru the wind and pouring rain 
As we drove away 
My Dad he sat there soaking wet 
With a smile on his face 
And I knew 
Though I was just a kid I'd always remember what he did 
When raindrops fell His words would fill my mind again 
So don't look the other way 
When you can help someone in need 
The good Lord gave you eyes 
Don't pretend that you can't see 
That might be you someday 
So don't look the other way 
And now many years have come and gone Daddy's barely hanging on 
If I turn my back I won't have to see it end like that 
But I don't look the other way 
When I can help someone in need 
The good Lord gave me eyes for a reason 
Now I see 
That might be me someday I won't look 
The other way
