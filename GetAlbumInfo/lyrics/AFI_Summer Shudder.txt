Listen when I say,
When I say it's real.
Real life goes undefined,
Why must you be so missable?

Everything you take,
Makes me more unreal.
Real lines are undefined.
How can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain, I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
You turned away.

Listen I can't make.
Make a sound or feel.
Feel fine I kissed the lies,
Why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break.
Break the fourth wall's seal.
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide
When will we be invisible?

Under the summer rain, I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
We find a way.
Under the summer rain, I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
You turned away.

This is the fall,
This is the long way down.
And our lives look smaller now,
And our lives look so small.
Willingly crying.

This is the fall,
This is the long way down.
And our lives look smaller now,
And our lives look so small.

Under the summer rain, I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
We find a way.

Under the summer rain, I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
We find a way.

Under the summer rain (Burn!)
I burnt away.
Under the summer rain (Burn!)
You turned away...
