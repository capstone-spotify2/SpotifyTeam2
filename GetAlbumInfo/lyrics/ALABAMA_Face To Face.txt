Run your fingers through my hair and softly kiss my lips
Hold me close in your embrace and love me face to face.

Face to face, heart to heart, body to body
Tingling tangle feelings, lovers face to face.

I'll caress your body and hold you close to me
I'll slide my hands around your waist and love you face to face.

Face to face, heart to heart, body to body
Lips on lips, arm and arm, body to body
Tingling tangle feelings, lovers face to face.

Softly say you love me as you make love to me
No one else can take your place, we happen face to face...
