Well I guess it's just not my day
The wind blew my morning paper away
Then I cut my toe on a sliver of glass
From the stormdoor you broke when you left here so fast

If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you

Well I rented that movie you hate
But that old VCR just chewed up the tape
Then I went to the freezer thought I'd cook me a steak
All I found was that old piece of our wedding cake

If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you

But I never knew that I needed you so
But now that I've lost you, I can't let you go

If it ain't one thing oh it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
Oh if it ain't one thing
It's you
