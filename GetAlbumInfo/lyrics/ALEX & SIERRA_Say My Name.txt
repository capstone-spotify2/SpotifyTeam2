Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, 
ain't callin' me baby
better say my...

Any other day I would call you would say
Baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?

If you took it there, first of all let me say!
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me I'm the boy that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you sayin' that I'm assuming things
Something's goin' down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
Nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there tell me who

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, 
ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

What is up with this
Tell the truth, who you with
How would you like it if I came over with my clique
Don't try and change it now
See you've gotta bounce
When two seconds ago,
Said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question why do you feel you got to lie?
Getting caught up in your game
When you can not say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're saying everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, 
ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea...

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, 
ain't callin' me baby

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, 
ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
