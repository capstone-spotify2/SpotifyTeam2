My heart just sank the moment I saw you,
You're the image of a girl that I used to know.
Don't be alarmed, if it seems hard, for me to explain,
But every detail of your face makes me recall the name.
Hmmm treading water, I keep,
Treading water.

Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.
Maybe it's another chance,
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way.
Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.

Can you forgive the things I do, that I can't amend?
Not the way I yearn for her,
I hope you can't pretend.
Girl you're a fire and you'll find,
That I want to get burned.
No matter what you can teach me,
I'm sure I'll never learn.
Hmmm treading water, I keep,
Treading water.

Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.
Maybe it's another chance,
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way.
Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.

If my concentration,
Seems spread too thin.
And when you speak, my eyes glaze over.
I'm sorry girl, it's not you, it's her.

And you're another chance,
To mock myself again.
Maybe you're another chance,
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way.
Maybe it's another chance.

Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.
Baby your another chance,
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way.
Maybe it's another chance,
To mock myself again.
