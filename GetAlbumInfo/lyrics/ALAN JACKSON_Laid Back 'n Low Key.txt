Laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

Gentle roar of the wave on the shore
Makes its way through the crack neath the door
Wake up call from the ocean floor down in Avid Cove

Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

Tequila Sunrise with a coconut base, hammock swingin in the palm tree shade
Standard Island beach Resort cliche, hey, but thats okay

Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

Wind blowin on the back of my neck, sun reflectin off that tan on your breast
Found that feelin that we lost long ago down in Avid Cove

Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
