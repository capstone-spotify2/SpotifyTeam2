Roll, Roll, wooo

Hey, ho (hey, ho)
I'm always out of control
Steady moving this is how we roll
Only streets know where we go
Cause I ain't got to stay in one place

<i>[ABK]</i>
The wheels on a bus go round and round
Smokin' different weed from town to town
I guess I'll see you when I get there
Have it rolled up cause you know how I love them blunts

<i>[Esham]</i>
Man, I got 10's and 20's whatever you need
But since you're my homie dog, you smokin' for free

<i>[ABK]</i>
I got mad love from my people for my people
Actin' the same cause we all see equal
No different, we bleed the same
So when you see, quit bein' all strange

<i>[Esham]</i>
Hey, hey, what's up man?
<i>[ABK]</i>
What's up dog?
<i>[Esham]</i>
I didn't want to bother you or nothing
But I wanted to say, what's up you know?
<i>[ABK]</i>
What's up, yeah
<i>[Esham]</i>
Just wanted to tell to keep doing what you're doing
Which is real

Whooo!! <i>[x3]</i>

Hey, ho (hey, ho)
I'm always out of control
Steady foolin' this the way we roll
Only streets know where we go
Cause I ain't got time to stay in one place

Back on the streets with a new release
Road Fools all day man fuck the police (fuck 'em)
Let's go, let's go is what we be thinkin' (let's go)
Back to the hotel so we can start drinkin'
You know this night has just begin
Road Folls in this bitch call a friend (holla back)
Don't be nervous just relax
You got some things to go along with this sack (it's all rolled)

Hey, ho (hey, ho)
