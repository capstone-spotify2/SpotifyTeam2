<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Hello, good morning
This is mourning, just a feeling I reckon
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans and friends playing my records
I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it
Don't forget that dash in my name when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it
I'm a God MC not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
Let a reverend run in my adidas
You'll see that despite all these dislikes I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments
But I don't seem to break to many of them either
Try to understand me
Obama said "yes we can"
But that can't be
Cause we was raising money for his campaign
T-shirt, plates, and mugs
But won't do the same in our own community?
What the fuck...
I said what the fuck?

<i>[Hook: Ab-Soul]</i>
And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
How's it going, good afternoon
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
It's funny though, I could have just told a lie
And made it true to take the mood
You think I am what I ain't
Like a saint or fake
We could go toe to toe, you're choice it's no debate
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams is coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
In sheer disbelief
Tell me how I can get high as the sky and keep my ear to the streets
At the same time, no diamonds in my watch
Can I still shine, will anybody watch
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean to disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect not to reject
Don't press eject...
I said don't press eject...
Soul!

And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return

<i>[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]</i>
It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
Free in body, mind, and soul

<i>[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]</i>
No idea's original
It's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do
But how it's done
If you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means your inferior not major...
