Look babe I was smitten by you, I ain't wanna fall
Don't know what to do baby, don't know what to do baby
I ain't never wanna stay true, telling you is hard
Don't say you never knew baby, say you never knew baby

You can't love me, no, can't love me
You can't love me, no, no-no-no
You can't, you can't, no, you can't, you can't love
You can't love me, no

I ain't sure what I should say
We've been texting back and forth all day
Feeling like we're something more, not what I was hoping for
Guess you can't control feelings, they just happen anyway
Can't lie, lying with you is the greatest
Your mind and those eyes quickly turned into my favorite
Gotta hell of a heart, I'm really trying not to break it
We all got our tragic stories, trying not to be your latest
Dammit... and you gotta love the hip hop
Really trying not to catch feelings girl, please stop
And you went to parks and wrecked, damn I bet, game is set
As if I wasn't falling for you from the get go
That's what I should probably do
But natural attraction got me staying here witchu
What to do, honestly I haven't got a clue
And I think you'd feel the same, tell me what's the next move

You can't love me, no, can't love me
You can't love me, no, no-no-no
You can't, you can't, no, you can't, you can't love
You can't love me, no

I would never cheat, that ain't the reason I retreat
But the reason that I'm breathing and I'm eating's from the beat
Owe my life to music, through mics I been dreaming lucid
Truth is, really hate do this, but I'm screaming, "Fuck you Cupid."
Hell you doing? Tryna start a movement, why you stalling me?
Shot the wrong arrow, keep my heart under lock and key
All I do is flow, why you tryna clog my arteries?
Love who I am, but damn who I am is hard to be
An introverted, clever worded, never certain mystery
A wise old man, despite the age that my body seems
In between dreams, I guess the other side is always green
Get there and see I'm never happy where my body be
Either its the traveler or little bit of lost in me
Searching for a place where I can finally breathe without a beat
Gotta get there, wish that you could come along with me
Hope that you don't hate me cause of this, love and peace
