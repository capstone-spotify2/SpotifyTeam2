I've been goin' around in a whirlwind
Not knowing which way to go
I've been lost in a jungle of heartaches
Looking for what I don't know
I've spread my wings and I've done some things
That I never meant to do
It's took me some time but I've made up my mind
I'm hanging up my travelin shoes.

Hangin' up my travelin' shoes
My runnin' around is all through
I'm foldin' my wings up for you
I'm hangin' up my travelin' shoes.

I've been riding a sea of uncertainty
Running away fom is all
I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me
Watched all my dreams rise and fall
I've made my mistakes but it's not too late
To pull myself out of the blues
It's took me some time but I've made up my mind
I'm hanging up my travelin shoes.

Hangin' up my travelin' shoes
My runnin' around is all through
I'm foldin' my wings up for you
I'm hangin' up my travelin' shoes
Hangin' up travelin' shoes...
