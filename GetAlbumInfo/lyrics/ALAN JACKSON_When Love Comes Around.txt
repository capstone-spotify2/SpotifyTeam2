Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
through the years and the tears 
I've learnt what loves about
this time i'll be ready 
when love comes around

When love comes around i'll be ready
love will find me a brand new man
i'll be standing there with my heart in my hand 
this time i'll be ready 
when love comes around

too many times i've lost a good love
and i can't see now how it went
but when love comes back to me 
it won't see the same old me 
this time i'll be ready when love comes around
