Hey J turn me up 
AM
You know I'm just bein' honest

I've been thinkin' about
Where we headed tryna' figure it out 
Hopin' that you'll still be around
Oh I do, oh I do
You should know it by now
It's more than just me hangin' around
I wanna be the reason you smile
It's true, oh it's true

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
There's no me without you
It's like the sky, with no blue
See ain't no me, without you
Girl you show me something that I never knew

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause I never thought I'd find it
Love so timeless, yeah 
I've never found nothing like this
Love so timeless, yeah 

Girl you open my eyes
It's crazy how you came in my life
You took a nigga heart by surprise
You know, yeah you know
The other girls wanna ride
But you the one to walk by my side
You the truth I can't even lie
You know, yeah you know

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I know what they say
Love don't exist
This day and age
But girl you the shit 
Can't believe I found you
I thought you'd feel the same
Matter of fact fuck rap
You make me wanna sing like
Ooooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh Ooooh Ooooh Oooh Oooh
Ohhh yeah
Ooooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh Ooooh Ooooh Oooh Oooh

<i>[Chorus]</i>
