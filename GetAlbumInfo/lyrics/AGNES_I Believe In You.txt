Sometimes everything around me gets me all confused 
sometimes it's hard to see and understand the truth 
Where do you go when all the signs don't make a bit of sense 
when all the roads end up some place you've already been 

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
I guess it's easy to lose faith 
but I've been blessed I've found my way 
'cause all I need to know is... 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I believe in my love for you 
It lights me up inside 
I believe in the things I feel 
Just looking in your eyes 
And every kiss that we share reminds 
me of what's good and true 
I believe in my love for you baby 
the joy that you bring me 
I believe in you 

Sometimes the world can seem so big and make you feel so small 
Sometimes it feels like all you do is trip and fall 
What gives us strength to keep it going when we hit the wall 
to get up every morning ready to give it all 

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
I guess it's easy to lose faith 
but I've been blessed I've found my way 
'cause all I need to know is... 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I believe in my love for you 
It lights me up inside 
I believe in the things I feel 
Just looking in your eyes 
And every kiss that we share reminds 
me of what's good and true 
I believe in my love for you baby 
the joy that you bring me 
I believe in you 

All that I need, all that I want 
is right here inside, inside of my heart 
Keeping me strong, keeps me holdin' on 
All that I need, all that I want 
is right here inside, inside of my heart 
Keeping me strong, keeps me holdin' on 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I believe in my love for you 
It lights me up inside 
I believe in the things I feel 
Just looking in your eyes 
And every kiss that we share reminds 
me of what's good and true 
I believe in my love for you baby 
the joy that you bring me 
I believe in you
