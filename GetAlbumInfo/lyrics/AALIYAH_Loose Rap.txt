I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All That Loose Rap

How Many Times I Tell You "Don't Come To Me."?
You Bring Me All Of That Jealousy 
Cause You Got Envy (Don't Hate Me Baby)
Talk Smack Behind My Back
And Then When You See Me
To Try To Come Up And Talk To Me (Don't Talk To Me)
I'm Not Saying Nothing, Nothing

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That

So Many Times You Guys Would Come Step To Me
I Guess You Call Yourself Booking Me
But Do I Look Easy? (It Ain't Easy)
Well, It Never Hurts To Try
I Just Might Let You Call Me
I Hope You Don't Plan On Buggin' Me
That Would Be Ugly

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All The Loose Rap
You Can Quit That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Stop All Your Loose Rap, Your Loose Rap

So Many Times I Hear Trying To Knock My Crew
Well, We've Got Something For All The Fools
It Ain't Just Rhythm And Blues
If You Just Quit Trying To Compete (Yeah)
No Telling What You Could Be
Might Even Be Doper Than Me, I Doubt It

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That

I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That
