It's so hard to feel right, baby 
When I'm travelin' around and you're far behind 
God, I wish I could see my lady
Girl, I hope you don't mind, 'cause

I'm snowblind, I can't see a thing
I'm snowblind, I don't wanna sing
I'm snowblind, need a familiar face
I'm snowblind, think I'm lost in space

Lookin' out my window, sometimes I wonder
Am I ever gonna get to where I'm gonna go home
Maybe tomorrow, maybe next summer
Girl, I just don't know, 'cause

I'm snowblind, I can't see a thing
I'm snowblind, I don't wanna sing
I'm snowblind, need a familiar face
I'm snowblind, think I'm lost in space

Movin' around, I get in trouble
When I'm feelin' so low and out of my mind
Babe, I don't wanna burst your bubble
Girl, you know the reason why, 'cause

I'm snowblind, I can't see a thing
I'm snowblind, I don't wanna sing
I'm snowblind, need a familiar face
I'm snowblind, think I'm lost in space
