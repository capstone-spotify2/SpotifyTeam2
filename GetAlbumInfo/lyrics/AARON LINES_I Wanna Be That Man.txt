Baby, when you smile at me
I know that you're all I'll ever need
You're my favorite song to sing
You're my raincoat when it rains
With all my heart and soul
I want you to know

I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man

When I look into your eyes
I know that's where I wanna spend my life, the rest of my life
You're my lazy Sunday afternoon
My crazy New Year's Eve, my parachute

And I love your innocence
I wouldn't change anything about you

I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man

I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man
