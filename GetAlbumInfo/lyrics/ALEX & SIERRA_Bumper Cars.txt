Can't help wondering what you're thinking
Wherever you are
Late night movies, careless drinking
To cover these scars 

And as much as I wanna be with you, I know...

You and me, we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart, no
Round and round we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to....
Is a pile of broken parts

We're bumper cars
Bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart

Good intentions, all these questions
I'm sitting alone
All roads since you are wrong directions
I'll never get home 

And it's making me wanna be with you, I know...

You and me, we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart, no
Round and round we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to
Is a pile of broken parts

We're bumper cars
Bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart, oh

This was supposed to be fun
This was supposed to be the one
Maybe we stayed too long
Maybe we played all wrong
This was supposed to be good
But I know, I know

You and me we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart, no
Round and round we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to...
Is a pile of broken parts

We're bumper cars
Bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart

We're bumper cars
Bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart
