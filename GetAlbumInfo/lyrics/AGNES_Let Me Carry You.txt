Hush said the angel 
Don't be lonely anymore 
I'm here right beside you 
Like so many times before 
Time and again 
I'm here to fill your heart 
Tonighy I'm gonna show you 
We're never far apart 

Just like before 
When you don't wanna walk anymore 

Let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Oh, let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Let me care for you 
I can heal the pain until it's gone 
Let me carry you, so you can carry on 

Hush said the angel 
You can tell em like it is 
'Cause I'm not here to judge you 
All I offer you is this 
Time and again 
I've been here to fill your dreams 
Tonight I'm gonna show you 
Love is closer than it seems 

Let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Oh, let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Let me care for you 
I can heal the pain until it's gone 
Let me carry you, so you can carry on  

When you feel like holding me 
I'll be there for sure, for sure 

Let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Oh, let me carry you 
Let me be the one 
Let me care for you 
I can heal the pain until it's gone 
Let me carry you, so you can carry on
