You've been there from day one
You've been there since my life's just begun
I don't know just how to explain
How I feel about you, I feel about you

Girl, don't get on that train
And don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

'Cause I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

And I'd never go and leave you
That's one thing about me
I'll never go and deceive you
No, no, no

I'd never go and bring you
And then turn and go away from you
Away from you

Don't get on the train
Don't get on the train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

Listen, I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Take my advice
Don't you never, never
Never, never, never
Think about it twice
All my life, all my life
One more time

Take my advice
Don't think about it twice tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't you dare get on that train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
And I swear this love is true
Baby, not tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight
