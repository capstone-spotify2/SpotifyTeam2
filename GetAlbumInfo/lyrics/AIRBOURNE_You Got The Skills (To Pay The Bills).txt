You're my Juliet eclipsing me
With your red light you're calling me
I been missing you all over me
I know you want it too baby here's your fee

Gonna be a big night
Loving up the night life
Shake it to the left and right
Baby you're one of a kind

You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
And give me a thrill tonight alright

You're professional and dangerous
With your lovin' so contagious
Take my card and my wages
This ain't personal this is business
Gonna be a big night
Loving up the night life
Shake it to the left and right
Baby you're one of a kind

You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
You got the skills to pay the bills
And give me a thrill alright
