Full moon in the sky
Is like an enemy

I feel like everybody
Is going to walk all over me

A never-ending fall
I can't believe it's real

Rolling down a hill
Tumbling like a broken wheel

I'm caught in a dream
Don't know where I've been
Way too extrame
It's making me scream

Climbin' up a mountain
Never getting to the top
Walking on the edge
I fight to wake up

I'm caught in a draam
Don't know where I've been
Way too extreme
It's making me scream
