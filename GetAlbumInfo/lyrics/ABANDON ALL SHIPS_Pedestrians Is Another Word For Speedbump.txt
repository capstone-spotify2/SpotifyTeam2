Take one last breath
You're about to jump to your death <i>[x2]</i>

Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door. <i>[x2]</i>

Captain Captain
Before the sail rips <i>[x3]</i>
Gasp for air
ABANDON ALL SHIPS!!!

The current's strong,
the waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding me down.
I'm on a cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin I've paid my price.
God is our captain,
change your direction

Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt. <i>[x2]</i>
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded.

Look what we've built, walking on the plank of guilt. <i>[x3]</i>

Who parts the sea?
Choose your side.
So come with me.
You decide. <i>[x2]</i>
