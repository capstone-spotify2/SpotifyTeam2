Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, love said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
