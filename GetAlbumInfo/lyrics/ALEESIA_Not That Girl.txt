You told me you're so in love
That I'm a perfect angel
That's send from up above

You said that you'll buy me everything
Take me around the world
Give me diamonds and pearls

Your word's another lies
I see it in your eyes
Can't say I'm surprised
I'm not that girl

(Hey!) Just get away
(Hey!) Shut up don't talk
(Hey!) I'm sick of talking
(Hey!) So sick of you
(Hey!) You thought you had me
(Hey!) Look who shot you

I shot you down
Got you in your heart
When you thought I get in the way

I'm not that girl
Falling for your lies
Don't believe a word that you say

I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you bang, bang, bang

You tell me
You want me want me more

This is a useless conversation
I'm just a fascination

You said that you're never giving up
To jump up in your ride
We'll be Bonnie and Clyde

You want to know the lies
I see it your eyes
Can't say that I'm surprised
I'm not that girl, girl, girl

(Hey!) Just get away
(Hey!) Shut up don't talk
(Hey!) I'm sick of talking
(Hey!) So sick of you
(Hey!) You thought you had me
(Hey!) Look who shot you

I shot you
I shot you down
Got you in your heart
When you thought I get in the way

I'm not that girl
Falling for your lies
Don't believe a word that you say

I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you, bang

I shot you down
Get you in your heart
When you thought I get in the way

I'm not that girl
Falling for your lies
Don't believe a word that you say

I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
I shot you down
