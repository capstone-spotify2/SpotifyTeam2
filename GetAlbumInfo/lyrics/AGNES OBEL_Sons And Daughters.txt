We are the ones 
Of the free
The sons and daughters
Come with us 
You will see
Our future

We borrow, we play
For we, know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway

Moving fast
When the weight
Upon our shoulders
Nothing in 
Our world
Will ever hold us

We borrow, we play
For we, know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway

<i>[Instrumental Break]</i>

Can you hear, what we say?
Will you fear us?
Can we call, you again?
Will you need us?

We borrow, we play
For we, know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway

Unchanged anyway
