Over the hill
I will be waiting on for you
I won't pretend
That you don't mean nothing to me
Come now, come now,
Come back now, come back now

The doubt will creep
And crawl in on you
The dark can leap
And fall upon you
Come back now, come back now

Let it be, let it go,
Let it fall, let it blow
Let it come, let it go,
Let it fall, we will know.
