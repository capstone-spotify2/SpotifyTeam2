Burning lights
Hang over head
Body high
Swimming in my bed
We ignite
We're slipping like sand

Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now (want it now)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Higher heights
To shallow breaths
Holding tight
Never, never end
Pull me down
To ecstasy

Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
Want it, want it, want it, want it, and I want it now (want it now)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
