There's no escape from this awful place!

Hey, stranger what's your name?
Have we met before?

Take a look around, the scenes are all the same.
I can see the veil right behind me.
I'll close my eyes and this will go away.
Have I ever said this before!?
If I just keep moving will I be okay or panic in the mayhem!?
I can't take it, I'm battered and broken, abandoned forever!

It's round and round and round we go.
Somebody please let me know just what it takes to begin to start all over again.

The truth has finally shown it's face.
How long have I been in this place?
I never had a choice, you blinded me and stole my voice!
I will see you soon.

Hey, stranger what's your name?
Have we met before?

Do I ever dare to question fate's design or submit to such a bleak destiny?
There has to be another way than this, It's a hopeless fight anyway!
I will not give up and wash away the sin, I'm thirsting for the carnage!
I can't take it, I'm battered and broken, abandoned forever!

It's round and round and round we go.
Somebody please let me know just what it takes to begin to start all over again.

The truth has finally shown it's face.
How long have I been in this place?
I never had a choice, you blinded me and stole my voice!

I will no longer take flight from you...
Now that you've got me, what's next?!
Let me help.
Now I destroy you, demon!
Sinew is ripped to shreds!
Stripped form your body, crimson!
Fury of righteousness will now consume you in death!

It's the sweet, sweet song of your heartbeat.
All I feel is a memory.
Of the night I laid in bed with you.
It's the easy sound of your breathing.
Telling me what I should've seen.
Where was I when you fell fast asleep?

I can't live without you by my side.

It's round and round and round we go.
Somebody please let me know just what it takes to begin, to start all over again!
