One of these mornings
I'm going away
Any day now
I'm going to Heaven to stay

I don't know how soon
Maybe morning, night or noon
But I'm going to see the Father
And by His side to stand

There'll be no sorrow, no sadness
Just only complete gladness
But any day now, I know that I
Know that I am going home

Then I'll shout Hallelujah
And give praises to His name
Pray any day now, I know that I
Know that I am going home
