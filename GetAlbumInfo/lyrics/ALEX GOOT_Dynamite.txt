Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands

'Cause it goes on and on and on...
Yeah, it goes on and on and on...

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes,
Saying AYO! Gotta let go!
I wanna celebrate and live my life,
Saying AYO! Baby, letâs go!

'Cause we gonâ rock this club,
We gonâ go all night,

Now I told you twice,
We gonâ light it up,
Like itâs dynamite!

Get out the way of me and my crew, crew, crew, crew

Just what I came here to do, do, do, do
