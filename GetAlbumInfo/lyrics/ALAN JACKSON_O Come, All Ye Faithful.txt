O come, all ye faithful, 
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, 
Born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

Sing, choirs of angels, 
Sing with exultation;
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God, glory in the highest

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, 
Born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
Word of the Father, 
Now in flesh appearing.

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord...
