Hold me close
Baby hold me tight
Cause I've got something to say tonight
Hear me oh
Baby hear me through
It's only words but the words are true
You are my sun up in the sky
A shoulder when I cry
My candle in the night
You are my laughter in the rain
A shelter from the pain
My angel in disguise

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Cross my heart
There's nothing that can make us part
I'm by your side
Give my word
That no one in this whole wide world
can change what I'm feelin'
I'm high on believin'
In love, in love, in love, in love

I make a promise I make a vow
I swear my love to you hear and now
Heart to heart
Baby eye to eye
You and me till the day we die
Promise you that I
Will catch you when you fall
Hear you when you call
I'll always be around

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Come whatever, and come what may
Everything's gonna be okay
All the way
Baby all the time
All we need is
Your lips and mine
You are my sun up in the sky
A shoulder when I cry
My candle in the night
You are my laughter in the rain
A shelter from the pain
My angel in disguise

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
