That summer was just crazy hot
We walked the fairground parking lot
And with our secret handshakes
Sealed the deal completely
But I'm too close to know just what
Will keep Pandora's boxes shut
And so I'll fail you badly
When you really need me

'Cause I don't know
What I should know 
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore

I'll get a pen and make a list
And give you my analysis
But I can't write this story
With a happy ending
Was I the bullet or the gun
Or just a target drawn upon
A wall that you decided
Wasn't worth defending?

And I should know
But I don't know
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
Anymore
No, I can't help you

'Cause baby, look what I have done
The ruins just go on and on
I've got to let it go now, or it will drag me under

So I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
Anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
