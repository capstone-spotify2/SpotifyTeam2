And in the end I will show you that this life is only madness
Can we filter out the toxicity and find worth in the static?

We build and build
We forget the model
We design the madness and we paint it gold
Swarming and spiraling burning at both ends
A blur on the horizon
We fail to keep site over and over again
Open your palms up resist the current

I am not your fathers son
Lost in the static
I am not your fathers son
Lost in the static
And you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
<i>[2x]</i>

With pressure, we creak and we bend
Crimson feet trample our joints
We splinter and break
We suffer again
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking to suffer the same
I'll stand right beside you
We slog side by side

Become a path others use to take
Lost in the static
Just to suffer the same
Blegh

Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
Hold me up and join me on the horizon
Kill whats left of the inner glow
Giving up the ghost
Growing cold

We never begin (We never begin)
Our own feet trample our joints
We burn both ends
A blur on the horizon
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking to suffer the same
I'll stand right beside you
We slog side by side

(Lost in the static, lost in the static)
We build and build we forget the model
We design madness and paint it gold

I am not your fathers son
Lost in the static
I am not your fathers son
Lost in the static
And you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
