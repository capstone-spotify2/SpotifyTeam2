Yeah
So give me that reason
I told you I loved you already, bitch, what the fuck?
Yeah

Shawl neck on the drunk lawyer
Coke shits in the toilet
Turkey sandwich in aluminium foil
The game been fixed
I donât play that shit
I aim that shit
If she looking at another mother fucker than you leave that bitch
I donât play that shit
Hear me
Left hand is steering
In a Amadu Diablo
Shit I got the urge to get a earring
Image in the rearview mirror like Timothy Leary
Donât even come near me
I keep it thug with a gun near me
Your boy been eating on the run clearly
Clear the run-way
720âs on a one way
So much drugs, what would a nun say?
And its Sunday
Shit, I donât really give a fuck
All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I did, fuck
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit, now thatâs no way to rep the East Coast
Every day Iâm walking with my head up
Donât let up âcause itâs a set-up
Like Albanian marriage go from Haiti to Paris
The bath was 90 degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease (shit,)
Bitch please Iâm the beeâs knees
Shooting Deca-Durabolin three CCâs
Peep the landscape
You can catch me in the trees like the shit for the pancakes
