Sheâs humming a tune
To keep herself from thinking
About all that sheâs facing
But her mind is racing
Over and over again

And I donât suppose she knows
Everything thatâs bound to happen
How and where the story goes
And I donât why I care
Sheâs up tight, not right
How could it matter to me

Sheâs humming a tune
To keep herself from straying
When everythingâs swaying
And decisions are weighing
Ever so hard on her mind

And I donât suppose she knows
Everything thatâs bound to happen
How and where the story goes
And I donât know if it just
Iâm bummed out, no doubt
What does it matter to me

Sheâs up tight, not right
How could it matter to me

And I donât suppose she knows

Sheâs up tight, not right
How could it matter to me
