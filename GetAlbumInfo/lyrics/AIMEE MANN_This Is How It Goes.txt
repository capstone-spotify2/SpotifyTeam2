This is how it goes
You'll get angry at yourself
And think you can think of something else
And I'll hear the clanging of the bells
'Cause I can't stop you baby...

'Cause I don't have the bribery in place
No bright shiny surface to my face
So I won't go near the market place
With what I'm selling lately
'Cause this is how it goes

'Cause it's all about drugs
It's all about shame
And whatever they want
Don't tell 'em your name

This is how it goes:
One more failure to connect
With so many how could I object?
And you, what on earth did you expect?
Well, I can't tell you, baby
When this is how it goes

'Cause it's all about drugs
It's all about shame
And whatever they want
Don't tell 'em your name

So I'll try to hold on
While you try to let go
You won't tell me it's gone
But, baby, I'll know
Baby, I'll know
Baby, I'll know
