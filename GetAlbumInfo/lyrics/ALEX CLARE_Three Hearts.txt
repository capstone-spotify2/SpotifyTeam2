Was grey autumn day, I was under paid
making minimum wage
Now I got some money, honey
You're a lucky charm that came my way
Gonna work, gonna save,
Gonna sell it all up for you and me
Need to build a home
Gotta make a house, for just we three
One heart, soon became two
Now there's three hearts beating
Under my roof
One heart, soon became two
Now there's three hearts beating
Under my roof
when i saw your face, with such grace
Hope my kids will look the same
I never had no one
Now I got you and another on the way!
Guess a traveling heart, chasing cars
Girl we've come so far
Soon I'll have a home,
With a fridge and a porch and a great big old backyard
One heart, soon became two
Now there's three hearts beating
Under my roof
One heart, soon became two
Now there's three hearts beating
Under my roof
Under my roof
Under my roof
