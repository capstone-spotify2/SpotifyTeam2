Here we go....

You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave

It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave

Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits

Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave

Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
For dancin' naked on New Year's Eve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave

I'll buy a one-way ticket to destination - you pick it
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave

Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits

Anytime you're nice, I can't help but think twice
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Aw yeah....
