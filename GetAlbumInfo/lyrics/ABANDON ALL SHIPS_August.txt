You paid attention
Was it time well spent?
Lies in the past, got dragged by the current.
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august

It's mist fills my lungs,
Save me while I'm still young

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean

I tried to drown the pain away
But my pain learned how to swim
I think about it everyday
I'm what she wants but she needs him
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august

It's mist fills my lungs
Save me while I'm still young

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean

Save me while I'm still young <i>[x2]</i>

I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
Hoping they get back to you

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean <i>[x2]</i>

Save me while I'm still young
