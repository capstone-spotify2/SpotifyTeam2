Faced with everyone's worst fear. Our trivial lives that don't marrer so why are we here? Oh what a dream, little bit of freedom little bit of fantasy. I once knew what it was, that drove me to strive for a new tomorrow. The anger that drove me when I was younger. Now I can see the hate that misguided me. Sometimes all I want to do is sleep. The world would never miss me. 

A sunny day then a starry night work a day job from eight to noon. Try to overcome the things up against me. She's all that keeps me going, she's all that keeps the fight in me. I try and hold onto my roots, she crowds my memory. She holds onto me, when I all I wanna do is sleep.
