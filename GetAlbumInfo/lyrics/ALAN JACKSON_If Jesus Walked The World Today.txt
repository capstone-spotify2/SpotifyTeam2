If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
Hed lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

If He was here today I bet Hed drive a Chevrolet
Workin at the plant drawin workers pay
Hed preach in some little country church outside of the city
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
Hed lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

His long hair and sandled feet would be in style
Surround himself with the good old boys to tell His tale
Hed have a mighty cross tatoo on his hands by the nail holes that killed Him
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
Hed lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

Some folks would say it wasnt really Him
You know theyd probably send Him off to some kind of looney bin

They wouldnt hang Him on the cross but theyd find some way to condem Him
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly

If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
Hed lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin
If Jesus walked the world today, Hed probably be a Hillbilly
Hed be a Hillbilly, yeah, Hed be a Hillbilly
Id bet Jesus be a Hillbilly, Lord, you know Hed be a Hillbilly
