What ya gonna do when the angel's come 
Ya move on; can't move them 
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911 
It's moving; so soothing 

Your passions deplete, it's just looking to feed 
Your own fantasy 
The blind side of you is a bad dream come true 
That you can't see 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
From an Angel's Eye 
Kiss Your Life Goodbye 
From An Angel's Eye 
Ain't no place to hide 

Tell me what you see through an Angel's Eye 
The halo; on fire 
You never really know till it's do or die 
Your devil's desire 

Your running in place like a rat in a race 
Going no where 
The evil you speaks from the tongue of the freaks 
So don't go there 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
<i>[GUITAR SOLO]</i>

What ya gonna do when the angel's come 
What ya gonna do when you come undone 
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911 
Ya so bad; can't hold them 

From an Angel's Eye 
Kiss your life goodbye 
From an angel angel angel's eye 
Ain't no place to hide 

Fallen Angel 
Fallen Angel 
Fallen Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel.
