Endless crowds of stars rip the clouds apart
And the moonlight strikes your hazel eyes
And the waves just seem to appreciate 
The way you curve to time and space

And gravity lets go of me
To get closer to your rays that sing
And the world erupts from the inner crust
It's not enough to feel your touch

To feel your touch

You're my inspiration in my dreams
And they can't take you away from me
And even if I go to sleep, you're right there waiting
Waiting for me
To sing my favorite melody
The stars will flicker in that key
I know you're watching, watching me
You've waited all this time
Just to shine

As the smoke clears and the dust collects
And atoms form, we coalesce
To form a smile, a slow bow
To take me away
Away somehow

Away somehow

You're my inspiration in my dreams
And they can't take you away from me
And even if I go to sleep, you're right there waiting
Waiting for me
To sing my favorite melody
The stars will flicker in that key
I know you're watching, watching me
You've waited all this time
Just to shine

You've waited all this time 
Just to shine
