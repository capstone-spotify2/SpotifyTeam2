<i>[Aesop Rock:]</i>
Deliver us from evil
Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone
Grim tone, bring him home
Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously
To those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety
Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap
Curse the digs
Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss
I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig
Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will
Make your bio sound less cool
If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse,
You might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before
Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars
Patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing
Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief
And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth
Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit
The googly off the daily paper
Clip red or blue (Blue!)
Either way the shredder chew
Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power <i>[x3]</i>
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing <i>[Echoes]</i>
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

I put a beetle on his back and take notes
Play a dealt hand. Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt
Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior
Help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck
He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye;
Filter sheepish winter through it's sister on the outside
Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you
Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets
Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him
Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment
Walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em
It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches
'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics
Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs
Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed
No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish:
Curfew the city that must not
Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt
He will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupant

Rotten egg, not to be pegged as fashionably tardy
The difference is the latter got the freebies from the barkeep
Wait, Aes-fucking-Rock is in the building
The room looked up, looked down, kept sniffing
Slit the neck and slip the chip in, sipping anti-governmental zombie grog
But zombied up gladly on your Swiss Army watch
As if twitching upon your authored condition's
Really that different from administered conditioning glitches
Kissing a firewater pitcher with the fatal Drano-chase game
It's hiding in the Nang labeled with the day-glow face paint
Some buckle when the T-Rex treks shakes the puddles
My huggable jungle
My son of a dove cry, humble, even doves die
I took the black outta something to judge the lung by
I took the mag out like the crack out of a bum's pipe
I hook the tag up like a flag over the plum sky
Mud pie cruiser with an oink for the innocent
I blame it on the ambiguous quote unquote system
If a quota needs some filling you're a whore
Sincerely yours, engine number nine conductor
All aboard!
