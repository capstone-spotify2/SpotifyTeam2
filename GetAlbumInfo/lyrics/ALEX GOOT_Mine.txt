Uh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallinâ
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say "Can you believe it?
As weâre lying on the couch?"
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
I made a rebel of a careless manâs careful daughter.
You are the best thing thatâs ever been mine.

Flash forward and weâre taking on the world together,
And thereâs a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Iâm guarded,
You say weâll never make my parentsâ mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
And we got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
I made a rebel of a careless manâs careful daughter
You are the best thing thatâs ever been mine.

Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
âCause thatâs all Iâve ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "Iâll never leave you alone."

I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, itâs like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless manâs careful daughter.
She is the best thing thatâs ever been mine.

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

I made a rebel of a careless manâs careful daughter
You are the best thing thatâs ever been mine.

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it now, now, now
