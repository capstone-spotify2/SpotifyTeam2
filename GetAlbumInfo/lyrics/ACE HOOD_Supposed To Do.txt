What am I supposed to do, now
Now I know itâs you, that I love? (Tell me, tell me)
What am I supposed to do, now
Now I know itâs you, that I love? (Tell me, tell me)

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Still in the make and I wanna be great but they tell me be patient
Don't compare me to none of these niggas in the game
Cause they way too basic
And I'm just that amazing, I reach them stages
In the league with the majors
Nigga fuck your blogs, nigga fuck your statements
The fuck you thinkin'
Nah, ain't doing no more favors
Never hit a nigga just to make me famous
Little nigga, flows go crazy
And them other nigga's can't tame me
Flame me, blame me
All the nigga's that doubt it
All ya'll nigga's some cowards
All ya'll nigga's step up and get devoured
Six feet deep with bouquet of flowers
Tell me what, what am I supposed to do
Cause respect for mine is so overdue
I'm the best in it, just pay attention, take a closer view
Cause ain't nothing like them and ain't nothing like you
These niggas changed like Clark in the booth
Can't trust ho's, I don't trust dudes
I buy your bitch like pay per view
I set the standards, I dare you to
What's competition, come show me proof
This God flow, this Jesus Christ
That's say a prayer before I sleep at night
I'm still sinnin', don't be offended
My dick intended for a Spanish wife
This chess homie, not checkers niggas
Ain't playin' with ya, no action figures
What am I supposed to do?

<i>[Verse 2: Skepta]</i>
They keep telling me I'm the best in the country
And I like how that sounds
You think you Superman, I get the Kryptonite, and bring you right back down
Yeah, you know the drill, I kill MC's til it's overkill
But how many more am I supposed to kill
Til niggas stop putting my name
Next to these just come rappers, I'm so embarrassed
I'm in the booth working my magic
My nigga in the studio, heard my lyrics and put his hands on his head like Khaled
These other MC's need practice
Cause when I heat up, it's a madness
Hundred degrees, niggas melt like plastic
Lyrical war, yeah that's my language
I turn Super Saiyan, bitch
Just so you know I ain't playin', bitch
I heard nigga's like you before
You got a good flow, but you ain't sayin' shit
Just a bunch of words with no meaning, no heart, no feeling
But when I lay it down, I lay it down so nice
It's my name everybody screamin'
And we don't care what it cost
Me and my nigga's, we all gotta floss
Don't give a shit how you talk round' here
Better talk properly when you talk to the boss
You amateur, say you got fans online, few shows, and a manager
Think you've got the game on lock
I press start, here comes new challenger (challenger)
Skepta

<i>[Verse 3: Ace Hood]</i>
There are some serious rumors around
There's a new sheriff in town
Fuck your apologies, back up his arteries
Bury him deep in the ground
Tell him keep sleepin', I'm never defeated
I will not repeat it, you follow me now?
Look in my eyes, you can tell that I'm ready
You rappers are puppets, then tell them I said it
Don't give a fuck and this shit is embedded
My flow is infected, I may need a medic
Tell me who better, I make you regret it
It's in my genetics, your shit is pathetic
What am I posed' to do but be great
Never let a thing stand in my way
Never let a Devil ruin my faith
And there ain't a such thing as "I can't"
You looking at a rare breed, a new species
I walk right through hell in my sneak's
Show me the devil, I show you the rebel
I show you my heart when it come to the medal
Tell me who better, I never will settle
My nigga's just told me don't let off the pedal
Keep my Jordan 5's on their neck
Fuck whoever got next, fuck your fame dog and respect
You don't know what life was like in the projects
Ever seen the look in his face before death
I seen my granny before her last breath
Ain't no calm down on my compound
There's no contest cause I'm bomb threat
No conscience shit on my mindset
I bought two choppers for my sound check
Say, 'who wanna war' and I'm coming alone
Spray at you haters like fuckin' cologne
Starvation 3 outta let out the beast
So it's bone appetit and I'm ready to feast
