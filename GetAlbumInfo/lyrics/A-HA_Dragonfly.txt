I will never let you down
I will always be around

In the time we are here 
We'll see love disappear 
Don't ask how
Don't ask why 
Just fly, dragonfly 
Just fly, dragonfly

I will never bring you down
I will always stick around
I will heat you when you're cold 

In the time we have left 
We'll raise eyes to the sky 
Don't ask how 
Don't ask why 
Just fly, dragonfly 
Just fly, dragonfly 

Don't ask how 
Don't ask why 
Just fly, dragonfly
Just fly, fly, fly dragonfly
