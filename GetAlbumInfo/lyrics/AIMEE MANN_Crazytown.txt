I guess this movie mustâve opened wide
another girl who threatens suicide
you called the cops but then she denied every word
and you know youâll be the one whoâs paying the tab for her
youâre out there trying to flag a cab
and for who?
a girl who lives in Crazytown
where craziness gets handed down
Who? whoeverâs gonna volunteer
will only end up living here

A plot like this will always have a twist
the girlâs a dream who never did exist
just like the last one, and she enlisted a fool
and you thought, Oh, itâs all fun
when youâre writing songs for her
but now son, youâll be posting bond, and for who?
a girl who lives in Crazytown
where craziness gets handed down
Who? whoeverâs gonna volunteer
will only end up living here

and you donât want to go that route
cause thatâs not what youâre all about
but you just canât seem to get out of it
youâre still out there, raising a doubt,
and for who?
a girl who lives in Crazytown
where craziness gets handed down
Who? whoeverâs gonna volunteer
will only end up living here
