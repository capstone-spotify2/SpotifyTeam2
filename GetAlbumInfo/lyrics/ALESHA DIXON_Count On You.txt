Oh, why?
You're the one, I wanna say it
Oh, why?
This feeling's gone much deeper down
Now you got me where you want, I'm hypnotized
You got me where you want and know it
Take you there and keep it real
In your arms, the place that I belong

Can I count on you, baby?
You're always gonna break me heart
Can I count on you, darling?
You're always gonna break my heart

Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on you?
Can I, can I count on you?

Oh, why?
You're the one, I wanna say it
Oh, why?
This feeling's gone much deeper down
Now you got me where you want, I'm hypnotized
You got me where you want and know it
Take you there and keep it real
In your arms, the place that I belong

Can I count on you, baby?
You're always gonna break me heart
Can I count on you, darling?
You're always gonna break my heart

Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on you?
Can I, can I count on you?

Right up, <i>[?]</i> 

Can I count on you, baby?
You're always gonna break me heart
Can I count on you, darling?
You're always gonna break my heart

Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on
Can I, can I count on you?
Can I, can I count on you?
