A-L, Now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
Cuz He is and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Nuclear power plants and missiles, real warfare
This where the wealthy need welfare
I'm an immortal man on healthcare
My cautious conscience give me nightmares
I stopped dreaming many eons ago tho
I paid my dues and rocked the bells like Quasimodo
On the low tho, Soulo only artist on crown without a solo album in the stores tho
I got my opinions
What do you suggest?
It's been a drill to be ill, you ain't really sick
Who you a-mucinex?

A-L, Now I lay me down to sleep

H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
'Cause He is and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

Muthafuck the government
Muthafuck the system
Muthafuck you, I'm just living..

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Aye man, I'm sorta a rock and a hard place
Like a guitar in the Hard Rock Cafe
They argue about me in barber shops when I got cropped
Hmm... What a paradox
I'm borderline crazy with a stamped up passport
Getting past TSA with shit stashed, smelling like a hundred ashtrays
Little white kids asking for my autograph
Hey man, I'm off half a xan, off to my aircraft

<i>[Ab-Soul (Kokane):]</i>
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
'Cause he is and I am him (Soulo)
Yes he is and I am him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

Muthafuck the government
Muthafuck the system
Muthafuck you

So I say, so I say, so I say, catch another plane
Represent my hood in every state up in the USA
I'm feeling good today, feeling good to be from D.A
I had to do it

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Back to the music, back to the fact I'm actually stupid
Stupid meaning genius, come suck Jesus' penis on Venus
Back to reality, sadly I'm actually Jewish
Or whatever you wish to call me, I don't wanna offend nobody (l'chaim)
Just remind them all, that it's real
Like when the Ark of the Covenant is still
Foolish humans this is faith without the H
The work is never done dummy, the lazy will be late
A stewardess who was familiar with my music said: âYou must be living the lifeâ
I looked at her with my red eyes like:
"I ain't going on no vacation
I ain't going on no vacation
I ain't going on no vacation
'Till I fulfill my vocation"
