All the way back in history
how the girl thinks is a mystery
spent our lives cruising the bars
venus girls and the men from mars
So in all this time did you ever think do the girls sees red
when a man sees pink
and your best lovin is in the past and cause somewhere slow is nowhere fast

Your Outta your head
so out of your head
stay out of your head...
your out of your head
so out of your head

bricka bracka firecracker sis boom bah
here comes trouble in a push up bra
his style is sharp as a coffin tack
but out of your box &amp; your way off track
your a mile away on a mental binge
your catasphrophe is of a lunatic fringe
your still put together its tit for tat
you say its all good but its more than that

Your Outta your head
so out of your head
stay out of your head.........
No out of your head
so out of your head
stay out of your head

So in all this time did you ever think think think think
Your Outta your head
so out of your head
stay out of your head.........
No out of your head
so out of your head
stay out of your head
