You'll beat me?
Bring it on! Bring it on!
You're gonna save the day?
Bring it on! Bring it on!
You ready?
Bring it on!
I'll show you another thing or two!

You may think your clever but you're not
You better get the coffins out!
Trust me kid that's where you're sleeping tonight!

There's no guarantee we'll get out alive
Stop your whining! Let's get busy!
Baby, it's time to lock and load!
Stop your whining! Let's get busy!

Welcome to the show,
it's a story that you've heard a thousand times
So take a seat and get lost with me,
this tale will never stop being told
Welcome to the show,
it's a chance to save the world or lose the girl
Let's save the world!
Heroes will save the day!

You may think you've won but I promise you it's not over!
You may think you've won but I promise you it's not over!

This could be our one last chance to finally rise up
So here we stand and here we will fight
None of us shall run (None of us shall run)
from anyone
Storms are gathering

There's no guarantee we'll get out of alive
Stop your whining! Let's get busy!
We have to rise above and fight
We'll be heroes!

Welcome to the show,

Heroes will save the day!

This is the part where you are supposed to scream! <i>[x4]</i>

When you scream we'll be heroes

Welcome to the show,
