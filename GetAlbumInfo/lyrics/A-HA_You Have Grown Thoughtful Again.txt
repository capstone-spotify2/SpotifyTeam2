Hah, yeah
Carrumba

I fail to understand you
I don't know if you are lonely or just con me
And I don't see how you can say
That friends are few and far between
So tell me who you've seen

You have grown thoughtful again
I can't say I like it
You have grown thoughtful again
Not you

I'm shaken and in two minds
You say things that are not the way I say they are
And you don't see how I can say it
Friends are few and far between
And tell me where you've been

You have grown thoughtful again
I can't say I like it
You have grown thoughtful again
Mum? Can't say I like it

You have grown thoughtful again
I can't say I like it
You have grown thoughtful again
