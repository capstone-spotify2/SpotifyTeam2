Konvict (Konvict) 
Ohhh, ohh, ohh, ohh 

Just one look in the mirror 
And I know I don't look the same being alone 
I don't walk the same without you on my arm, I lost my charm 
I don't know how I made it before 
Cuz you are my future for sure 
And now that it's over I dont know how I'm gonna get by 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
With no more you <i>[x2]</i>
What am I gonna do? 
with no more you 
To see me through, 
with no more you 
What am I gonna do? 
with no more you 
Can't believe there's no more you 

I look at my passenger side 
And there's nobody to ride with me for life 
It feels like the end, I lost my friend 
I can't sleep at night, 
Because your side ain't occupied 
The hurt in my eyes, won't go away 
I'm in so much pain 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
With no more you <i>[x2]</i>
What am I gonna do? 
there's no more you 
To see me through, 
with no more you 
What am I gonna do? 
there's no more you 
Can't believe there's no more you 

Don't know if I can make it or not 
Everybody sees that I'm going through a lot 
It's hard being alone, 
When you used to be on top 
Call for you, there's no more you 
I stop for a minute then I pinch myself 
I can't believe I'm here by myself 
I can't do anything without your help. 
Call for you, there's no more you..Ohhh 

<i>[Chorus: (x2)]</i>
With no more you 
What am I gonna do? 
there's no more you 
To see me through, 
with no more you 
What am I gonna do? 
there's no more you 
Can't believe there's no more you 

No more you 
What am I gonna do, 
there's no more you 
To see me through, 
No more you.. 
What am I gonna do, 
there's no more you 
Can't believe there's no more you <i>[x3]</i>
