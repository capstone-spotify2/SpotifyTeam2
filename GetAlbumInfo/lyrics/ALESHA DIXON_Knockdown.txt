Hey
When I lay it all out on the table
Don't know what is stopping me
From feeling like I might be able
To enjoy my own company
Sitting up by my window
Watching the summer rain
The world goes by a in minute faster
Than I can keep up today

Knockdown
Everybody in the place say what now
Ya souls feeling shot down
Lucks out
But ya gotta carry on
Speed it up now
Woo Woo Woo Woo
Knockdown
Everybody in the place say what now
Ya souls feeling shot down
Lucks out
But ya gotta carry on
Speed it up now

Oohh yeah I got the feeling
That something could happen now
Ohhh I got the feeling
That something could happen inside my life now
And have you ever asked why you've been here before
Cause only you have the power to carry on through that door

Knockdown
Everybody in the place say what now
Ya souls feeling shot down
Lucks out
But ya gotta carry on
Speed it up now
Woo Woo Woo Woo
Knockdown
Everybody in the place say what now
Ya souls feeling shot down
Lucks out
But ya gotta carry on
Speed it up now
