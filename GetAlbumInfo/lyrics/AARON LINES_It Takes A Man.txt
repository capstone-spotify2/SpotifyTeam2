She locked her fingers
Bowed her head
She said I'm late
And I'm really scared
You can go
But I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it
Either way
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child

Laid my head
Down on the wheel
She said I know, I know
It don't seem real
She closed her eyes
But the tears broke though
She said don't hate me
For loving you

In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child

I could not reassure her
Couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand

In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child
