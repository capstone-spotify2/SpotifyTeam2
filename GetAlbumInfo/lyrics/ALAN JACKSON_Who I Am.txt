Well I know you hate my drinkin'
And the way I talk sometimes
But you hate it most when I don't call at night

And it's just because you love me
And you worry 'bout your man
You do the best you can with who I am

Burnin' both ends of a candle
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through
Is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
Sweetheart, I understand
You do the best you can with who I am

You go to church on Sunday
While I'm still home in bed
Sleepin' off the night I had before

And sometimes you say I'm perfect
And sometimes not worth a damn
You do the best you can with who I am

Burnin' both ends of a candle
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through
Is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
Sweetheart, I understand

You do the best you can with who I am
You do the best you can with who I am.
