<i>[Hook x2: Ace Hood]</i>
(We don't fuck with you, nigga)
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
(We don't fuck with you, nigga)
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
(Don't fuck with you)
You can't sit with us, you can't hit the blunt
Just to tell the truth, we don't fuck with you

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
I can smell that fake from like a mile or two
Only smoke that loud, and not that reggie, mayne
I got all my whips in all my bitches names
Standin' on your sofa, nigga, fuck your couch
Niggas like some bitches, they just run their mouth
Askin' all them questions, boy your mind gone
Boy you must be workin' for the 5-0
Niggas out here ballin' for a season
Watch these bitches, they are so misleadin'
This real nigga air you cannot breathe in
I just want you to give me a reason
I, don't fuck with these niggas
I say now I, ain't lovin' these bitches
Cross my heart and hope to die

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]</i>
I love my alphabets, all I smoke is Ls
Yeah, C+ is the police, I don't fuck with 12s
I spent too much money on the package for the scale
I need my money up front cause I don't trust the mail
I'm gon' rip this beat apart if the bass good
My block is like a deck of cards, Ace Hood
I wanna know just who you are and if you taste good
I can go anywhere I want because my face good (A1)
Got this lil' bitch I jump up on like a skateboard (kick, push)
Every time that I need some money, I take some
She'll suck my dick and go and kiss her nigga
Stop it, my Pan 4-door, fuck you, hit my middle finger

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Ace Hood]</i>
Just know my circle small and I don't trust nobody
We gon' have to weigh that money, too much profit pilin'
I just love to stunt on all my old hoes
I do not fuck with that bitch, she cannot keep her legs closed
I'm runnin' the game, I'm fuckin' them lames
Forrealla, forreal, that head was insane
But all of these niggas be frontin'
All of my niggas be stuntin'
Livin' this life and we love it
We gettin' this money, I keep it 100
Say I, don't fuck with these niggas
I say, now I, ain't lovin' these bitches
Cross my heart and hope to die
