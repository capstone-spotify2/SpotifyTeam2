Body bag! <i>[x4]</i>

Yea, yeah, you lookin' at the realest in the flesh
Name a nigga fuckin' with' me
Who you know hit rock bottom then bounce back like you wouldn't believe?
And now I won't allow 'em to breathe
The boy got a chip on his sleeve
They told me I would never achieve
And now them niggas a leach, like they a part of the team
One thing about it though I been ready
Know the money gettin' old call it grand-daddy
Ace on the beat call the paramedics
Only rap nigga in the game lookin' athletic
Boy couldn't be defeated with a shoe fetish
Spend cash at the dealer never do credit
First with the red Rover let the streets tell it
Only ride with the G's if it shoot steady
Got a lot goin' on in this cold world
Got me prayin' every night for my little girl
And my little boy growin' up too fast
Daddy hustle so I can give ya'll the whole world
Couple whips in the crib for my old girl
Laughin' at you hatin' niggas like you Will Ferrell
Bad bitches in the pen make my toes curl
Long ways from the days of the broke era
Tell the team that I got us, bet the house on
Just remember what I said when it's that moment
I ain't even impressed with ya stats homie
Mention my name on the list with the greats on it, ball
Rims on the jeep sit tall, still I spend a house in the mall
I done seen it all
Police out shootin' everybody
Every other day another body
Pull up on the scene, another black man gunned down
God rest his soul to Mike Brown
Another black man gunned down
God rest his soul to Mike Brown
I done seen it all
... Nigga I done seen it all
... Gotta understand yo' laws
... Better know ya rights and ya laws
Nigga I done seen it all
