Wish that I could say these words tonight
Wish I have the courage, wish I might
Have the chance to show you, speak what's on my mind
While you're right next to me
I've loved you from the start

Wish that I could walk you down the road
Share each moment, have my hand to hold
My imagination's beginning to unfold
Every wish is granted, every dream and hope

Wish I may, wish I might
Find a way to your heart
Wish that I'll be the sun to warm you all through your life
Wish you may feel my love that is hidden in the stars
Wish I may, wish I might
Be the one

Maybe now I'm ready to be found
Then I'll be a part of who you are
Promise of forever, never break your heart
Always there to listen, always by your side

Wish I may, wish I might
Find a way to your heart
Wish that I'll be the sun to warm you all through your life
Wish you may feel my love that is hidden in the stars
Wish I may, wish I might
Be the one

(Wish I may, wish I might
Find a way to your heart
Wish that I'll be the sun to warm you all through your life)

Wish you may feel my love that is hidden in the stars
Wish I may, wish I might
Be the one
Wish I may
Wish I might
Be the one
