There's a chill in the evening air
Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending

Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
One for life and one for love
And all you've given me
For the dreams you made me dream again
And all that we can be
Holding you tonight, holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
