Bucket full of tears
Baby, know I'm here
I'm here waiting

Close your precious eyes
And just realize
I'm still fighting

For you to be with me
And sit under this tree
We can watch the sunrise
We can watch the sunrise...

Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day without you

I know it feels like no one's around
But baby, you're wrong
Just get rid of the fear
Promise that I'm here
I'll never be gone

So baby come with me
And we can fly away and we can watch the stars shine
And baby you can be my love, oohh.

Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day without you
Without you
Hold on I promise it gets brighter
When it rains I'll hold you even tighter
I won't go another day without you
Without you

This is me tonight
There's no more games and no more lies
And I know it's right
Cause of the way you look into my eyes
And when I hold you tight
The worries disappear I'm glad you're in my life

Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day without you
Hold on I promise it's gets brighter
And when it rains I'll hold you even tighter
I won't go another day without you
Without you

And I won't go another day without you
