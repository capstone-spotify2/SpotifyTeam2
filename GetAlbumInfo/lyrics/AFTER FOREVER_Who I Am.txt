You hypnotize me 
I do not dare to look 
You mesmerize me 
Don't even dare to feel 

I want to have it just to prove I can take control 
I want to have it just to show them I wont be fooled 
I take it 
I break it 
I'll force you 
Just to let them know who I am 
Who I am 

I'll softly touch this 
I'll fire up this flame 
I'll hold on gently 
It's time to leave the game 

I want to have it just to prove I can take control 
I want to have it just to show them I wont be fooled 
I take it 
I break it 
I'll force you 
Just to let them know who I am 
Who I am 

I want to have it just to prove I can take control 
I want to have it just to show them I wont be fooled 
I take it 
I break it 
I'll force you 
Just to let them know who I am 

Oh, I want to have it 
Just wait and think it over 
I break it, I take it 
I don't want to push it 
I'll force it 
Just to let them know 

That is not who I am 
Who I am
