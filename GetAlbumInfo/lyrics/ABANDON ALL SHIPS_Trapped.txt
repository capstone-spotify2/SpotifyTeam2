The holy water that you soak in is poison
Save yourself from all the lies that you drowned in
Pay us for your petty redemption
Paradise it comes at cost
Born free in a world of condition
My faith in humanity lost

I sit alone and wonder why
Where do we go after we die

Where the hell would we be
If we didn't truly believe that
Heaven is a place on earth

My body was a temple that I choose to destroy
Waiting on a savoir a plastic decoy
Twenty four seven three sixty five
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

This house is haunted
I hear the sound
Of my faith being taunted
By souls that are bound to all the unwanted
Faceless people around, faithless people around

I sit alone and wonder why
Where do we go after we die

Heaven, heaven is a place on earth

Where the hell would we be
If we didn't truly believe that
Heaven is a place on earth
