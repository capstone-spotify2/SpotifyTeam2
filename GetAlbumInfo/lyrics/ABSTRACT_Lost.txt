It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might've strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

I was told to get lost
So I got lost for years
Found myself in the mountains
Became one with my fears

Moved with the wind
Changed my mood by the weather
Drifting through miles which headed wherever
While drifting through smiles fake as trees in December

But the path I traced backs not the path I remember
Cause to me love's a 4 letter forever word
To her it's a promise 'til better occurs, but I'll be me
'Til my heart beat hit the delete on my world

So feed me all that I need if I give you the world
That's a promise, hope you heal it when I've lost it
When my vision ain't as polished, if I got you then I got it
Until then I'll be mobbin'

Making music steady rockin'
Hope you roll through
Searching far and wide till the day that I find you

It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might've strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway <i>[x2]</i>

But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found

Cause I put up walls hope I let em down for you
I know I've lost a couple they'd be quick to say it's true
Can't stand still I always gotta make the move
Cause my ambition is a blessing and a curse in what I do

But spending nights at home alone I tend to think of you
All I got is my fam', a couple friends, and all my views
Shout out to my fans and everything they helped me through
Saying that that's all I have is selfish hope that you excuse

But I can't lie I really want back that real love
When life gets cold I need that real touch
Connection is a real rush
I fiend for something more than lust

Fiend for something more than trust, more than buzz, more than drugs
Cause there's no better drug than another one to share your life with
Made sacrifices that I seem to fight with

I hit the highway searching for god knows what
Hope that all that is to be I didn't make what was

It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might've strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway <i>[x2]</i>

But I will be found
I will be found
When time comes down
I will be found

So I keep running 'til my run is gone
Keep on riding 'til I see that dawn
I will be found
I will be found
