Ladies and gentlemen 
Are you ready for this one? 

Coming back with a different swag 
Flying high with the UK flag 
I'm in America, brand new tracks 
Lady MC with the ?? 
I'm making delicate diamond hits 
Transatlantic ?? 
Can you hear m e 1, 2, check 
And in my Carnegie dress I rock with the best 

I bit the apple of pop pop music 
I've been chained up and then ?? 
Wanna get out, wanna get down 
Then if you hear me let me hear it out 

I'm breaking out 
Come if you dare 
Let's paint this down 
Hands in the air 
It's going down 
Oh not, oh yeah, oh yeah 
If you're with me let me hear you say 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 

Here we go now 

I'm hearing you, hot speaker ?? 
I'm now an animal that's out of control 
It's just how I roll, back to the ?? with Alesha ?? 
Set the ?? DJ is being next 
See the people jump up, see you're impressed 
Can you hear me 1, 2, check 
Can you hear me 1, 2, check 

Knocking it down and I'm taking a risk 
Putting it back to the rhythm of this 
Back in the club tearing it up 
You wanna see me, yeah, you wanna touch 

I'm breaking out 
Come if you dare 
Let's paint this down 
Hands in the air 
It's going down 
Oh not, oh yeah, oh yeah 
If you're with me let me hear you say 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 


It's a party, all the girls being dressed in Bvlgari 
Looking out like it's a safari 
Ready to bounce, ready to crank this party 
Feeling the drum ... the base for me 
I'm on a new tip fresh like my lipstick 
Cherry bomb that crack goes ballistic 
Don't wanna miss this, yeah you wanna kiss this 
I'll be the priority on everybody's guest lists 
Oh yeah Oh oh 

If you're with me let me hear you say 

I'm breaking out 
Come if you dare 
Let's paint this down 
Hands in the air 
It's going down 
Oh not, oh yeah, oh yeah 
If you're with me let me hear you say 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la
