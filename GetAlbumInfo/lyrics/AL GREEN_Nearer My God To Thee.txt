Nearer, nearer

The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation sang in a tune
In the hall, it was loud and clear

All of the crowd that stood all around him
They were crying as I could plainly see
Oh, the songs that they sang was so touching
They were singing to my God to Thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Kept on singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Sometimes, I like to be in company
But when I get out, I like to stay out for long
Song is the only thing that can control me, Lord
When I know trouble, trouble's about to come

I fall down on my knees and call God late at night
And I know He'll make my, my burdens alright
I tell him, Lord, I have a desire to be
Nearer, nearer my God to Thee, Alleluia

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

I remember I was a little boy
Mother still used to <i>[?]</i>
I used to wonder what my mother was doing, have mercy, Lord
I stepped out one morning found mother all folded up

And mother had to rise up, she was looking towards the sky
And I saw the tears as they fell down my mothers eyes
And I can still hear the song mother was singing
Nearer my God to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee
