I have seen ten roses bleed,
seen new petals fall,
I have felt my soul tear.
I have felt nothing at all.
Watched what was vibrant
fade as shadows fall.
I can see it's been done,
all that was pure has been eradicated.
I can see, it's all done.
Nothing can erase the damage done.
I have seen ten liars love,
seen two lovers lie,
seen youth, blinded, smiling.
I have seen deceit handed down.
From the highest height, below the lowly.
I can see it's been done,
all that was pure has been eradicated.
I can see, it's all done.
Nothing can erase the damage done.
I have seen beasts bathed in glory,
tread across the angels as they crawl.
Take it all away.
Regress to nothing.
Can someone please take
these images from my mind?
