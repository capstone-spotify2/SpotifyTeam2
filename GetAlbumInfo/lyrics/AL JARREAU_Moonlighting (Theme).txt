Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Nothing could change you
Set and sure of the way
Charming and bright
Laughing and gay
I'm just a stranger
Love the Blues and the Braves
There is the sun and moon
Facing their old, sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Something is sweeter
When you meet 'long the way
There is the sun and moon
Facing their old, sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
So come walk the night
Come fly by day
Something is sweeter
'Cause we met 'long the way
We'll walk the night
We'll fly by day
Moonlighting strangers
Who just met on the way
Who just met on the way
