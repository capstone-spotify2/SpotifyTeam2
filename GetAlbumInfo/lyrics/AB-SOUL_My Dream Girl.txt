And grab a glass and move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Yeah, yeah move your hips
Go ahead, move your hips

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
And do what I wanna do to her
And she would never tell me "No"
She would tell me go far as I want to go
Anything I need just let her know
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (moe)
She would even catch a tiger by the toe
Just to put a smile on the face of Ab-Soul
And that's so amazing
That I know...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
My dream girl...

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
That'd be nice (That'd be nice)
Because she let me take full control
She don't ask no question she just rolls
With the punches and she hold no hunches
I can't wait 'til I doze off
So we can pick up where we left off
(All-I-Need-Is-Her)
That's all...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
Maybe I should fall asleep (fall asleep)
She said "What took you so long?"
"I was starting to think you'd moved on."
I told her "I was busy writing a song."
She said "Bout what?"
I said "Bout you."
She said "Don't lie."
I said "Baby, it's true."
She said "So what, let's do what it do."

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
My dream girl...

Grab a glass and move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Just move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Grab a glass and move your hips
Just move your hips
Do it like this
Like this ma, left to the right
Left to the right, I said
Like this, left to the right
I mean left to the right
Boom...boom
It fade out...
Cut...
Did I get it though?
