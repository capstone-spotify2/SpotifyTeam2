No youâre not small
Youâre big enough to fill my heart
Surprised myself when I made room for someone else
Whoâd ever though Iâd fall so far to pull myself back up
Life can be crazy sometimes

I was filled with hope
When I saw your face
I just canât be sure
If tomorrow will be better babe
One thing that you should know
One thing that you should know

Is I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go

Thereâs a lot of minds who tell you how to think and fell
And a lot of times pull you this way and that way
If not around, listen to what your heart says

Iâm so filled with hope
When I see your face
I just canât be sure
If weâll ever find a better way
One thing that you should know
One thing that you should know

Is I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go

I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
I will never let you go
No no no
Never gonna let you go

Never, never, never let you go <i>[x4]</i>

(Never, never, never let you go <i>[x3]</i> never, never)
Sure a surprise
Iâll be yours and youâll be mine
One thing that you should know

I will never ever let you go
Never gonna let you go
I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
I will never let you go
Never gonna let you go
Never, ever let you go
Never gonna let you go
