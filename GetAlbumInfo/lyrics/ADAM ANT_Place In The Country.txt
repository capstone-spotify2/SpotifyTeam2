All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

You think you're really swinging
But you're off the beat
The move your brains are thinking
Doesn't reach your feet
You got to get this complication out your head
Or find another man instead

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

You listen very close to what the bad girls said
In all those crumby articles and in my bed
They said I'm just a stripper not afraid to strip
I got my brains rattlin' my hips

Ok, Marco, let's hear what you can do

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

You've got the kind of looks
That make a dead man stare
But when it comes to working, honey
You ain't there
I try to tell you nicely but the screaming starts
You're playing ping pong with my heart

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
I've heard enough don't wanna hear no more
