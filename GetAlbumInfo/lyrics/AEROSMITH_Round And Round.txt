if you believe in me
like I believe in you
you wouldn't be tellin' me things
that weren't exactly true
now everythin' changes
ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin' baby
I can't remember my name
cause the life I been livin'
and the love I been givin'
would be sure to set you spinnin'
but you ain't never touchin' ground 
and I'm round and round
well it was one for all
and it was all for one
and everything that we did
never bothered no one
can you remember the days
when you were sweet sixteen
and always caught in the blaze
of someone else's dreams
I'm goin' round and round <i>[x 16]</i>
I'm goin' round and round <i>[x 1,000,000]</i>
