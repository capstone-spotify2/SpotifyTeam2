Some girls awfully risky
And some girls kick in the stall
But givin it up women and whiskey
Yeah you ain't got nothing at all
But a sign on the wall that hung on a tack
Said liquor in the front and poker in the back
And now no more la-onely nights
A ya-ya baby till out goes the lights

If you wanna take a lookie cookie
Tonight might be your lucky nighty night night

How to go dejabooty
You're a yaya baby tonight
Way to go thought you knew me
Yeah but you're not getting it right
But it's cool
Too cool for cats
A little bit of this and a little bit of that

A red hot maybe on a cold summer night
A ya-ya baby till out goes the lights

If you wanna taste the cookie
Lookie tonight might be your lucky

Roses are red, my lips on you
But you couldn't tell by the things that we do
Things that we see are so out of sight
We'll have to see when we turn off the lights

Living in the lap of love <i>[x6]</i>

Living on coochie and romance
Waiting on cupid to call
Some people say that's living
Yeah but that ain't living at all
And it's cool, that's how I roll
You'll get a little loving if you got a lot of soul

And it's for sure, when love's just right
It's ya-ya baby when out goes the lights

If you want a little nookie
Cookie tonight might be your lucky

Roses are red, my lips on you
But you couldn't tell by the things that we do
Things that we see are so out of sight
We'll have to see when we turn off the light

Ooh-aa-oo yeah yeah... <i>[repeats]</i>
