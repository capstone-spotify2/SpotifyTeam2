When the last breath of life is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather around for my farewell party
Won't you pretend you love me

There will be flowers from those who cry when I go
And leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone

Don't be mad at me for wanting to keep you
Til my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you

There will be flowers from those who cry when I go
And leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
I know you 'll be glad when  I'm gone
Yes I know you'll be glad when I'm g-o-n-e.
