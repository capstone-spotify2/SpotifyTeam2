Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy about the idea
Having nothing to do

I'm tired of playing around
Girl in every town
I want to settle down
And stop foolin' around 
(Let's get married)
I've got to stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Stop foolin around
(Let's get married)
You don't believe me but I want to stop foolin around

Let me say it
I didn't mean to say all the things I said (Oh no)
The way I felt in my heart
It came out that way
Let me tell you one thing
Don't want to say anything to drive you away

Let's get married today
(Let's get married)
Yeeaaah
(Let's get married)
(Let's get married)
Alright
Alright
(Let's get married)
Let's get married today

Might as well
Might as well
'Cause take you in my arms and hold you
Take you in arms and squeeze you
Take you in my arms and love you every night
Just make everything alright alright
I wanna soothe you baby 
Let me soothe you baby (again)
Soothe you baby
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
Yeah Yeah
You can know me
You don't believe me
Let's get married today
I found out I didn't, I don't love nobody anyway
Let's get married today
