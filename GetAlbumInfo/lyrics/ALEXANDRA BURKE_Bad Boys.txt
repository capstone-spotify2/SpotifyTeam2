(Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Alexandra Girl I know what you like
(Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Oh, oh (Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Hey, yeah (Bad Boys, Bad Boys)

<i>[Alexandra]</i>
Some people call them players
But Iâm far from terrified
Cos somehow Iâm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life
It feels my heartâs divided
Half way âtween wrong and right
I know Iâm playing with fire
But I donât know why

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Even though I know theyâre no good for me
Itâs the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Oooooh, bad boys

Some think itâs complicated
But theyâre straight up fun for me
I donât need no explanation
Itâs nothing more than what you see here
My heart still feels divided
Halfway âtween wrong and right
I know Iâm playing with fire
But I donât know why

Yeah the Bad Boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Even though I know theyâre no good for me
Itâs the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)

I know you want me shawty cos Iâm a (bad boy)
Hey s-shawty canât help it she so so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet she only sings the crooked letters
Let mamma take all the risks
For that chemistry she like them tougher than leather
Not even the paws, itÂ´s more like a mama bee,
Out lost thatÂ´s on the regÂ´ler,
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, thatâs my world
Itâs not the news itâs what I heard
To get them more the merrier
Itâs not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
Youâll have them shawty donât worry you fly
