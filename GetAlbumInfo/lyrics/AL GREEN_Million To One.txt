All my life I'll spend it with you
All of my days will be for loving you
Each and every night for the rest of my life
I'd be steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

All my life I'll spend it with you
All my days will be for loving you, one more time
Each and every night for the rest of my life
Will be steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

You're one in a million
(One in a million, one is a million)
A million to one
And you're one in a million
(One in a million, one is a million)
I love you, baby

Oh, each and every night for the rest of my life
I feel steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

All my life, all my days I'll spend with you
All of my days, sweet baby, I'll spend loving you
Each and every night for the rest of my life
I'll be steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

You're one
(One in a million, one is a million)
In a million, a million to one
You're one
(One in a million, one is a million)
In a million, baby

(One in a million, one is a million)
In a million, a million to one
(One in a million, one is a million)
In a million, yeah, yeah, yeah

You'll play the part
It's hard to get
You blowing my mind
You blowing my mind
I will never, never, never, never, never play

You're one
(One in a million, one is a million)
In a million, a million to one
You're one
(One in a million, one is a million)
(That's what you are)

Oh baby, you are a
