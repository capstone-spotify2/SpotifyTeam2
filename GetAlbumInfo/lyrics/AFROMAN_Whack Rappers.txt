This next song is dedicated to all wack rappers

If you don't gave a damn gon' throw it out {What}
If you don't gave a damn gon' throw it out
The windoooooooooow Up against the wall!
Up against the wall, Laugh when the motherfucker fall
These fools can't rap at all
I never buy your tune from The Neptune
When they beat come on I hope it go off soon
Fabolous? What's Fabolous about it?
I think you terrible, music unbearable
Ripping off Ma$e
With that look on his face
Aw man, I rest my case
Kelis, wow
I hate her so much right now
"My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard"
Who gave her a record deal? Oh my God!
Nas is in the video with Kelis
Jay-Z is in the video with Beyonce
Both of these rappers are wack
Yet people talk smack about forty Belafonte
The music industry is using the slang
And try to play it off like they doin' they thang'
Come on Camrom
Oh boy Oh boy Dipset Dipset Oh boy Oh boy
How can you be from a city so black?
And bust shitty lyrics that Whick Whick Wack
Get back on Kelis
Oh yeah Kelis 
This is what I want you to do
Get on your knees, face me
I got a milkshake for you and it's tasty
Just like your album
Puff Daddy, Enough already!
Now it's P. Diddy

How can your group be called 'Da Band'
Nobody plays an instrument man
I dont play B2K
R&amp;B singers Be Too Gay
You know they broke up over money
Oh yeah
Thats too bad I don't Care
I think its good, no doubt
They can stop putting all that bullshit out!
Like what
What a girl want, What a girl need
A fuckin' job and a brand new hair weave
What a girl want, What a girl need
A fuckin' job and a brand new...

Bump Bump Bump

Bump Bump Bump
That's my song That's what I wrote down on a piece of paper
Bump Bump Bump
Call up Puff Daddy ask him if he wanna do a verse with me
Take that, Take that

Real Pimps get down on the flo'
But I don't see a hoe, In the video
I know, Why is David Banner runnin' from The Clan?
What happend to the bitches man?
Hmm.. Cadillac on 22's
Why is David Banner taking off his shoes?
It's suppost to be about Cadillacs
Not David Banner bringing dead people back
Even though its all good
It might get misunderstood
Dance skippy Miss Hippy is the hood
Raps Im writing up, I can't lighten up
Until these wack ass rappers tighten up
Missy Elliot thinks she looks like Halle Berry
That scary
Her CD aint worth it
Pur your money in your pocket and reverse it
Her CD aint worth it
Pur your money in your pocket and reverse it

Hers go up and down, like a peanut
She could be pretty
If her atttude wasn't so shitty
Talkin about "Ya trying to come through the back do'"
She aint got no back do' what she talking smack fo'? 
Male bashing with Mary J
Like Queen Latifah she must be gay
In my radio you gets no play

I don't know man, Look at 50 Cent
He don't move his mouth when he rappin' man

<i>[Talks like 50 Cent]</i>
Open Yo' Mouth!

'I'll teach you how to Stunt'
Teach me how to Stunt?
They need to let me teach em' how to roll a fat blunt
Get high, get drunk and take it easy
And stop making songs so cheesy!

But the worst rapper I ever heard man
Is the wack ass motherfucking Birdman
