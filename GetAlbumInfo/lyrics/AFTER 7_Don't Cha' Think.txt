Don Parks, Daryl Simmons and Kayo
I'm having fun, but all that I've done
It hasn't always been right
They say I misuse, that I break the rules
But that won't get me uptight
Now they're telling me, what I could
Never be
Always tryin' to bring me down
But I'm so strong, I'll prove them wrong
No matter what they say, I'm telling you 
Right now

Don't you think it bothers me 
If you think It bothers me
It will never bother me. Oh No!

Oh...oh...oh...
No

I've been around. Been up and down
This roller coaster of life
Now people see what all I achieve
But there are some who still try
To criticize, I don't know why
But I think that it's jealousy
But I was strong and proved them wrong
Cause nothing in the world will ever
Bother me!

Don't you think it bothers me 
If you think It bothers me
It will never bother me. Oh No! <i>[x4]</i>

Times are hard but I've got to make it
Tried to bring me down but I had to take it
The road is rough and I'm here to tell ya
I've had enough, not givin up
I never believe the things they say about me
Nothing in life is ever going to stop me
Jealousy, envy, don't want to make an enemy
Keep on, keepin on to the top

No...No...No...No...

Don't you think it bothers me 
If you think It bothers me
It will never bother me. Oh No!
