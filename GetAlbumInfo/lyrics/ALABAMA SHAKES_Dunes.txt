Somewhere over the dunes, love
I walk, I wept
Enough
I turn the desert into sea, babe
I swam from the terrible dust
I don't know whose problem it is
I don't know whose love to give
I'm losing it

Somewhere in me, a memory that I cannot gather anymore
Oh, my word
Oh, my, my
Quiet and empty

Oh, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I don't know what to do about it
When I'm not so sure about it

I don't know whose problem it is
I don't know whose fuck to give
I'm losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
