<i>[Hook:]</i>
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black &amp; Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Smoke til' I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black &amp; Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Hot box like Pacquiao packed in the steamroom
That's ain't eucalyptus you sniffin' it's weed fool
We in this mufucker thick ass high like my bitch
Gimme room like a Motel 6 or meet your doom
And tell em' this, I got more participants that think it's just a myth
Adjust your mutherfuckin' stereo
So I can drop the bomb on you and watch your fuckin' ears explode

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
All we do is do it <i>[x10]</i>
(Nigga squadddd)

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I'm the highest nigga at the bottom of the totem pole
And I ain't sweatin' shit man, I'm cooler than where sodas go
Fuck so and so long as Soul show up ho!
Tell do' po' up I'm finna go in (go in)
Blowin' L's not takin' L's go win
Do a nigga squad you will not survive
You ain't on this side? You are livin' lies
Put two and two together, I'm the one, high five
Mobbin' like I'm tryna catch a case
The dick make your chick jaw drop Ma catch your face
Eatin rappers on a plate like Etouffee
I do this everyday this verse is a 8th of ye'
When you look at me what do you see?
If I wasn't in Black Hippy I'd be the 4th Fugee
Unruly, seekin' redemption in light of Tookie
The game is all ours like violent movies

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black &amp; Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Smoke til' I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime
Black Panther party reincarnated, y'all hate it
Niggas tryna put a hex on me like the Star of David
Everything I say is real
Got a few jewels in high places you know the deal
Fuck you niggas talkin' bout?
Your run is over like the Oprah show walk it out
They say I'm really out my mind mane
All do is get high and play mind games
This is my game I payed off the referee
Been fouled since I was born like Jeffery
The only MC with telepathy
Fuck that the only celebrity in 11-D
I swear to God it won't be long
I have Tyler lightin' bongs and recitin' Psalms
I'm an angel with' an angle what I mean well
I'm just a demon that means well

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Hey Ali you know what they call me?
You know what they call me Ali? Huh?
Black lip bastard
Big bitch
