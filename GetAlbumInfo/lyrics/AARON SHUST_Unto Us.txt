Unto us a Child is born
Unto us a Son is given
God with us, go and tell
Emmanuel has come from Heaven
And His name will ever be
The Prince of Peace
The Wonderful Counselor
He's the Great and Mighty Lord
Bow before our Holy Savior

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Unto us a Child is born
Hope to all the world
Unto us the Son of God has come
Sing Hallelujah
Everlasting Father
Name above all names
God is with us
Sing Hallelujah

Unto us a Child is born
Unto us a Son is given
God with us, go and tell
Emmanuel has come from Heaven
And His name will ever be
The Prince of Peace
The Wonderful Counselor
He's the Great and Mighty Lord
Bow before our Holy Savior

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Unto us a Child is born
Hope to all the world
Unto us the Son of God has come
Sing Hallelujah
Everlasting Father
Name above all names
God is with us
Sing Hallelujah

He's the Prince of Peace, He's the Mighty God
He's the Savior born to set the captives free
He's the Promised One, the Messiah come
And His love will reign throughout eternity

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Unto us a Child is born
Hope to all the world
Unto us the Son of God has come
We will sing Hallelujah
Shining in the darkness
Light to all the world
Unto us the Son of God has come
We will sing Hallelujah
Everlasting Father
Name above all names
God is with us
Sing Hallelujah
