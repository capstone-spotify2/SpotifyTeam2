Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there

Well I climbed back on that eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, the shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill
And see the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there
He's always singing there, Hank's always singing there
