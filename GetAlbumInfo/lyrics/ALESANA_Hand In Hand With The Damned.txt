I don't trust myself
I'm trapped drowning in despair, (I'm poisonous)
I slammed the door and locked it shut and now disaster plagues my thoughts.
Let's drink to the dead, (I'm poisonous)
Cheers to what's ahead!

Sweet temptress!
I can see it in your eyes,
You're moving on without me!
(So it ends tonight)
I guess this is goodbye!
Selfishly you say you're better off without me.
(And it ends tonight)
Well baby save your breath.

Won't you please have mercy?
Before you push me away let me try to change your mind.
Oh wanderer!
If you think this is fun just you wait until I'm done!

Blessed fortune screams "Why have you forsaken me?"
(There's no escape) I never should have lost my way.
And now I'm stranded out at sea chasing a lie
(There's no escape) I'm losing the sky.

Sweet temptress!
I can see it in your eyes,
You're moving on without me!
(So it ends tonight)
I guess this is goodbye!
Selfishly you say you're better off without me.
(And it ends tonight)
Well baby save your breath.

Imprisoned soul seized in the chamber of feculent horror.
Suffer all you must but suffer silently.
Still your cursed tongue, stay your blighted abandon.
In your eternal death you hunger for rotten mire.
For in your mortal life it was this which was your gift to man.
Prepare to walk hand in hand with the damned.
God can't help you and angels won't save you!
Your unrequited prayers will be in bane of your existence!
Prepare to walk hand in hand with the damned! <i>[x3]</i>

I am poisonous!
Is there a way for me to say that you should stay?
I need to know you'll miss me when I'm gone.
I'll cherish you until the day I die!
A twisted way to make you mine!

I can see it in your eyes,
You're moving on without me.
(So it ends tonight)
I guess this is goodbye!
Selfishly you say you're better off without me.
(And it ends tonight)
Well baby save your breath.

Won't you please have mercy?
Before you push me away let me try to change your mind.
Oh wanderer!
If you think this is fun just wait until I'm done!
