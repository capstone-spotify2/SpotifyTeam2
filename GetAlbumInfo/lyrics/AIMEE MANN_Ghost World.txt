Finals blew, I barely knew
My graduation speech
And with college out of reach
If I don't find a job 
It's down to Dad and Myrtle Beach

So I'm bailing this town
Or tearing it down
Or probably more like hanging around
Hanging around

Everyone I know is acting weird  
Or way too cool   
They hang out by the pool  
So I just read a lot and ride my bike 
Around the school  

'Cause I'm bailing this town
Or tearing it down   
Or probably more like hanging around   
Hanging around 

And all that I need now is someone 
With the brains and the know-how
To tell me what I want... anyhow

12th of June, a gibbous Moon
Was this the longest day?    
I'll walk down to the bay     
And jump off of the dock and watch   
The summer waste away    

Then I'm bailing this town  
Or tearing it down     
Or probably more like hanging around   

Then I'm bailing this town    
Or tearing it down      
Or probably more like hanging around   

Hanging around
Hanging around
Hanging around
So tell me what I want
