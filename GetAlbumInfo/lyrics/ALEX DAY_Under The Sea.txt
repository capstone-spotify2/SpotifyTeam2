The seaweed is always greener
In somebody elseâs lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you looking for

Under the sea, under the sea
Darlinâ itâs better
Down where itâs wetter,
Take it from me

Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotinâ
Full time to floatinâ
Under the sea

Down here all the fish are happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ainât happy
They're sad 'cause they're in a bowl

But fish in the bowl is lucky
They're in for a worser fate
One day when the boss gets hungry
Guess whos goinâ be on the plate (uh-oh)

Under the sea, under the sea
Nobody beats us
Fry us and eat us in fricasee

We what the land folks love to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles life is the bubbles
Under the sea, under the sea
Under the sea, under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally

Even the strugeon anâ the ray
They get the urge anâ start to play

We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Uunder the sea

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they're soundin sharp.
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul

They ray he can play
He lings on the strings
The trout rockinâ out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where itâs at
Anâ oh that blowfish blow

Under the sea (under the sea)
Under the sea (under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine itâs music to me

What do they got, a lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here under the sea

Each little slug here
Cutinâ a rug here under the sea

Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
Thatâs why itâs hotter under the water
Ya' we in luck here
Down in the muck here under the sea!!
