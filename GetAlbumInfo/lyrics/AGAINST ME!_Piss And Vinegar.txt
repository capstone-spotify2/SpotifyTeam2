I've heard the hype about your band, Ive seen your video playing on the TV. 
Publicity photos in magazines, no none of it makes me feel anything. 
I would be lying to you if I did not say something. 
That would make me feel like a politician. 
A middle of the road opinion that no one finds offensive or challenging. 
I'm not interested. 
The stage is not a pedestal. 
I don't think your bad people I just think that your aesthetic is horrible. 
Please treat me with the same respect and candor. 
I would appreciate the honesty. 
A little less professional, a little more upfront and confrontational. 

Just say what you're thinking.
Say what you're really thinking.
