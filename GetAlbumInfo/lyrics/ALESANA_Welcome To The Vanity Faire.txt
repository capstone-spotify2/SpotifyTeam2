I search high and low but I canât find you
Still your vexing laugh entices me
Close enough to touch but then you run away
Iâm about to quit and then you say, âlose yourself in the vanity faire!â
Insanity is whispering to me, woah!
What I believe is just not making sense of what I see
Show me your reflection, a sly disguise, is it the girl you want to be?
A porcelain smile, youâre a knockout, baby?
Drape yourself in fragile fantasy
I see your reflection, a sly disguise, and itâs not the girl your want to be?
A fraudulent smile
What you see is what youâve asked for,but itâs never what you are
A cold-hearted tale
Lost in a maze of beautiful deception
And just like before Iâm at the mercy of a phantom
When will it end? How will it end? And will you be in arms?
I just canât take anymore of this pointless search for nothing
Insanity is whispering to me woah!
What I believe is just not making sense of what I see
Show me your reflection, a sly disguise, is it the girl you want to be?
A fraudulent smile
What you see is what youâve asked for,but itâs never what you are
Hey hey hey!
Silence, oh cruel harlot!
Silence! Your filthy tongue will be stilled!
Laughter echoing, Iâm unraveling tonight
Silence! Iâve had enough!
Silence! No longer will you stop me!
Your vanity so patiently will steal your soul
Youâre hideous..
Mirror, mirror on the wall, a liar to us all, youâll be the one to fall
The eye of the beholder knows the truth
Show me your reflection, a sly disguise,Is it the girl you want to be?
A porcelain smile, youâre a knockout, baby!
Drape yourself in fragile fantasy
I see you reflection, a sly disguise,And itâs not the girl you want to be?
A fraudulent smile
What you see is what youâve asked for,but itâs never what you are
What you see is what youâve asked for,What you see is what you get
A cold-hearted tale
Attack the mirrors, shatter the prison
One by one reflections fall, come on come on come on come on!
Until I destroy them all, come on come on come on come on!
