It's too easy to say that nothing feels right
I can make some lame excuse
Say I'll be better tonight
I can let you go on thinking, that its something you've done
But it's nothing between us
There's no guilty one

But there are sometimes, there's no way to explain
And there's no rhyme or reason for the way that I'm feeling this pain
I just get so emotional, so emotional
When there's no way off the floor and there's no-one else's door to lay the blame

Keep my eyes closed, my tears weren't meant to be seen
I'm fragile like a small bird caught in the wind
And I can't bear to pretend anymore
Too anyone
Its just one of those days and there's no guilty one

But sometimes there's no way to explain and there's no rhyme or reason for the way that I'm feeling this
Pain
I just get so emotional so emotional
When there's no way off the floor and there's no-one else's door to lay the blame

But there are sometimes there's no way to explain
And there's rhyme or reason for the way that I'm feeling this pain
I just get so emotional so emotional when there's no way off the floor and there's on one elses door to
Lay the blame

And there's sometimes there's no way to explain and there's no rhyme or reason for he way that I'm
Feeling this pain
