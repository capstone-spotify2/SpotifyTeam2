How can I celebrate when I'm not with you
Snow is falling, falling to the ground
I can't smile, I can't sleep
'Cause you're not around

This Christmas make my wish come true
I'm waiting patiently
Santa if you're listneing
Bring my baby back to me

'Cause he's on the call of duty
Serving our country
He's making it a better place
For all of us to be

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
I'll see you soon
There's no Christmas without you

It's Christmas day,
Get your gifts under the tree
'Cause all the bags and fancy shoes
Don't mean a thing to me

The only thing I really want
Is to have you home safely
So baby, baby
Why don't you come home to me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
I'll see you soon
There's no Christmas without you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
I'll see you soon
There's no Christmas without you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
I'll see you soon
There's no Christmas without you
