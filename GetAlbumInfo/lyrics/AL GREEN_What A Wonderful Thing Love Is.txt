What a wonderful thing love is
I can see you standing there now
And you're the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who'll be laughin' loud but me

You made me see the love that you're givin' me
Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kinda makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man

And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me
Baby, I don't know about you
But let me tell what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you (baby)
With you, baby, yeah,

(I wanna say)
I been cryin' without your love
The night time find me Wetting my pillow,
But I (yeah), I don't, I don't mind, no, but if you,
You just let me say it again
I've been cryin'
I wish our trouble would leave me alone
But, I've been cryin'
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now (yeah)
Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain (yeah)

Baby, baby, yeah
What a wonderful...
