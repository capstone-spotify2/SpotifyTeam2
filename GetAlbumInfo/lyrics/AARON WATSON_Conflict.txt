Out with the old.
And in with the new.
That's what they say,
Those who don't have a clue.
You're fighting this rain.
You're willing the shine.
You can't help yourself.
But i know you are trying.

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

Still chasing a dream
You're facing the facts
The weight of the reel
No more regrets
No looking back 
The problem to big
The tower to high
Yes says the heart
But no says the mind

When your heart and your head disagree

Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict

I wish this world apart
Where I could give you all the answers
But the fight continues on
And the fact of the matter
Is I am convinced we all 
spend far too much time on the fence 
Choosing sides
Tell me which is right

When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Tell me how to resolve this conflict
