Mister luck, mister front
You're always kidding your way through
Mister you, missed again
Though you wanted to

But I wouldn't catch you
No, I would be the one who
After all is laid inside out
In the bed that you made

Say the dirty pretty words, you say
Never gonna mean a thing
Oh, say the dirty pretty words, when you say
What you say, I'm not listening anyway

Out of luck, out of front
Is that what you wanna do?
Out of your head again
Is that what you're going through

But I wouldn't catch you
No, I would be the one who
After all is laid inside out
In the bed that you made

Say the dirty pretty words, you say
Never gonna mean a thing
Oh, say the dirty pretty words, when you say
What you say, I'm not listening anyway

Ever wonder where everybody goes
All the liberties you're taking
Take a look around, did you ever stop?
Maybe you should start changing

Dirty pretty words, dying on your tongue
Here we go again, there you go again
There you go again

But I wouldn't catch you
No, I would be the one who
After all is laid inside out
In the bed that you made

Say the dirty pretty words, you say
Never gonna mean a thing
Oh, say the dirty pretty words, when you say
What you say

I say the dirty pretty words, you say
Never gonna mean a thing
Oh, say the dirty pretty words, when you say
What you say, I'm not listening anyway
