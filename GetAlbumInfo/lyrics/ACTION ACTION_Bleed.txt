You're not listening, so why should i talk to you
Why should i understand, why should i follow through
Out of luck
Out of time
Out of hopelessnes
And sleepless nights ahead
Not asking for this strange situation
Not asking for this trite vaccination
Not asking for this genius complication
Are you loving
Or leaving
Or lying
Or dying away

(i've got to get the hell out of here,
Get my shit off the ground, knock this place down.
So far, far away, i just bleed...don't ask me to repeat...)
