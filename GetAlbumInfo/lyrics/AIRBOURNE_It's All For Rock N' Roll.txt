Aw. C'mon! 

He did it all, enough for you and me.
Played rock n' roll hard fast and free.
Full speed ahead like a bullet train.
Lost sleep 'till death, his ghost still haunts the stage.

It's all for one and one for all.
Together we stand; together we fall.
'Cause it's all for one and one for all.
It's all for rock n' roll.

Around the world he left his mark.
A million eardrums shattered like a glass.
There was no surrender. The stage is empty.
So raise a glass and have a drink with me.

It's all for one and one for all.
Together we stand; together we fall.
'Cause it's all for one and one for all.
'Cause it's all for rock n' roll.

All for one. One for all.
All for one. For rock n' roll.
All for one. One for all.
All for one. For rock n' roll.

It's all for one and one for all.
Together we stand; together we fall.
'Cause it's all for one and one for all.
Together we stand for rock n' roll.

All for one and one for all.
Together we stand; together we fall.
'Cause it's all for one and one for all.
It's all for rock n roll.
