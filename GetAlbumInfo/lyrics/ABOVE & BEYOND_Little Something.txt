Too many hours on the road
Too many days as you grow older
And tears are spilled

As each moment unfolds
Your head is resting upon my shoulder
And I'm quietly thrilled

Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you're supposed not to forget?

You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me

I used to fear what you'd bring
I didn't know if I could love you
The way you'd deserve

You make me feel like a king
A day is no longer what I get through
You're my everything

Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you're supposed not to forget

You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me

You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me

If I could turn back time
I'd be there for every minute
I'd give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it

If I could turn back time
I'd be there for every minute
I'd give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it
