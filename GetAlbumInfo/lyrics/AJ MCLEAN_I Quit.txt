You're always bringing me down
Why did I always stick around
You tell me how to feel, tell me what to say
Say I gotta see things your way
Gotta make a change
Gotta get away from my biggest mistake

It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
You can't fire me I quit
Can't fire me I quit

How does it feel to be wrong
Stuck on stupid for so long
So why you gotta yell, don't you think I heard
You always gotta have the last word
You say you're gotta leave but let me be the first
To hit you right where it hurts

It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
You can't fire me I quit

I can't believe that I
Put up with all the lies
The fights
The sleepless nights
Now baby it's my time
Gotta move on with my life

It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
You can't retire me
You don't inspire me
You can't fire me I quit

You can't fire me I quit
You can't fire me I quit
