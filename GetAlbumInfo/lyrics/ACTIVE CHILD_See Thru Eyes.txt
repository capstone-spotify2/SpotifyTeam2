She threw her arms around my neck
Whispered softly in a foreign tongue
Her eyes were see-through
Tell me your secrets
We drove my car into the night
Turned the corner and the streets were wet
I couldn't see you
Tell me your secrets
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
When we awoke the room was bright
Her body glistened in the morning light
And now i see you
I know your secrets
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
