So glad you could make it 
So glad you were here
And if you never lied to me
You have nothing to fear 

I don't care where you're going
I don't care where you went
Because I think we've got a case of 
My last will and testament

So tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
I don't wanna read it 
In Vanity Fair

Let's make this real simple,
Let's clear away the fog
Because I think we've got a case here of 
The tail wagging the dog, ohhhh

Shut up, shut up 
Oooh... 
Shut up, shut up

Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Here's what you've got to do

Take my arms
Take my legs
Take the rest
Wrap around it, woman 

So tell me that you love me
Tell me that you care
I don't wanna read it
In Vanity Fair

Let's keep this real simple,
Let's clear away the fog
Because I think we've got a case here of
The tail wagging the dog, yeah
(Shut up, shut up)

Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Here's what you've got to do

Take my arms
Take my legs
Take the rest
Wrap around it, woman 

Now here's the deal (here's the deal)

It took me 9 months to get older
For all my apparent sins
It took me 9 months to get out of it
The rest of my life trying to get back in, ahaha

Truth is not a strong point
Truth is your offense
So, if you wanna talk to me
Stop using the past-tense

I'm sick of all your problems
I'm sick of your bad luck
So if we ever meet again
Then I suggest that you should duck, ohhhh

Shut up, shut up
Just shut up, you better shut up
Shut up, shut up

Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Here's what you've got to do

Take my arms
Take my legs
Take the rest
Wrap around it, woman 

Just let your love run through me
Just let your love run through
Just let your love run through me
Here's what you've got to do

Take my arms
Take my legs
Take the rest
Wrap around it, woman
