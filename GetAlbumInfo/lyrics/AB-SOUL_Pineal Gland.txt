<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Uh, It was all a dream, I swear it never happened
I wrote like Edgar Allen, I was po' like Edgar Allen
Let me hit the weed, you know I really need that
Missing screws, bending rules like kneecaps
I don't even know what's real, I'm just being real
Making moves, you just another human being; being still
Play the fool, you jealous dudes are just a plate of food
Tell the truth, I'm the coldest cat, sabertooth
Blaze the booth, blaze the buddah, this ain't hookah
You hit this shit a few times, you might see the future
Ask my nigga Blocka, we be rolling up that Blanka
Just retire, if I light this fire I might blow your block up

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Enjoy your mind trip but don't trip on your mind
No man is safe from the war going on outside
That's right, you ever been conscious in a coma?
Please don't tell my mama this ain't marijuana
I might be tripping off that DMT
TDE, Limitless like we on NZT
I made my dreams reality, so to speak
Or so they say, I could still be asleep

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
The black sheep running with a pack of wolves
Diamond in the rough, tell Brock I need a pack of woods
Two white cups full of codeine
Plus I got two white sluts down to blow me
Can't you see I'm floating, like root beer and ice cream
My synapses act like lightning, probably why I'm so enlightening
Probably why these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm lookin like "who the fuck invited them?"
They failed in testing like what's inside of them
(Soulo, Soulo) Say it like you mean it
My demeanor is the meanest, I'm gettin meaner by the minute
It's mine, I spend it, my mind is spinning
Your time is ticking, the sky's the limit
We in a space where matter don't matter
Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns
Shitted in a crater last time I sat on Saturn
Got a letter from Andromeda, they tryna shrine my bladder

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
I'm in a whole 'nother realm, go to hell
Last nigga tried to scratch the surface broke a nail
Last nigga tried to cross the line got crucified
We overseas, back-to-back, never wore Chanel
The new nucleus never sitting in a cell
Genius idiot, best description of myself
I'm in a fucking lab coat rhyming as high as shit
When I die, donate my organs to science bitch

<i>[Outro: x3]</i>
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, but you can never see us
