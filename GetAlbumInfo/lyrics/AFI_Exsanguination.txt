Welcome the whole new pain and take comfort in what you've become.
I waved as I passed myself along the way.
I have arrived so unashamed but my reflection no longer seems the same.
It seems much dimmer now... it seems so dim. Just stumble and fall into a world that's over crowded.
And you will find me. Won't recognize me; and I won't recognize myself.
I've arrived so unashamed, but all my senses no longer seem the same.
I can sense everything. My sight's so clear. 
In an instant, my life just slipped away, I fought for life, the whole time you were holding me down.
You watched me dying. Holding me down, you brought my rebirth.
