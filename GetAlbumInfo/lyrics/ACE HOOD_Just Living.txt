Okay
Keys to the benz
Breeze in the wind
Chicks get a tan
LVâs in the lense
Fresh like some homemade drinks in the fridge
Gotta keep a bad chick, click and her friends
I'm just living my life, neck full of ice
See the rims roll like the game of the dice
Plus it came with the pipes, came with the top
Had to get it sliced, like a head full of lice
Nevermind was the price, cop it on site
Neck looking like a city fell full of lights
I'm a made ass nigga, bank and bigger
Only 19 when I seen 6 figures
Lord knows Iâm a sinner, knows my dilemma
Keep a thick knott, in my hard blue denim
Let the hot water simmer, friends turn bitter
Hope a nigga fall when they scream out timber,
I be cool like the winter, no Decemeber
Two bad chicks, that's a two piece dinner
Ridin in a benz, Iâm a Rose sippa
Pour a little out
R.I.P my niggasss

Uh,
Okay I came in the game, pray for the change
Click that I claim, put the name on the chain
Couple years of the fame, life ain't the same
Plenty champagne, first class on the planes
And it got a nigga laid, I just feel I'm in the daze
Music that I made, I just started gettin praise
Everyday I pray, god keep me in the wave
Never let it phase, now I'm really gettin paid
See a nigga swag, courtside Heat game
Probably routin on my nigga Lebron James
The homie Dwayne Wade, just lookin out for the fay
Jay that's in your face, the champs is on the way
Swoosh I'm in the coupe, oops there goes the roof
True my bitch bad, and ass as thick as a nuis
My cash will introduce, my swagger in the room
Hit a couple of buttons, and the engine will vroom vroom
Shorty frontin to fuck, sheâll kindly get the broom
And its facts so don't assume
Man you niggas are after, like noon
And tell my moms new crib, got plenty of rooms

Ye, Eyy, Hahaha
We on our way to the good times baby
