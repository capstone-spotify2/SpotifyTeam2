Father
My wings are clipped
See the steps that made me trip
Now I'm so lonely

Mother
Time's frozen flame
Seem to linger in the rain
Holding me only

Like a river I'm flowing
And there's no way of knowing
If I'm coming or going
I need something to chain me down

But it don't matter
My eyes have seen...
For better
Out of blue comes green

Mother
I have gone wrong
Work my fingers to the bone
All I've been doing
Father
Proud that I am
To be born into such hands
Your love so renewing

And I know I can lose it
Part of life...you can't choose it
As I touched the horizon
It just felt like I'd die soon

Don't matter
My eyes have seen
For better
Out of blue comes green
