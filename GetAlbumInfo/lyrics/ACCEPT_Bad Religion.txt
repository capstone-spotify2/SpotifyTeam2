As long as I remember - I was left all by myself
When trouble crossed my way I stood alone
My old man hit the bottle - my mom was running scared
The old forgotten prayers turned to stone

I'm searching for identity - I don't show who I am
The past  has cast a shadow over me

Like a bad religion - the only one I know
I never had no shelter - never had a place to go
A bad religion - my life is make-believe
Bad religion - I'm beggin' for relief

I tried to break the circle - to break the vicious spell
But the past is always heavy on my mind
I'm dancing with the devil - a dangerous romance
A daring way to leave it all behind

I'm searching for identity - I don't know who I am
The past has cast a shadow over me

Like a bad religion - the only one I know
I never had no shelter never had a place to go
A bad religion - my life is make-believe
Bad religion

I need someone to talk to - someone to understand
I need a friend to lend a helping hand
I'm gonna pull myself together - shed this battered skin
I'm ready for the challenge - this loser's out to win

Like a bad religion - the only one I know
I never had no shelter - never had a place to go
A bad religion - my life is make-believe
Bad religion - I'm beggin' for relief - bad religion
