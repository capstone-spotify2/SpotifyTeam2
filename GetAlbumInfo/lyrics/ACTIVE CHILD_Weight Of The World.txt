Thereâs a beat, in the street and heâs calling your name
Try and run, try and hide, but thereâs no one left inside
But sometimes, itâs a lonely one
But in your eyes, I feel the weight of the world
Thereâs a queen on a scene, and sheâs calling your name
You can run, you can hide, but you probably wonât survive
So you reach and you clutch to the things you can remember
Of the scent or the touch of the one you miss so much
But sometimes, itâs a lonely one
But in your eyes, I feel the weight of the world
Feel the weight of the world
I feel the weight of the world
Sometimes, itâs a lonely one
I feel the weight of the world
