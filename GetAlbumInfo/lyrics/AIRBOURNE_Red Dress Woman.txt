I got a red dress fever
And it's driving me wild
I can't get enough of her
She's always on my mind
Some wanna paint her picture
And others want her number
But me no, I just wanna take her out
And get her under the covers
Forget the wedding gown
Don't need a ring to hold me down

I need my red dress woman
My red dress woman
Oh she's my red dress woman
My red dress woman
Tonight!

Now I got her in my arms
And we're walking to the beat
Yeah the sun is setting slow
On the hot summer street
She got me down on my knees
When or what she's doing to me
I said honey! Where did you get your dress?
She said she got it for free
C'mon forget the wedding gown
Don't need a ring to hold me down

I need my red dress woman
My red dress woman
Oh yeah she's my red dress woman
My red dress woman
Tonight!
Alright guitar!

She's my red dress woman
My red dress woman
She's my red dress woman
My red dress woman
Alright she's my red dress woman
My sweet red dress woman
Oh yeah! She's my red dress woman
My red dress woman tonight
