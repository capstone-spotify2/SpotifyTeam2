If you walk in the red light at night
In the black velvet hour
If you look you will see their delight
They're the purest of flowers

They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk
Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk

What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows
What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows

They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

Illusions for your mind 
They are just illusions for your mind...

Theyve got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk
Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk
