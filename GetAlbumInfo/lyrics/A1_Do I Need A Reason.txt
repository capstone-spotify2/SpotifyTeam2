Today when I saw you 
I knew it was just like the first time
When you met my eyes I came close
And I felt like the first time

To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
Iâve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
Iâm scared of falling into deep this time

Do I need a reason to tell you why
Iâm singing you this song
Do I need a reason to show you that
I know where I belong
Whenever I am weary I lean on
this feeling that I have
I am so much stronger now
Thankful, yes I am

Today Iâll renounce them,
the doubts and the fears Iâve been nursing
Iâll fly like a moth to the flame
and Iâll feel like the first time

To hold back my fear
and let you come near
Iâve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and let you come near
Iâm âfraid of loosing and still I go
