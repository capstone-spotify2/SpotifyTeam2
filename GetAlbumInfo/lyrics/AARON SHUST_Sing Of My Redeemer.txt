I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love for me
On the cruel cross He suffered
From the curse to set me free

I will tell the wondrous story
How my lost estate He saved
In His boundless love and mercy
He the ransom freely gave

I will sing
Sing of my Redeemer
With His blood
He has purchased me
On the Cross
Jesus sealed my pardon
He paid the debt and set me free

I will praise my dear Redeemer
His triumphant power I'll tell
Of the victory He gives us
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my Redeemer
His Relentless love for me
He from death to life has brought us
Son of God with Him to be

We will praise the Lamb for sinners slain
For His blood can wash away our stain
Singing glory, glory to His name
For His blood can wash awayâ¦
