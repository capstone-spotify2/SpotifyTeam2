Why do I feel it's all up to me to see that
everything's right and it's how it should be
Why don't they just leave me alone
I've got to prove I can
Little girl with stars in her eyes they've
got her all figured out and there's nowhere
to hide why can't they all see who I am
when will they understand

It may take some time they don't know how
it feels because they can't read my mind
They always say I'm too young and they 
feel they should help me
But I can make it all alone out here on my own

Every day I feel so in demand and all I
wish I could find is a place I can land
One day I'll feel comfort inside cause I'll
know who I am

I can hold the line if I know in the end
that I won't be left behind I don't regret
what I've done I don't think you can blame me
Now I'm standin' all alone out here on my own

I'm not thinking 'bout leavin' home
But I need to be on my own
Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone
I won't even ask them why
I can't ever let them see me cry
Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own...
out here on my own

Feeling lost in a world full of lies
I can't help thinkin' that love is just 
passin' me by Hold on to what I believe
and keep an open hand

Can I have it all if there's no one to 
turn to when I stumble and fall
Is there a secret I need because no one
has told me-all alone

It may take some time cause I know
how it feels to have a lot on your mind
I'll never feel all alone cause!
Know that I have me
Now I can make it all alone out here on my own
