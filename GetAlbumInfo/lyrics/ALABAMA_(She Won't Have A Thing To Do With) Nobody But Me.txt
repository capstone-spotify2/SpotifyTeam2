The way she's walkin',
Starts talkin' among the boys hangin' out
They want to take her out
But she won't have a thing to do with nobody but me.

The way she's looking got those hips cooking
Got their heads turning, got their hearts burning
But she won't have a thing to do with nobody but me
Now, she won't have a thing to do
With nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me,

She's my woman, she's my lover
Ain't nobody gonna get no part of her
They can look but they can't touch
The woman I lay down at night and love.

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Ain't no danger of a stranger ever getting closer
Than these arms that hold her
But she won't have a thing to do with nobody but me.

Now, she won't have a thing to do
With nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me.
Now, She won't have a thing to do
With nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me.

Nobody but me, nobody but me, no, no, no, no, no, no, oooo, ooo, ooo...
