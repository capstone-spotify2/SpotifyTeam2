You took to the light
And they call you a fool
You think it's alright
Its all part of the rules
But don't look away
Till you've seen the light
Or they'll get to you
Well if you wanna stay
Then do what you gotta do

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
See the light and you will find the answer
Morning, night anytime
See the light and you will find the answer
Morning, night anytime

If you see the light
You wanna give up
Cause they're gettin to you
They say live it up
And stop being a fool

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If you see the light

<i>[Chorus]</i>

If you see the light
And you do it right
And shake things up
And just get it right
Don't be a fool
Play it cool
Just get it right
Look to the light
Yeah!
