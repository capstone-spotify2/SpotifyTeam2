Wherever I go, wherever I see, I'll remember ya'll, if you remember me.
Wherever I go (wherever I go), wherever I see (wherever I see), I'll remember ya'll, if you remember me.

Love the way the sun hits yo face,
When blowing through your ass no shine around your waste
How you make me wanna leave but you begging me to stay
Don't you know I gotta go why you getting in the way.
Taught me there are limits to the life yo live
But when I'm round got me feeling like I ent done shit,
I just wanna make you proud so tell me are you now,
Guess it's how it goes when your from a small town. 

Wherever I go, wherever I see, I'll remember ya'll, if you remember me.
Wherever I go, wherever I see (yeah), I'll remember ya'll, if you remember me.

If you remember I'll remember y'all
I will remember, remember me and I'll remember y'all

Wherever I go (wherever I go)
Wherever I see (wherever I see)
I'll remember y'all, if you remember me
I will remember, you...
