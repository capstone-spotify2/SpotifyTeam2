The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end, yeah
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To sir with love

Those schooldays are
Of telling tales, biting nails are gone, oh
But in my mind
I know that they live on and on, on and on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who had been so good to you?
Well, it's not easy, oh but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love

The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end, oh, oh
And as I leave, yeah
I know that I am leaving my best friend, oh, oh

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
Oh sir, with love, yeah, yeah, yeah
