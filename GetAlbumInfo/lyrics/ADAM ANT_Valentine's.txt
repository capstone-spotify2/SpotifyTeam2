I bought you flowers, to smooth things over
By the time they died, the time they died
The armistice was over
I bought you roses, red ones
To try and chill you out, trouble is
I bought you flowers, to smooth things over
By the time they died, the time they died
The armistice was over

I bought you roses, red ones
To try and chill you out, trouble is
I know the answers
Before you spit them out

Is this love, or just a habit
If it's love, I never had it
Pray for serenity so no one has to care for me
No I know where the pain is
I know where the hurt is
I know where the problems lie
Is this love, or just a habit

Was I like a frightened rabbit
Caught up in the headlight of your smile

I bought you flowers, to smooth things over
By the time they died, the time they died
The armistice was over
I know you think i long for pastures new
Believe me I want to be with anyone
Anyone but you just my bad behaviour
Four letter words my saviour fuck it
May the last words you hear be mine
And every day a valentine

We know where the pain is
We know where the hurt is
We know where the problems lie

Don't expect kindness from strangers
A life that's free from danger
Pray for serenity
So terrified of losing me

I know where the pain is
I know where the hurt is
I know where the problems lie

I know you think it's tragic
To heal it with black magic
