We can have a day from here, if you'll take your heart put some faith in ideals. The bank line will all turn around and rent will pay itself. You can sleep tonight, little boys in sweat-shops will again be children and tonight they'll eat the lions share. Bombing skies will sing silent and the anger turn to laughter. On the crucifix Christ will turn his head and admit his own sin he was a martyr for. Your shoulders just as heavy there is no mercy from three holes and a bleeding forehead helping my life. Rob the promise and direction given to me. We're bound to self righteous living. Fingers rapping on the counter, patience wearing thin. It's just another work week, arthritis at 18 for a minimum living. Who has time to breathe, catch it before it's over, catch it before it eats you. Hello perspective this is just the human condition. It's universal love my god I think it's spreading. They'll kick you when you're down. Push you down when you're stumbling. Another day of dying is just evolution. You said freedom was a hope away an hand or a hard push. Is this inclusive thinking? We run by a thread, tongue in cheek idealists. I'm not giving up the claim that I can save the world and all I need is my friends.
