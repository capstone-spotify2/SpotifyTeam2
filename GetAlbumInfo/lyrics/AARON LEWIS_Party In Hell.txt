I've been hard up and torn down, the things I've been through
And the angels won't take me... away
And I've talked to St. Peter, he won't let me pass
So it looks like I'm going today.

So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Waylon and Whitley as well
And The Devil will be dealing' the cards as they lay
So let's have a party in hell

And washed up, and worn down, and down on my knees
The angels won't take me... away
The bartender only serves brown liquor in hell
And that sure sounds like heaven to me

So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Janis and Jim Beam as well
And Rick James will bring all the cocaine you want
So let's have a party in hell

So let's have a party and tell 'em we're home
There'll be no-show and Junior and Merle
And Jamey Johnson will be drinkin' from a brown paper bag
So let's have a party in hell
