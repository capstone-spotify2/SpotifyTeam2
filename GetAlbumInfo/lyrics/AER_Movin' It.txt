<i>[Intro - Carter:]</i>
You can hear the party from a mile away
Unmatched smile got the style and grace
So if you wanna move lets find the pace
Walkin up like by the way
Hey lady what it is?
Scoop 'em up, no sweat, 81 degrees
Gymnast body, no flyin' trapeze
Have your friends bring they friends like one two three

<i>[Hook - Dave:]</i>
Donât give it up so fast
I could show you how to groove with it
Donât give it up so fast
Ey girl, keep movin' it
Donât give it up so fast
I think I might choose you miss
Donât give it up so fast
Everybodyâs still doinâ it

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Thereâs moves to be made and I was made to make moves
Thereâs lotta talent here that needs to break loose
On the floor with four girls so thatâs eight shoes
Didnât see that shake so lemme get take two?
Oh shit Iâm at the bar again
And this my own tux didnât borrow it
I told that chick Iâm an artisan
On a trek to find out what karma is, cuz Ha!
All it really was was one dance
Initiated by one glance
And it was just common sense
And I gotta admit Iâm a little bit impressed
Itâs a story bout a girl ill survive to tell
Seems like Iâm alive and well
Looks like Kelly K from saved by the bell
These are rhythmic secrets we ainât never gonna tell

<i>[Hook - Dave]</i>

<i>[Bridge x2 - Carter:]</i>
Girl shake that body, thatâs why youâre here
What else you gonna do girl? I thought I made it clear
Go on shake that body, what else you gonna do?
Thatâs what happens with the FAM crew

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Well I donât care if sheâs driving
Takin me home we in private
Make sure I wonât be drunk dialin'
Chemistryâs keeping all night and day
Iâm one of the son of a guns
Who can get a good nun to get up and get drunk
Iâll end up with a mom and a blunt at your spot
Iâm takin it straight w a couple of rocks
Iâm complacent Iâm not really someone to talk
A face off at 4 in the morning
I know Iâm all for it, so baby lets rock
