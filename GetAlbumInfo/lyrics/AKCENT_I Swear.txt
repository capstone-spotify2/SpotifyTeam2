<i>[I:]</i>
I made mistakes in the past
But then you came along and gave me your trust
Girl, you turned this playa around
You have cleaned my heart form the lost and found.

<i>[Prerefren:]</i>
Yes I know there'll be cloudy days
But I ask, please give me tomorrow
Maybe I cannot stop the rain
But I'll be, I'll be right there...

<i>[Refren:]</i>
I will not let you go
Girl, all my life I swear
You are all that I know
I will not let you down
And for as long as I live
I swear I'll be around.

Sometimes people can change
Sometimes a playa can be played at his game.
<i>[III:]</i>
Baby, I was happy to lose
And I have no doubt, it is you that I choose.

<i>[Prerefren]</i>
<i>[Refren]</i>

(I will not let you go
This is what you gotta know)
I won't let you down,
Girl I'll be around, I swear
(I'll never lie to you
I'll do anything for you)
Baby, you gotta know that I...
I will never let you go...
I'll never let you go...
I will never let you down
And for as long as I live I swear I'll be around.

<i>[Refren:]</i>
Back to me, come back to me
Back to me, come back into my life
My life, I wÃ¯ll not let you go...
