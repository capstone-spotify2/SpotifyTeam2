Just you take your time, ohhh.
Just you take your time.

Do you remember when
we used to take our time
you'd write me a letter, being there
and I'd wait for you all night (ohhh)
Now it seems everyone's
rushing around including you and I
I wanna take a little time
Just to fall in love again
Cause they're telling me...

Just you take your time (No hurry baby!)
Just you take your time,

<i>[Al:]</i>
When I think about yesterday
everything was easy
everything was okay
(Now, now, now)
Now everything is going fast
you're the best thing I ever had
aww and losing you
aww it'd make me, make me
that would make me
feel soo bad (hey, heyy)
Would you help me saying...

Just you take your time (heee),
Just you take your time.

<i>[Al:]</i>
Sing low and take it slow
I'm inclined to agree
Cause ain't nobody living
Can try to hurry me (can try to hurry me)

Just you take your time
Just you take your time

Just you take your time (no need to hurry baby)
Just you take your time (why you wanna rush and worry baby)
