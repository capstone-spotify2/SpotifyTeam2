Look at me
And tell me
You don't love me
Take my hand and say
It can't be
Kiss me once and just
Before you walk away
Listen first to what
Your senses say

'Cause I can see me
Loving you forever
I can feel my arms
Around your life
I can taste your lips
Against my memory
Listen to your senses
What they have to say

Love can hurt
Love can scar you
The time just best
To turn away
But love can heal
And love can save you

Today is not like yesterday

I can see me
Loving you forever
I can feel my arms
Around your life
I can taste your lips
Against my memory
Listen to your senses
What they have to say

'Cause I can see me
Loving you forever
I can feel my arms
Around your life
I can taste your lips
Against my memory
Listen to your senses
What they have to say

Listen to your senses
What they have to say
I can see me
Loving you forever
