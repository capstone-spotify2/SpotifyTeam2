There's softness in the sound
There's sweetness in the way you whisper
When you say "Honey I love you
Is there anything I can Do?"

You've helped me through all my pain
Made sunshine out of rain
And you're the one I'll be in love with all my life
Oh, I thank God for my true, true housewife,

There's times I hear you say
"Honey, there's just no way I'd ever leave you."
You mean the world to me
Our love is locked and you've got the key.

You have given me a world
A little boy and little girl
And you're the one I'll be in love with all my life
Oh, I thank God for my true, true housewife.

When I go out of town
She's still around to greet me
She's waiting at the door
At at a quarter of four in the morning.

She says "I missed you so much
Missed your warm and gentle touch
And you're the one I'll be in love with all my life."
Oh, I thank God for my true, true housewife.

Oh, I thank God for my true, true housewife...
