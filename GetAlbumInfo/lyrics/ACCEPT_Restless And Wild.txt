They're running wild
They're on a down hill ride
Like a rebel they look for more
Too young to die

Now you know your dreams are useless
And there 're lies You'll never tell

'cause you're so
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild

Star born lovers
Angels in the night on a highway
They don't look back
Everybody's lost the way - yeah

The little girl wants to be an actress
Young boys are easy riders

They live so
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild

Stay down - time will roll on
How do you feel when the night is gone
Stay down - time will come 'round
You are the man made for highway life
For the highway life

City lights moving on
No tomorrows - no destinations
Like a wheel turning on and on
You're a man born to run

Every world that you have seen was senseless
Keep moving on there's no other way

Cause you're so

Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
Restless - restless and wild
