When the frantic pace of life attacks me
And weighs me to the ground
I long for someplace to escape
To the one place i have found

No stoplights to obey
No signs or limits there
Just drop the hook
And make your home almost anywhere

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

The gentle motion of the seas
Just rocks me off to sleep
No sirens, cars or screams
just quiet ocean breeze

A frigate bird encircles me
A 1000 feet above
She dips her wing and bows her head
Like we share a common love

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

When the moonlight cracks the edge of night
And stars are everywhere
I can taste the rum and coke
And I can smell that salty air

A light spray across my bow
Cools the evening sun
As it slowly melts into the sea
And tells me day is done

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

When the common themes of life
They come and overload my brain
I steer my thoughts right to that place
That takes me far away

When the traffic fills that concrete path
That takes me back and forth
I usually sit and dream about
That biggest piece of earth

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

Yeah, that's where I belong
Oh, that's where I belong
