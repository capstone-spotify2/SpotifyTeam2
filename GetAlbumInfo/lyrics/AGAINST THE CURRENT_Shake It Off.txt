I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
At least thatâs what people say, mmm-mmm
Thatâs what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates
But I canât make âem stay
At least thatâs what people say, mmm-mmm
Thatâs what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Canât stop, wonât stop moving
Itâs like I got this music in my mind
Saying, âItâs gonna be alright.â

âCause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
Iâm lightning on my feet
And thatâs what they donât see, mmm-mmm
Thatâs what they donât see, mmm-mmm

Iâm dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go
And thatâs what they donât know, mmm-mmm
Thatâs what they donât know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Canât stop, wonât stop moving
Itâs like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, âItâs gonna be alright.â

âCause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while youâve been getting down and out 
about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You couldâve been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
Sheâs like âOh, my god!â but Iâm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Wonât you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

âCause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, Iâm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
