About every time you turn on your television there's another so-called movie star either suing somebody or going back to jail or out of rehab and right back to the bar.

I bet you heard about the two celebrities.
They threw away a fortune on their wedding day.
Looking back they should have fed half the world instead and now they are getting a divorce in LA.

So you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss. 

Oh poor poor little rich girl, her daddy has hotels to burn.
She's got a slogan that's hot, talent that's not, no she don't have a care or concern.
She's got a private jet, videos on the net, and VIP parties every other hour.
She's got her BFF, an entourage, and a chef. Ego bigger than the Eiffel Tower. 

Honey you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss. 

Supermodel, rock stars, hundred thousand dollar cars, treating life like a pleasure cruise.
You know there's not a lot of difference between cheap toilet paper and the supermarket tabloid news.
Now you can throw a hissy fit, you can blame it on the fame, or the pressure and the paparazzi but what we all really need is lots of love from above and a little more and more less vanity. 

So you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
