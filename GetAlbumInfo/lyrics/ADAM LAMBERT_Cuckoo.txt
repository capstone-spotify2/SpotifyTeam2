Feels like I'm having a meltdown
It feels like I'm losing control
They tell me I'm a danger to myself
Now the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

Walk that walk
Like you don't give a fuck
You got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away

I'm swinging off of my hinges
I'm cocked and I'm ready to go
Go on and pack up your thingses
And the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

Walk that walk
Like you don't give a fuck
You got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Lose my mind!
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Gonna get out of this straight jacket, whoa
(Cuckoo)
Gonna get out of this straight jacket, whoa
Yeah!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away
(Lose my mind, gonna lose my mind, lose my mind)
Gonna party 'til they take us away
(Lose my mind, gonna lose my mind)
Yeah, gonna party 'til they take us away
