How about a mega-store
Full of guns to start a war
We're selling toys for fatal games
We'll take the credit not the blame

When they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the sisters
Shoot the mutha's

It's a billion dollar industry
All in the same name of liberty

Guns Or' us
Guns Or' us - big toys buy big toys at
Guns Or' us
Guns Or' us

Living out the fantasy
Buy a dozen - get one free
Radar-guided - laser speed
Devastation guaranteed

Then they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the brothers
Shoot the dog

It's a billion dollar industry
A constitutional guarantee

Guns Or' us
Guns Or' us - big toys buy big toys at
Guns Or' us - get a free magazine with your M-16
Guns Or' us - it's a one-day-sale

Gunned down int he neighbourhood
In the same of brotherhood
Black or white ain't worth a dime
Cut 'em down in zero time

It's shoot to kill - they shoot to kill
It's a human thrill just to shoot to kill

Then they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the sisters
Shoot the mutha's

It's a billion dollar industry
All in the name of liberty
