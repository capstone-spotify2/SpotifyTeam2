I wanted to know who you really are
I needed the chance to stitch up my scars
I'm closer to you then I was in the start
Come dive right in and tear me apart

I'm trapped and we can't get along
I thought that I was strong
We are so unstable
In bed I'm strung out from your touch
But I won't give you up
We are so unstable

I wanted to learn about the dark side of you
You bring me down like a bottle of pills
I hate the way that you're making me feel
I keep coming back I never get you

I'm trapped and we can't get along
I thought that I was strong
We are so unstable
In bed I'm strung out from your touch
But I won't give you up
We are so unstable
We're so unstable
We're so unstable

We're so unstable
We're so unstable

I'm trapped and we can't get along
I thought that I was strong
We are so unstable
In bed I'm strung out from your touch
But I won't give you up
We are so unstable

We're so unstable
We're so unstable
We're so unstable
We're so unstable
