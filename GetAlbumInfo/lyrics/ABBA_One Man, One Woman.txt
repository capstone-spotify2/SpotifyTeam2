No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
You and me, to the end
