Comatose, caught up in the ghost of your touch
I'm holding on, you're already gone, is this love?

Honey, I loved the feeling that you gave to my sickly heart
You wanted space even though we're a million miles apart
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, through and through
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, I.C.U
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you

Open nights to fluorescent lights and the truth
Frozen in my new shielded skin thanks to you

Honey, I loved the feeling that you gave to my sickly heart
You wanted space even though we're a million miles apart
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, through and through
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, I.C.U
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you
(I see you)
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you
(I see you)

And now I'm drugged with the thought of you
Walls built higher just because of you
There's nothing left, I gave it all to you
My heart's still beating and it beats for you
I see you, you

Honey, I loved the feeling that you gave to my sickly heart
You wanted space even though we're a million miles apart
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, through and through
It's time to pull the plug
We're done, I.C.U
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you
(I see you)
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you-u-u
I see you
(I see you)
