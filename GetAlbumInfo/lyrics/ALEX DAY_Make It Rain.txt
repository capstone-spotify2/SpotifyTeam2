There's a storm in my head, it is raging its pain
And the noise it's intoxicating
I will march with the fire that is building inside
And the world better watch out for me

There is no one who will ever bring me down
I will make it rain
There is no one who can ever stop me now
I will make it rain

Every step, every sound, every beat of the ground
Makes me brave I will not be beaten
I've been cold, seen it all, there is no way I can fall
And I know how to charge this feeling

There is no one who can bring me down
I will make it rain
There is no one who can ever stop me now
I will make it rain

There is no one who will ever bring me down
I will make it rain
There is no one who can ever stop me now
I will make it rain
There is no one who will ever bring me down
I will make it rain
There is no one who can ever stop me now
