Wooh yeah ohhh
I said it's just another love story
So let me paint this picture for you real quick
Ahhh yeah

Chillin at the drive-in
Cuties walkin by and
I was in my drop-top
And then I saw her cryin
She had a guyfriend
He was tellin lies
She said her name was Crystal
But she looked just like a diamond
I told her baby girl you're talkin crazy
Your boy's a fool forever actin shady
If that was me you know you'd be my baby
So wipe away your tears and contemplate it

See it when I looked into your eyes
Oh look at those eyes
It was like I couldn't even speak
I just wanted to kiss you so bad
I had to spell it out letter by letter
And I was like

A-B-C 1-2-3
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Skipping class under the tree
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
The chemistry between you and me
Is fillin my heart from A to Z
So A-B-C to X-Y-Z
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G

Ohhh I can't escape it
I try but I can't quit her
The thought of kissing her
It follows me around like Twitter
Ahh she got my brain shook
But I don't wanna stalk her
But all I see are pictures
On my Facebook from her lockers
I know for her it's probably been a while since
Somebody told her that they loved her smile but
Something about her just drives me wild, she's
The type of girl that you walk down the aisle with

And here I am, yet again
Under this magical spell she has on my heart
If only I can find the right words
If only she knew the way I really felt
Then we'll be like

A-B-C 1-2-3
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Skipping class under the tree
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
The chemistry between you and me
Is fillin my heart from A to Z
So A-B-C to X-Y-Z
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G

Ohhh
Got me like ohh
Ohh girl
You got me
Got me like ohh
Yeahh

A-B-C 1-2-3
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Skipping class under the tree
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
The chemistry between you and me
Is fillin my heart from A to Z
So A-B-C to X-Y-Z
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G

Girl ohhh yeah ohhh yeah
Now blow me a kiss baby
