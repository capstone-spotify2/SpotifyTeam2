Ooh, baby
Gotta have your love, yeah, yeah

Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'

Tonight we can make emotions grow, oh, hold me
And I can take you where oceans flow, oh, baby
Love is right here tonight
We can make it come alive

Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'

Tonight we can make the spirit move
Baby, please don't fight it
'Cause we are among the chosen few to find it
Feelings grow when you know
It's all or nothing, me and you, baby

Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'

Whoa, oh, don't stop
When you find romance
You've gotta take a chance

Feelings grow when you know
It's all or nothing, me and you, whoa, oh

Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
