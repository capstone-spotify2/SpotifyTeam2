"Well, step into my parlor"
Said the spider to the fly
"It's really very comfy
But wake up now it's time to die"

"Ohhh ... step into my parlor"
Said the spider to the fly
"It's really very comfy
But now it's time to die"

N-norman was quite nice
But he had this other side
He couldn't lie to Mother
'Cos Mother never lied

They say it's very healthy
To let our feeling go
But sometimes you can end up 
97 feet below 

"Ohhh ... step into my parlor"
Said the spider to the fly
"It's really very comfy
But now it's time to die"

N-norman was quite nice
But he had this other side
He couldn't lie to Mother 
'Cos Mother never lied

When things start to happen 
Much crazier than hell
Be careful when you stay 
Down at the Bates Motel
