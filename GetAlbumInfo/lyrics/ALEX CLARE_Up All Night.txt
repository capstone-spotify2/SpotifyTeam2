Wakin' up in someone else's bed
Was what I was waitin' for.
Oh my days, what have I done?
She saw me sneaking out the door.
What have I been waiting for?
Been wasting all my time,
Watchin' my youth slip away
Surely is a crime.

And no, she don't know what we do in our spare time.
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning.

Sun is out while I'm walkin' home,
And my head's up in the clouds.
Trying to get myself to bed
But I really don't know how.

And no, she don't know what I do in my spare time.
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning.

When I get myself home to my bedroom,
I'm gonna sleep all day 'til the sun sets.
<i>[x4]</i>

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning.
