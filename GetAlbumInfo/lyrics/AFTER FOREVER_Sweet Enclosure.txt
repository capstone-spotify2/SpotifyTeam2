Deep in these eyes where I'll drown
As a willing victim
Lost in those eyes, time passes by as I am drifting off!!

It took my mind
Its guide I'll follow
Surrendered to its will
I took it all
Embraced the beauty
Its sweet enclosure

Deep in its desire
Its cupidity, its thirst
To master the cureless
Lost in its way to devour all it can while I am giving in!

It took my mind
Its guide I'll follow
Surrendered to its will
I took it all
Embraced the beauty
Its sweet enclosure

Timeless, ancient, deep inside us as we
are empty without it, lost
Its sweet enclosure

Deep in its might
In its energy I'll dwell
A moving sensation
Lost in its arms
Timeless I will roam while I am breaking loose!

It took my mind
Its guide I'll follow
Surrendered to its will
I took it all
Embraced the beauty
Its sweet enclosure
