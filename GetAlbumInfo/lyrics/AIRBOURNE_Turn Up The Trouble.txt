I turn up the trouble 'till it gets real loud
I feel so much better that way
I'm gonna mess with your mind, cause I know that I can
See how much I can mess with you, yeaaaaaah! 

I'm gonna rock, gonna roll, gonna go toe to toe
Drop like a clock, now I'm out of control
Step a little closer, close to my fire
Trouble's my drug, takes me higher and higher
Turn up the music, light up the crowd
Turn up the gas, cause it can't be too loud
You know it's religion, and I'll show you the way
Drop to your knees and join when I say... 

What were you thinkin', takin' me on
Better men have fallen before
History teaches and I wrote the book... 
Well I'll show your ego the door, yeah! 

I'm gonna rock, gonna roll, gonna go toe to toe
Drop like a clock, now I'm out of control
Step a little closer, close to my fire
Trouble's my drug, takes me higher and higher
Turn up the music, light up the crowd
Turn up the gas, cause it can't be too loud
You know it's religion, and I'll show you the way
Drop to your knees and join when I say... 

I'm gonna mess with your man
Cause you know that I'm trouble
Step a little closer
Close to that fire
Troubles my drug
Takes me higher and higher
Turn up the music, light up the crowd
Turn up the gas, cause it can't be too loud

Gonna rock, gonna roll...
You know it's religion, and I'll show you the way
Drop to your knees and join when I say...
