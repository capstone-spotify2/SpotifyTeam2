I can't understand the way you feel
Well, in my heart, baby, I'm for real
It's just the way I am as you can see
But is this love between you and me?

It's all because of you
I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
'Cause I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Just because, oh baby, just because
I love you, you know I do

People like to talk, good and bad
In my heart, I know it makes me sad
I can't understand the little mistake
I'm not <i>[?]</i> just to give and take

It's all because of you
I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Just be, oh, it's just because, baby
Just because, just because
I love you, know I do

I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
Baby, it's just because
I have to cry, it's  just because I love you
Tell the world I do

I'm trying to be one man
It's all because I love you
Tell the world I do
Let me say one thing

I keep hangin' on
Just keep hangin' on
I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Deep down in my heart
I say I love you
Tell the world I do

There's just one more thing
I gotta be
