Nightly you retrace your steps again to return to the scene of the crime
It's uncanny how you hover in the air over the wreckage that you left behind

I want you but you're a poltergeist
I want you but, baby, the price is high
I want you and now I've said it twice so Mary dim the lights

Really, when you come into the room it's not helping me, seeing you now
It's not easy, in this phosphorescent gloom, telling waking dreams apart anyhow

I want you but you're a poltergeist
I want you but, baby, the price is high
I want you and now I've said it twice so Mary dim the lights

Cups and saucers crashing in but Houdini blows the gag again 
Then no one's a true believer

I want you but you're a poltergeist
I want you but, baby, the price is high
I want you and now I've said it twice so Mary dim the lights

Cups and saucers crashing in but Houdini blows the gag again
