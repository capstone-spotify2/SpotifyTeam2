You always had the blondest hair.
Chlorine stripped your skin pigment.
The cash was worth the fucking change.
At the pool from open to close.
Rake the bottom for loose change.
A job that paid for the luxury.
(The image still hurts my eyes)
But it probably lead to his divorce.
(White chlorine burns so bright)
It's probably the reason why his son hates him
(Sometimes I fear the night. When addiction became surprise)
Now your blood is so toxic
So toxic with chlorine that you only have 3 months left to live.

(Red stained eyes. Red stained eyes)
Was the, the change worth it?
(Red!)
Was the
(Stained!)
Divorce
(Eyes!)
Worth it?
(Red!)
Now you will
(Stained!)
Never
(Eyes!)
See your son again
(RED!)
Red!
