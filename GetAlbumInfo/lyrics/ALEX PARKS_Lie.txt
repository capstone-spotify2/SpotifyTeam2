If there was only light
If there was only dark
Would you see it?
Would you believe it?

If there was only time
If there was only love
Would you notice?
Would you lie to learn?

Your lie was true, you knew that you 
Could only go down
You lied to me like someone 
I didn't know

Hide your way
Lie, you say it for say it for  you and I
You and I

If there was only me
If there was only you
Could it fool you?
Would you see right through?

If there was only time
Only your life
Would you care so much?
Would you lie to learn?

Your lie was true, you knew that you 
Could only go down
You lied to me like someone 
I didn't know

Hide your way
Lie, you say it for say it for you and I
You and I
Hide your way
Lie, you say it for say it for you and I
You and I

If you could only love...
