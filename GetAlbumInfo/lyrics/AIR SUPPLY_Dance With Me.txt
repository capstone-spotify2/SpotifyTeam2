Dance with me let me put my arms around you
Step into the sound, close your eyes, you will see
Dance with me, I don't have an explanation
I only want to feel part of you next to me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I've thought about it for so long, that it could never be
I run away from every song, and wait until the final one
If you would only dance with me

Let me pull your body closer
Read your lips, speak your mind when you say
Dance with me, don't wait until the music's over
I don't want to watch as the night slips away

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Dance with me, let me put my arms around you

I'm standing here and I confess, the way you look inside that dress
Is bringing life onto this wooden floor
For one last time the band will play and I am only steps away
From feeling like I've never felt before

Dance with me, let me pull your body closer
Let me read your lips speak your mind when you say
Dance with me; don't wait until the music's over
I don't want to watch as the night slips away

<i>[Chorus]</i>
