Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time

Love is a quote
Fame over friends
And what's the point of trying
If everything's a trend
The only thing that lasts is the ink on your skin
What happened to being different we only follow what's in

I try and tell myself it's all in my head
But why think twice if I'm already dead

Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time

Mind over matter over thinking is dangerous
Images will shatter what people think of us
I have my doubts but what the fuck is right
I'm staring down a tunnel expecting a light

I try and tell myself its all in my head
But why think twice if I'm already dead

Burn this bitch down
Fuck this bitch up
Tear the walls
Burn this bitch down

Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time
