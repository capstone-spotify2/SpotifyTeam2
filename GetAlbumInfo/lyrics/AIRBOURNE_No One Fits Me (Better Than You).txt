You caught my eye in that leather and lace
We hitched a ride straight to your place
You killed the lights and the room went black
You threw me down, took the skin right off my back

But that's ok I love the pain coz

No one fits me better than you
No one fits me better than you
No one fits like the way that you do
No one fits me (fits me) better than you

We've come and gone then we do it again
All night long round and round the bed
We got the rhythm and the groove is tight
You chew me up spit me out and take another bite

That's ok I love the pain coz

No one fits me better than you
No one fits me better than you
No one fits like the way that you do
No one fits me (fits me) better than you

I'm runnin' dry, I'm outta breath
You satisfy every inch you get
You are the best woman I've ever had

No one fits me better than you
I said no one fits me better than you
No one fits like the way that you do
No one fits me (fits me) better than

No one fits me better than you
No one fits me better than you
No one fits like the way that you do
No one fits me (fits me) better than you

We're not done, not yet
Morning comes and we're comin' again
Like a freight train goin' off the tracks
With your long sharp nails
Still hangin' of my back

I say no one fits me
No one fits me
No one comes close
No one else will do
No one fits me (fits me) better than you
