Oh I was perfect for the circus
If he dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I'd give it up, but I guess it was not enough
Cause he never seemed satisfied

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day, who is?
He wanted someone this perfect
Well okay, but can you tell me who is?

He set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But I still kept on reaching
He watched me try at least a thousand times
If he loved me, he'd stop me, but no

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I saw my future in his eyes
So wrong, so wrong
Guess I was destined for ruining my life
Cause he didn't break me down, he made me strong

<i>[Chorus]</i>
