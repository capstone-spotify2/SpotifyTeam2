Hello
It's good to see you coming back again
It's been a long time
Since I sat with you, my friend

I'll lend an ear
It's not that so severe
Time has killed the pain
And dried up every tear

And now
I'm thinking bout what went, down
All the heartache
I laughed away
Just like a clown

And now
Sit around talking
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
Spend some time
You sit around talking
Thinking bout the past
It's funny how it lingers
But nothings meant to last

And my Ma
She'd like to say hello
But shes a little scared
That I can't let it go
So let on, ease back, brother
And let it slip away
I'm tired of hanging onto
The pains of yesterday

Once again
The money is so thick
It makes your heart go numb
It makes your mind get sick

So come on by
Stay and talk about it
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in, brother of mine
We'll sit around talking
Drink some wine
And maybe by the morning everything is fine
Everything is fine
Ease back, brother
Let this clear your mind

Come on by
And drink yourself a good time
Have some wine
And think about each other
Sister and I are fine
Yes, I've been alright now
Take it lightly
Step on out the front door
I'll see you in some time
