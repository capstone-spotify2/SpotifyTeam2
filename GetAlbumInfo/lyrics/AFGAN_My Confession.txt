Your smile brings light into my days
The thoughts of you, warm my night
To hold you in my arms, 
Even in my dreams it feels so right
Loving you... 

You never see the way I look into your
Eyes
You never realize the love I feel
Inside
Pain and sorrow that haunted me, 
Cause words are left unsaid

Now you've found someone else to love
Deep in my heart, love won't fade away
To hold you in my arms
Even in my dreams it feels so right loving you

You never see the way I look into your
Eyes
You never realize the love I feel
Inside
Pain and sorrow that haunted me, 
Cause words are left unsaid

You never see the way I look into your
Eyes
You never realize the love I feel
Inside
Pain and sorrow that haunted me, 
Cause words are left unsaid to you...
