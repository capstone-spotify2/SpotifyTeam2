My innocence
How it always seem to get lost
In violence
We always seem to get caught
It's no coincidence
That we're running from the past
Forgiveness wasn't something that we have

Limitless
We're living limitless
I refuse to just exist
I rather shoot and miss
So I'mma raise my fist
And live it limitless
Limitless

Limitless
I refuse to just exist
I rather shoot and miss
So I'mma raise my fist
And live it limitless
Limitless

Limitless
Limitless
Limitless

Renegade
See the world through open eyes
We ricochet
Across the dark blue skies
While masquerade
Is for the ones who want to hide
I won't stay in the shadows all my life

Limitless
We're living limitless
I refuse to just exist
I rather shoot and miss
So I'mma raise my fist
And live it limitless
Limitless

Limitless
I refuse to just exist
I rather shoot and miss
So I'mma raise my fist
And live it limitless
Limitless
