Do you really wanna know me, do you care what's inside
Can you ever really show me there's no secrets I must hide
If I bare my soul, can you accept it all
My darkest corner's safe behind a wall
Do you really wanna know me at all
I can't accept the pain, my brain screams like a runaway train
Trying to keep my heart on track
The embers turned to flame and I want you back
But I can't trust a memory, can't trust a memory
Oh, I can't trust me
Do you really wanna know me, do you know what makes me smile
Can you ever really promise me this time it's not a lie
I'll believe it's true when you're standin' at my door
I'm always here for you and I'll open it once more
Do you really wanna know me
Do you really wanna know me
Do you really wanna know me at all
