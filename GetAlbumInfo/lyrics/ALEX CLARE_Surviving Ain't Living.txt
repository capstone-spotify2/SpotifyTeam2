Stuck in a row, you can't get out
There's too much causing you down
No catch, no time, no self-esteem
They're out taking, and not giving

Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Living
Feels like
Falling
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Just surviving ain't
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Feels like
Falling
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Just surviving ain't

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

They may wreck your dreams if you let them
Keep the goal inside, don't forget them
Keep your head up high 'cause the future's bright
Keep your head up high

Stuck in a row, you can't get out
There's too much causing you down
No catch, no time, no self-esteem
They're out taking, and not giving

Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't living
Just surviving ain't
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Living
Feels like
Falling
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Just surviving ain't
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Feels like
Falling
Feels like
(Oh oh oh oh)
Just surviving ain't

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

Just surviving ain't
