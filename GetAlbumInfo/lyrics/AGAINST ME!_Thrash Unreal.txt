If she wants to dance and drink all night, well thereâs no one that can stop her. 
Sheâs going until the house lights come up or her stomach spills onto the floor. 
This night is gonna end when weâre damn well ready for it to be over. 
Worked all week long now the music is playing on our time. 
We do what we do to get by, and then we need a release.

You get mixed up with the wrong guys. 
You get messed up on the wrong drugs. 
Sometimes the party takes you places that you didnât really plan on going. 
When people see the track marks on her arms she knows what theyâre thinking. 
She keeps on working for that minimum,

They donât know nothing about redemption. 
They donât know nothing about recovery.

Sheâs out of step with the style. 
She donât know where the actions happening. 
You know the downtown club scene ain't nothing like it used to be. 
You reach a point where thereâs not a lie in the world 
that you could use to make the boys believe you're still in you twenties. 
But they keep getting younger, don't they baby?
Sheâs not waiting for someone to come over and ask for the privilege. 
She can still hear that Rebel Yell just as loud as it was in 1983, you know.  
There ain't no Johnny coming home to share a bed with her and she doesnât care.

No mother ever dreams that her daughters going to grow up to be a junkie.
No mother ever dreams that her daughters going to grow up to sleep alone.

No mother ever dreams that her daughters going to grow up to be a junkie.
And if she had to live it all over again you know she wouldnât change anything for the world.
