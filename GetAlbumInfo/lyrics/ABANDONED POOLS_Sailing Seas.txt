Damn this destiny
And damn this twist of fate
And damn its 5 A.M.
and I'm still awake
You're haunting me
I know it's hypocrisy
but this is not easy
And this is not what we were supposed to be

So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore

To hell with irony
To hell with subtlety
'Cause I don't have time
To mince words anymore
I was there
I'm crouched down in the hall
My ear up to the wall
I can hear you
forgetting about me

So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore

Holly
Wasn't very easy
When he took you from me
And I can't listen to that CD anymore
Since you walked out my door

Was it certain death
When he took off your dress
When he finished your cigarettes

So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore

Holly
Wasn't very easy
When he took you from me
I can't listen to that CD anymore
