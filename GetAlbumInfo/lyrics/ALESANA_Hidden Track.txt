Dear love, I'm honestly scared.
Your voice is everywhere.
Are you there?
Oh, I am not ready for this.
There's so much about you, love, I miss.
Do you know that I'm lost?
And you left me here on my own.
Songs live on but I'm dancing alone.
Where is my lullaby?
Sometimes I forget you're gone.
You're all I have, known for so long.
Do you know that I'm lost?
And you left me here on my own.
Songs live on but I'm dancing alone.
Where is my lullaby?
(Two bits of singing together...)
Do you know that I'm lost?
And you left me here on my own.
Songs live on but I'm dancing alone.
My hand is lost without yours to hold in mine.
And tonight I will say goodbye.
