<i>[Mark:]</i> Sunday football I got boot off the pitch 
Some people gamble as a way to get rich 
I gotta find a better way to invest in zeroes, oh 

<i>[Mark:]</i> They say that rents may damage your health 
I'd rather save it all to spend on myself 
I got a letter of eviction and I'm no hero 

<i>[All:]</i> Oh, oh, oh, oh 
<i>[Ben:]</i> I'm not a saver I'm a spender (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) 
I'm a one weekender 

<i>[All:]</i> What can we do when our 2 worlds colide? 
<i>[Paul:]</i> There's only 10 ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
<i>[All:]</i> After a hard day of work I go home 
I dunno where I'm going, but I'm ready to go 
I made a lotta money, but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home 

<i>[Chris:]</i> I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of life 
Plenty of butter but I don't have a knife 
Sure beats the hell outta waiting for a ticket to Rino 

<i>[Chris:]</i> Watching TV makes me really upset 
I wonder why I havent been on it yet 
I'm silly waiting for a part in a Tarrantino 

<i>[Ben:]</i> (Oh, oh, oh, oh) No, no, no, no 
I'm not a saver I'm a spender (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) 
I'm a 1 weekender 

<i>[All:]</i> What can we do when our 2 worlds colide? 
<i>[Paul:]</i> There's only 10 ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
<i>[All:]</i> After a hard day of work I go home 
Y'know, I dunno where I'm going, but I'm ready to go 
I made a lotta money, but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home 
<i>[Paul:]</i> Yeah, yeah, I said I wanna go home 

<i>[All:]</i> What can we do when our 2 world colide? Oh... 

<i>[All:]</i> After a hard day of work I go home 
I dunno where I'm going, but I'm ready to go 
<i>[Paul:]</i> I said I 
<i>[All:]</i> Made a lotta money, but got nothing to show 
<i>[Paul:]</i> And now it's 
<i>[All:]</i> 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home 
<i>[Paul:]</i> Yeah, I'm waiting for the train to go home
