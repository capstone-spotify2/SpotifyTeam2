If your happy and you know it clap your hands
(Clap, clap)
If your happy and you know it clap your hands
(Clap, clap)

If your happy and you know it
Surely want to show it, clap your hands
(Clap, clap)

If your happy and you know it stomp your feet
(Stomp, stomp)
If your happy and you know it stomp your feet
(Stomp, stomp)

If your happy and you know it
And you surely want to show it stomp your feet
(Stomp, stomp)

If your happy and you know it shout hurray
Hurray
If your happy and you know it shout hurray
Hurray

If your happy and you know it
And you surely want to show it shout hurray
Hurray

If your happy and you know it do all three
(Clap, clap, stomp, stomp, hurray)
