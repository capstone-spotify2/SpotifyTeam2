I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells
I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells

Do you hear what I hear
Your lips are kissing mine
Can you hear the bells darling
Can you hear them when I'm kissing you

What do I have to do to make you feel the tingling too

Can you hear the bells darling
Can you hear them when I'm kissing you

Oh yeah
Oh, I hear the bells, ringing in my ear
Tell me do you love me, do you love me, do you love me, do you love me like I love you

Oh, it's one thing that I want you to remember
If you ever leave me I believe I'll go insane
And I'll never hear the bells again
No, I'll never hear the bells again
No, I'll never hear the bells again
