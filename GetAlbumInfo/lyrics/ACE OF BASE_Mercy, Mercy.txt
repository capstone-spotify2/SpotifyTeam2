The man in the moon has a thousand different faces
The man in the mood changes colors each day
He's watching us all, the big and the small
(Oh can he see) Just you and me
Searching for my destiny

Mercy, Mercy
You've got to have pity on me
Have mercy on me 
Mercy, Mercy
Wanna be free and happy
Have mercy on me 

Do you believe we can travel to the future 
Do you believe there's a man in the sky 
We're making him sad, the good and the bad 
(Oh can he see) Just you and me 
Searching for my Destiny 

Mercy, Mercy 
You've got to have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 
Mercy, Mercy 
Wanna be free and happy 
Have mercy on me 

I don't wanna be just one of many faces 
I want you looking at me 
Sit down and take a look, put me into motion 
Give me something to believe 

Mercy, Mercy 
You've got to have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 

Mercy, Mercy 
You've got to have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 

Mercy, Mercy 
You've got to have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 

Mercy, Mercy 
You've got to have pity on me 
Have mercy on me
