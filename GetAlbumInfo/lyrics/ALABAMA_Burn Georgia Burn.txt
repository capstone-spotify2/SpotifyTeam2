Atlanta was on fire, so was she the night he left her
He left her there to bare her pain alone
Hoping to return
Burn, Georgia burn.

Roaring of the guns feel the emptiness inside her
Where once she felt the pounding of her heart
When he held her in his arms the tenderness they learned
Burn, Georgia burn.

He was a body, she was the soul
Of the love affair they couldn't control
While their world was falling down around them
They were not concerned
Burn, Georgia burn.

Winter brought the snow, and the rider down from Franklin
With news about the war had taken a toll
And he would not return
Burn, Georgia burn.

He was a body, she was the soul
Of the love affair they couldn't control
While their world was falling down around them
They were not concerned
Burn, Georgia burn.

While strolling through her mind
She stumbled on an old familier feeling
Of how he touched her many years ago
And how he made her burn
Burn, Georgia burn...
