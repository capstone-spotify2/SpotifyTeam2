<i>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i>
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, and a pebble hour bitch stand the rain

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned 5
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Counter-tops, we hop over, hit the register then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
I told niggas, caught wrecked, and then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliche to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make em' pay double
Anxious when I'm banking on the table I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' LA, now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward dog, I'm trynna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis

<i>[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]</i>
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit I'm actin

Suckin' on titties since I was 8
Hoodie with my shades I ain't trynna be fake
So don't be talking to me pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than if you fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin'
You hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'

<i>[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]</i>
Perpetratin', bitches poppin' percocet and percolatin'
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, gettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from

<i>[Verse 5: Jay Rock]</i>
All we do is do it, shittin' on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with' a uzi
Peel off in a dooney, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, and poke on some coochie
I'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head -
I'm Jay Rock, you norm' niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil, with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin' you sweet but you weak
Talkin out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember my nigga, I'm not goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit' proof, recruit a hunnit' troops who love to shoot
No fluke my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt city mayhem
Choppers that sprayin' from AM to PM
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin' a 50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe tagging wack rappers off GP
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi
In the backwood lightin', we high for like 3 weeks
You payin' for that pussy but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg Conglomerate, HiiiPower, bitch
