Below these leaves
and below the dirt
There's a path that leads
to the center of this Earth, I swear
If you're lucky
you'll make it through
Deep inside, there's a chamber for me and you
Only for you and me
I see it all, in your ancient eye
I see it all, in your ancient eye
I see it all, in your ancient eye
I see it all, in your ancient eye
