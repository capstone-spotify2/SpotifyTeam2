I got a wild thing for you
Were talking hoops you got me jumping through
You got those lemon drop martini eyes
And if my karma suits youd cross the line into another place &amp; time

Tell me how pretty she is when she turns the colors of the rainbow
One more day with you Trip Hoppin
one more night with you no stoppin
aint no smoking fantasy cause love you is trippin to me

you got me cycled in size? you got my situation bonified
it took a sunset to get me to see
that i all really needed was your love to yeah forever shine on me
you promised promised you &amp; me is like waiting for your ectasy

one more night with you no stoppin

in my kaliediscope i'm looking thru my only color was a neon blue
i was hanging on to yesterday and now the only way i get thru
i'll be on my rainbow is my laying down your end of pillow

one more day with you trip hoppin
one more night with you no stoppin
aint no smoking fantasy cause love you is trippin to me
one more day with you trip hoppin
one more night with you no stoppin
