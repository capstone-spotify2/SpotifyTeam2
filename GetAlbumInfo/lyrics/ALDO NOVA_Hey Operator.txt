I paid my money, dialed my numbers
I got the operator on the line
I wanna dial long-distance
That little girl of mine

She said that I could call her
Any time of day
I just dial the numbers
And she'll be on her way

Well, I said, "Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me
Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me"

Well, don't you rush me
Don't you leave the floor
And don't you tell me
That she went out the door

Well, talk and talk and talk
Is all you ever do
I paid my money
I want some results from you

Then I said, "Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me
Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me"

'Cause I'm a dirty white boy
And I'm in love with her
So don't you rush me
Don't you rush me, operator

I said, "Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me
Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me"

Well, I said, "Hey, operator
I'm a dirty white boy
And I'm in love with her
So don't you rush me
Don't you trust me, operator?"

I said, "Hey, operator"
Operator
Hey operator
Operator
Hey operator
Operator
Hey operator
Operator
Hey operator
