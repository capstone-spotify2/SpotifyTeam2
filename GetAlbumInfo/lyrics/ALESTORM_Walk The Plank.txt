The time for execution, a harrowing display
For treachery upon the seas has taken place this day
Your final hour has begun,
We've all agreed your end has come
We'll take your sword, we'll take your gun - it's time
For you to come undone
Be aware, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and pointy teeth
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
A nameless bay, in the mist
You have no right to exist
You've got the captain really pissed,
and so it's time you were dismissed
Give the line a little twist
And wrap the ropes around your wrist
Eyes to fill your soul with dread
The fury of the hammerhead
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
Be aware my friend, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and full of pointy teeth
Burning eyes to fill your soul right up with dread
The raging fury of the hammerhead
