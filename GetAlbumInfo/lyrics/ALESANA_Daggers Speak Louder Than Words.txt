Eyes open to splattered blood
Cold tile mocks me as I arise to find the knife is still in my back
Shifting thoughts now slow with venom
Take me as I stagger
Is this all we were worth?
I've lost you for good without regret
Your once gentle words are bleeding from my eyes
Screams of terror now fill my every breath
I know you'll rue the day you ever met me
I'll lay you down to sleep
When sorrow will bury the blade hilt deep

You know I would have died for you
Now I'm forced to choose between
A life of revenge or regret
As I thirst for vengeance
My heart struggles to come to grips
Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away?

Alone,
You stood so still as you watched me break
Did it now kill you too?
What has led you to the dagger my friend?

You know I would have died for you
Now I'm forced to choose between
A life of revenge or regret
As I thirst for vengeance
My heart struggles to come to grips
Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away?
Turn, and walk away
Turn, and walk away

My revenge is made so clear
Midst cold tears left with the betrayed
I'll see that you never forget this
I will hunt you down like a dog
Lies could never disguise
What I saw behind me in you

Remembering times
We have shared
My friend for life is gone
Remembering times
(We'll let the embers serve as the only memory of last days...)
We have shared
My friend for life is gone
(...so long ago)

Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away?
Why would you leave me to die after you had buried the dagger hilt deep?

You're dead to me
I would have died for you
Now I'm forced to choose between
A life of revenge or regret
As I thirst for vengeance
My heart struggles to come to grips
Why would you leave me to die?
You're dead to me
