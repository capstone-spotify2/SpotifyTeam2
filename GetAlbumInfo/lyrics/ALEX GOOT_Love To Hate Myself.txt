Iâm going crazy,
Thinking about the things that I should have done while
I was a slightly younger man
I know I made mistakes

I wasted my time
Thinking I was doing good
Things with my life
Jumping through the hoops
And not thinking on my own

I just love hating my own life sometimes
I tend to criticize myself
Itâs hard to feel like Iâve done well sometimes
I just love to hate myself

If all else fails me
I could always try to quit while Iâm ahead
I canât quit while Iâm behind,
Whoa, that doesnât make any sense

I just love hating my own life sometimes
I tend to criticize myself
Itâs hard to feel like Iâve done well sometimes
I just love to hate myself

Full of self-doubt, and full self-regret,
Stumble to my feet today
Full of lonely, my creations
Iâll make one good enough someday

Iâm going crazy,
Thinking about the things
That I would have to do now
As Iâm I move on with my life
And make some new mistakes
Make some new mistakes
Oh yeah

I just love hating my own life sometimes
I tend to criticize myself
Itâs hard to feel like Iâve done well sometimes
I just love to hate myself
