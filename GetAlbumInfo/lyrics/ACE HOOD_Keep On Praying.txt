I just keep on praying
I just keep on praying
I just hope that when I speak you listen
Know you people like to understand man
I'm a keep on praying
I just keep on praying
Never know if it'll ever happen
Gotta keep my faith into the man

I just keep on praying
Gotta keep on praying
Praying over my friends
Pray washing my sins
I just really wanna win
Praying then I get the Benz
Keep them blessings coming in
Keep them blessings coming in lord

I'm losing too many friends
We losing too many kids
Praying for benefits, murder the innocent
Really, we don't understand
Has to be real to my fans
I got the blood on my hands
I feel the pain of the mother
Who never gon' see them again
She'll never forget or forgive
She loaded in permanent tears
Wake up, get yourself something
Mama been saying it for years
Tough times, get your mind right
Hard heads make it sound fast
Hustle hard and get the brown bags
Keep the tool where my dawg said
Only surrounded by reals
I get word on my children
Know when they a perfect building
Passion is still on the million
Lord knows I go through up and downs
I'm just really trying to get it now
I've been stressing for a minute now
Whole lot for me to think about

But I just keep on praying
I just keep on praying
I just hope that when I speak you listen
Know you people like to understand man
I'm a keep on praying
I just keep on praying
Never know if it'll ever happen
Gotta keep my faith into the man

I just keep on praying
Gotta keep on praying
Praying over my friends
Pray washing my sins
I just really wanna win
Praying then I get the Benz
Keep them blessings coming in
Keep them blessings coming in lord

I feel they don't understand me
I know the struggle prepare me
I miss the smile of my granny
I miss the smile of my granny
I hope I'm making you proud
Keep me some angels around
I want my people that down
Devils are never allowed
Pray for my mind and my souls
Cover me out on the road
Why the world so cold?
Farewell, so long
Another one murdered in cold blood
Running the streets with the wrong ones
Turned out it's one of his homeboys
No love, no love, yeah
Consequences, repercussions
Mama crying, preacher coming
Rainy days, long nights
Hope those lessons taught you something
God is good, God is great
He ain't making no mistakes
Before I lay, I gotta pray
Knowing he gon' make a way

But I just keep on praying
I just keep on praying
I just hope that when I speak you listen
Know you people like to understand man
I'm a keep on praying
I just keep on praying
Never know if it'll ever happen
Gotta keep my faith into the man

I just keep on praying
Gotta keep on praying
Praying over my friends
Pray washing my sins
I just really wanna win
Praying then I get the Benz
Keep them blessings coming in
Keep them blessings coming in lord

Keep them blessings coming in lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord
Keep them blessings coming in lord
Keep them blessings coming in
Keep them blessings coming in
Keep them blessings coming in

Oh, I just keep on praying
I just keep on praying
I just hope that when I speak you listen
Know you people like to understand man

I'm a keep on praying
I just keep on praying
Never know if it'll ever happen
Gotta keep my faith into the man

I just keep on...
