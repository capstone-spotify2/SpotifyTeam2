Girl I know you've been deceived 
that your heart has been mistreated 
He took your dreams and turned them to stone (yeah) 
Hate to see you so upset but hey girl don't you forget 
that I'm here for you, you are not on your own 

And you can always count on me and the reason 
is you see 
I'm never gonna lie, never wanna see you cry - oh 
sometimes 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Everybody knows everybody's soul to soul 
Everybody knows this sound 
Crashing to the floor you said 
Pick the pieces up again 
I won't let you down 

Don't you keep busy distressing 
The fun that you'll be missing 
is out there it's all waiting for you 
There's a dream with your name on it 
so put it in your pocket 
Jump right to the front of the queue 

And you can always count on me and then the reason 
is you see 
I'm never gonna lie, never wanna see you cry - oh 
sometimes 

<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i>

Stop the tears you cry 
I am here for you 
When waters running dry 
I'll be there for you 
Time after time - there's nothing I won't do 
It's the sound, it's the sound of my love for you 

<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i>
