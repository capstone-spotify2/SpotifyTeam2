The air was soft and smelled of rain
So out of breath I found you waiting 
You bounded through me like a train
One word and I was captivated
Your spark wholehearted
Drifting close and then apart
I think of you each time I felt like feeling confused
This pace requires
Every breath to keep the fire at bay
Or I will find myself entangled up in you

Take my hand move softly
Lead the way don't let me go
For I am on a journey
With you exploring tomorrow

You like surprises you like dares
So close you cannot see you're charming
I tell you I'll always be there
Hoping you'll stay until the morning
Where we are going
We're not sure that we don't know
But all the possibilities feel full of promise
You might reject me
If you do I'll feel defective
I won't tell you every moment makes me feel alive

Take my hand move softly
Lead the way don't let me go
For I am on a journey
With you exploring tomorrow

With every word you play
With every word I say
I stack my mind with so much fear
It's easier to run
But then we would be done
All our potential stranded here

Take my hand move softly
Lead the way don't let me go
For I am on a journey
With you exploring tomorrow

I lived on complicated days
But found my love was unrewarding
Now i would think it worth the wait 
If our tomorrow comes a-calling
