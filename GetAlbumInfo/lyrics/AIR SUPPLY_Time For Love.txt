I came to try
To tell you that I gotta let you go
Now I'm wondering why
God knows I don't even know
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
I don't care if it's wrong or right
This feeling inside of me
Is more than some fantasy
It's bigger than you and me
It must be time for love

I've spoken my mind
There's nothing left for me to say
Well it's black and white
There's nothing standing in your way
Stay the night here and see
Share your body with me
And I'll show you two hearts on fire
Your reaching out with your eyes
Got me so hypnotized
Now that you realize
It must be time for love

Hold me with all your might
Take me on thru the night
You make everything just right
It must be time for love

Only your heart will know when it's time for love

Don't wait too long or you'll find you're
All alone and love has come and gone

This feeling inside of me
Is more than some fantasy
It's bigger than you and me
It must be time for love

Hold me with all your might
Take me on thru the night
You make everything just right
It must be time for love
