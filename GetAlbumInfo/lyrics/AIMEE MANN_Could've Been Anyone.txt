It's so hard not to blame you
It's hard not to put all the blame on you
Cause you knew from the start
There was one little part you would not let through

I'm sure there were even moments when you thought
You might someday finish what you'd begun
But that could've been anyone
Could've been anyone

I lost my place in the sun
Well, never mind
It could've been anyone

So we all make mistakes
It just figures you'd make me the biggest one
I was saving it up
Now it's spent and I don't know
What I spent it on

Now I find if you try hard enough
You can wear it down 'til it's just about gone

'Til you could've been anyone
You could've been anyone

You lost your place in the sun
Well, never mind
Could've been anyone

Your pattern is different 
From what it implies
The words may be true but
I realize
It isn't description so much as disguise

Don't worry, you can learn to live without
You've got a lifetime of that to draw upon
And anyway

It could've been anyone

You lost your place in the sun
Lost your place in the sun
Oh, you lost your place in the sun
Well, never mind
Never mind
It could've been anyone
Lost your place in the place
Never mind...
(Could've been anyone...)
(You lost you place in the sun)
(I think that's enough now)
(You lost you place in the sun)
