Heaven
(feels like heaven to me)
Heaven
(feels like heaven to me)
Get up in the morning and I see your smiling face
Feels like a dream
I'm wide awake
It's just too good to be true
That's what I'm thinking when I'm loving you
Lay down every evening and your by my side
Straight from above into my life
I pray the lord my love to keep
When we're together I'm in extasy

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Girl you take my breath away
And if there was one word to say
What it's like bein' with you
I guess the word heaven, would have to do
And heaven's where I wanna be
In heaven, there is love and peace
And you are all that I need, so plain to see
Just touchin' me, feels like heaven to me

Feels like heaven to me,
Feels like heaven to me
Feels like heaven to me
Feels like heaven to me

Baby, you're an angel,
And your love is so divine
Pure and supreme,
Gets better all the time
Your tender kiss, I can't resist
Never thought nothin' could feel like this

Maybe you could tell me somethin' that I wanna know
Like how d'you get so far from home
A little bit of paradise
That's what I'm seein' shinin' in your eyes

<i>[Chorus x1]</i>

I can't control the love I feel
(<i>[bg:]</i> I can't control the way I feel
Your love's the highest high)
It's the highest high
(<i>[bg:]</i> if I could ever change a thing
Don't think I'd even try)
Oh, don't think I would try
(<i>[bg:]</i> cause this is pure, it's love divine
And I know that this is real)
Cause I can see the change in me
By the way that you make me feel
Feels like heaven to me.
Feels like heaven to me.

<i>[Chorus x1]</i>

Take my breath away
There's just one word to say,
What it's like bein' with you
I guess the word heaven, would have to do
Heaven's where I wanna be
In heaven, there is love and peace
And you are all that I need, it's so plain to see
Just touchin' me, feels like heaven to me

Feels like heaven to me.
Feels like heaven to me...
