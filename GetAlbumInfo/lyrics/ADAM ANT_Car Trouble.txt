Have you ever had a ride in a light blue car?
Have you ever stopped to think who's the slave and who's the master?
Have you ever had trouble with your automobile?
Have you ever had to push push push push?
Cartrouble oh yeah

You might have seen them very busy at the weekends (oh oh)
Lick lick and polishing the beep-beeps into shape
And then its proudly up the M1 M2 M3
And keep your feet off the upholstery Ronnie
Cartrouble oh yeah

Car carcar trouble car carcar trouble
Car carcar trouble car carcar trouble
Car carcar trouble car carcar trouble
Car carcar trouble car carcar trouble

And remember this:
You don't need anything after an icecream

I used to sit at home silently and wonder
Why all the preference is polishing the chrome
While all the mothers and the sisters and the babies
Sit and rot at home
Cartrouble oh yeah

And remember this:
You don't need anything after an icecream

Car carcar trouble car carcar trouble
