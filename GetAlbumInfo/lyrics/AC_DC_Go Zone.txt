Want some relaxation need to get some r n r
That's rest and recreation
Don't need no vacation I don't have to go that far
I got better things to do with my money
Don't need no private eye forget the FBI
Cos when the beaver sing let me out I'm closin' in
To the go zone, ready to fly
In the go zone, standin' up high
In the go zone, down on the block
In the go zone, ready to rock
Down, down ,down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

Gotta have my candy gotta have my sugar sweet
I wanna give you a treat
Givin' you directions you don't have to use your feet
Were on the same street baby
You gotta travel south south of my hungry mouth
An' there you'll find a friend until the bitter end
To the go zone, ready to fly
In the go zone, standin' up high
In the go zone, down on the block
In the go zone, ready to rock
Down, down ,down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

What you gonna find down there
Ain't no red light to stop you

Get yourself a ticket
To the go zone, ready to fly
In the go zone, standin' up high
In the go zone, down on the block
In the go zone, ready to rock
In the go zone, ready to fly
In the go zone, standin' up high
In the go zone, down on the block
In the go zone, ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

In the go zone
