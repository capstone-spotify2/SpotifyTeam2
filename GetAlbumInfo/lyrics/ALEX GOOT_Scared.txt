I can tell from the way you walk
Youâve never seen the world
And youâve been a little girl for far too long
When you say those things to me
Youâre messing with my head
Did you mean it when you said Iâm not what youâre looking for?

So maybe I could make you need me
Maybe weâll just have to find out
Donât hate me for the way Iâm feeling
You know I know we know Iâm feeling
So scared
You know it

Youâll make me wait for it
Get on my knees and beg
Iâm forced to compromise with what you say
Make those words count make me see
I am wrong you were right

So maybe I could make you need me
Maybe weâll just have to find out
Donât hate me for the way Iâm feeling
You know I know we know Iâm feeling

From the distance you seem worlds away
Iâll never reach you
What happened to us anyway?
From across the world itâs hard to say
If I even miss you
But it sure feels like it today
It sure feels like it today
You made me say whatâs on my mind
Iâm regretting every single time
We talked things over or we made up
Iâve finally had enough

So maybe I could make you need me
Maybe weâll just have to find out
Donât hate me for the way Iâm feeling
You know I know we know Iâm feeling
