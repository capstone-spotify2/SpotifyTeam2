He's a no good lover
Baby I tried him out

He's handsome and he knows how to use it
And he doesn't take a no for an answer
Like a catcher in the rye he nags till you die
His flatter makes you fall
But don't expect to have a ball

He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na - na - na
He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na - na - na

On the beach you'll see him showing off badly
With a golden look he conquers your best friend
And she has to say yes to her new excess
Americas by far the most miserable man

He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na - na - na
He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na - na - na

He's a no good lover - na - na...
He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out

He's a no...
He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na- na - na
He's a no good lover
Baby I've tried him out
He's - na - na - na - na - na
