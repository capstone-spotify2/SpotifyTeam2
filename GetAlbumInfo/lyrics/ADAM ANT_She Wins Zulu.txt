Small change, good news, she wins Zulus

Small change, good news, she wins Zulus
Small change, good news, she wins Zulus

Life is like a pantomime
Where boys and girls all sing in time
She wished, she wished that she could dance
Like Michael Jackson, NO chance!

She's 18 and it's very late
She's worried she won't get a date
A panic in the lingerie
And who can help her? NOT me!

Small change, good news, she wins Zulus
Small change, good news, she wins Zulus

She's 18 and it's very late
She's worried she won't get a date
A panic in the lingerie,
And who can help her? NOT me

The kid at school in large amounts
Said she knew basey for it could count
That's my little joke she said and smiled
I got my bubbles but this cat's wild

Small change, good news, she wins Zulus
Small change, good news, she wins Zulus

Small change, (She likes Johnny) good news (she likes Joe)
She wins Zulus (but they both ignore her so)
Small change (She likes Johnny) good news (she likes Joe)
She wins Zulus (but they both ignore her so)

Small change, good news, she wins Zulus
