(The day I fell in love)
The day I fell in love with you
(Was a day that I knew)
The day I knew my life began
(The day that I break up)
The day that I break up with you
(Will be the day that I know)
Will be the day I know my life will end

You and I belong together
It gets hard, but yes it gets better
I know I'm not gon' give up on you
So don't you dare give up on me
Girl, at least tell me

I know that this ain't how our story ends
This ain't how it ends, no
I know that we're not runnin' out of love
We're not runnin' out of love
And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
'Cause baby we ain't even close to done

(I hear the whispers)
I hear the whispers from your friends
(They say we ain't got no)
They say we ain't got no chance
(They say that you need to)
They say you need to leave your man
(Ain't no way)
Well, ain't no way that's happening

Uuh, you and I belong together
It gets hard, but yes it gets better
I know I'm not gon' give up on you
So don't you dare give up on me
Girl, at least tell me

I know that this ain't how our story ends
This ain't how it ends, no
I know that we're not runnin' out of love
We're not runnin' out of love
And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
'Cause baby we ain't even close to done

Even if it takes all of our eternity
(If it takes eternity)
I know in the end you're supposed to be for me
(You'll be right here with me)

Hear me now, ain't no doubt
Promise you that we're not out
I'm not gon' give up on you
So don't you dare give up on me, girl

I know that this ain't how our story ends
This ain't how it ends, no
I know that we're not runnin' out of love
We're not runnin' out of love
And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
'Cause baby we ain't even close to done

I know that this ain't how our story ends
This ain't how it ends, no
I know that we're not runnin' out of love
We're not runnin' out of love
And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
'Cause baby we ain't even close to done
