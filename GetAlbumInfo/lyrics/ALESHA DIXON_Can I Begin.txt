As much as I've been trying to say
As much as I appear OK
I'm holding on
Pretending nothing is wrong
There's many things I wanna see
But first of all I gotta see me
Cause I can't breathe

Now that we're over
Lifes getting colder
Trying so hard to feel the sun

Can I begin to re-live my life?
Release all the pain inside
Over done now
Wanna love again

Every day is a different vibe
Up and down like a fairground ride
Over done now

How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
I'm not trying win
Oh oh oh
How can I begin?
To love again

Situated in my bed
Pictures running through my head
Some are good
Some wish I never took no no
The probability of me
Feeling down and lonely
I'm no longer scared

Now that we're over
Life is getting colder
Trying so hard to feel the sun

Can I begin to re-live my life?
Release all the pain inside
I wanna love again
Over done now

Every day is a different vibe
Up and down like a fairground ride
Over done now

How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
I'm not trying win
Oh oh oh
How can I begin
To love again?

Hold on
When all the hope is gone
I'm starting at the ending
And I'll just move on

Fall down
Still wearing my crown
Nothing's gonna hurt me
Cause what goes around comes around
Yeah oh oh oh oh
What goes around comes around

Baby can I begin to re-live my life?
And release all the pain inside
Over done now

How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
How can I begin?
Oh oh oh
I'm not trying to win
Oh oh oh
How can I begin?
To love again
