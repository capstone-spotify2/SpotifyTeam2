Lie in comfort of sweet calamity with nothing left to lose.
Lie in the darkness, I'm slowly drowned to sleep
Nothing left to lose.
Three tears I've saved for you.
I'd retrace the steps that lead me here but nothing lives behind me.
So I lie in this field bathed in the light that loves me,
With nothing left to lose.
Three tears I've saved for you.

Will you be my, be my beloved?
Will you help, help me to get through?
Will you be my, be my destruction?
Will you help, help me to be through?

Oh, ooooh, oh, oooh, oh, ooooh, oh, oooh,
Oh, oooooh, oh, oooooh, oh, oooooh, ooh, oooooh!

Will you be my, be my beloved?
Will you help, help me to get through?
Will you be my, be my destruction?
Will you help,
Three tears I've saved for you
