Exert my authority
I want all thatâs known and all we see
The complete collapse of your destiny
Control
Convert your anxiety
Iâll exalt myself from decency
Wrong end in a thousand footâs control

This is the phenomenon
When all hope is lost
Caught up in another storm
And youâre sinking fast

You think youâre gonna topple the giants
Wonât you leave it up to me
Iâve got it down to a science so
Leave it up
Leave it up to...

Whatâs it gonna take to de-throw me
From atop of Mount Hypocrisy
None of you can ever break my grip of control
You go ahead and try to take me down
Really is the head that wears the crown
Listen closer, you can hear the sound of control

This is the phenomenon
When all hope is lost
So now youâve all been warned
That this time is your last

You think youâre gonna topple the giants
Wonât you leave it up to me
You wanna wear the crown of defiance
Well just leave it up to me
Whatever you want, Iâve already got it
Just leave it up to me
Iâve got it down to a science so
Leave it up
Leave it up to...

The flames are getting higher
All of my life has been erased until the flame expires
The flames are getting higher
So burn!

This is the phenomenon
When all hope is lost
The path of all the storm
Is where meeting the last

You think youâre gonna topple the giants
Wonât you leave it up to me
You wanna wear the crown of defiance
Well just leave it up to me
Whatever you want, Iâve already got it
Just leave it up to me
Iâve got it down to a science so
Leave it up
Back to fake up
For me!

(For me!)
You think youâre gonna topple the giants
(For me!)
You think youâre gonna topple the giants
(For me!)
You think youâre gonna topple the giants
