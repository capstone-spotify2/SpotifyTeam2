<i>[Intro]</i>
Singing oah
I love you moah
You're way too young for me
But I don't mind

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Never mind what your girlfriends say
Deep inside I'm quite okay
I may have fooled around once or twice
But I really need you
And it's not like I'm the only guy
I know how you make them cry
So let's start by being friends
And let this friendship never end

<i>[Bridge]</i>
I knew you years ago
When I was - I don't know
But let you say it's love

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Singing oah
I love you Moa
You're way too young for me
But I don't mind
Don't say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
'Cause you'll be fine
Yeah

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
So tell me what I want to hear
No wait - let's just leave it there
You know I'm not good for you
God - I don't know what to do!
I liked you from the start
You melt my icy heart
And now it's burning out

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Singing oah
I love you Moa
You're way too young for me
But I don't mind
Don't say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
'Cause you'll be fine

<i>[Verse 3]</i>
Don't go away
All what's left of me
I once believed you was in my soul
But if you saw me now - crying secretly
Would you hold my hand and never let it go?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Singing oah
I love you Moa
You're way too young for me
But I don't mind
Don't say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
'Cause you'll be fine

I'm Singing oah
'Cause I love you Moa
You're way too young for me
But I don't mind
Don't say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
'Cause you'll be fine
Hey!
