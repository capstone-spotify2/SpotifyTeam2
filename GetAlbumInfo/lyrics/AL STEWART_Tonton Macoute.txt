Come on to Haiti, you don't need a treaty
Papa Doc will do you OK
Tonton in the sun, he's polishing his gun
You'd better just stay out of his way.

If you turn a critical eye
He'll drill you through the middle and cry
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton Macoute
Just Tonton Macoute.

Idi Amin Dada slowly going gaga
Some say it's the yaya decay
Country's going broker but Idi he's a joker
You'd better just stay out of his way.

Anything you say that's not right
You're floating in the river at night
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton Macoute
Just Tonton Macoute.

Papa had the voodoo to bring you down and cool you
Idi learned the lesson OK
From Nero to Stalin, Froward to Mussolini
They've always had to have it their way.

But you can't make political pie
With such an hypocritical lie
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton
It's just Tonton
Just Tonton Macoute.

It's just Tonton Macoute.
