I seem to be so fucking lucky lately 
I found the key to endless treasure 
My heart is pumping and I like what I see 
Ya give me joy and give me pleasure 
Iâm on an easy ride 
I got my jewels I got a rock and 
no one can break my stride 
Iâm coming hard with heavy pockets 
But Iâm not gonna keep it 

Thatâs why I open up my bag and let it go 
Blow my cash up big and hit the road whoa 
pots of gold wonât do little brother 
if ya donât share your love with one another 
flash donât matter 
love wins over glamour 

(you got love baby) 
(you got love) 

Weâre strong alone with all my riches âround me 
couldn't get over all the diamonds 
I tried to roll in all my gold but honey 
there was no love that it could shine on shine on 
Love was far out of sight 
I was unsatisfied 
I wanna do it right 
I need to love tonight 

Thatâs why I open up my bag and let it go 
Blow my cash up big and hit the road whoa 
pots of gold wonât do little brother 
if ya donât share your love with one another flash donât matter 
love wins over glamour 

I got the secret code (yeah) 
So stand up and get a clue from me 
cold hard cash leave you cold 
if you got hot then leave and come with me 
come on 
come on and get it 
come on and get it 

Thatâs why I open up my bag and let it go 
Blow my cash up big and hit the road whoa 
pots of gold wonât do little brother 
if ya donât share your love with one another 
Cause love is the key 
To open Sesame 
You got the key 
You want the key 
You got the need 
You need a key 
You got the key 
You need a key 
You got the key 
Love wins over glamour
