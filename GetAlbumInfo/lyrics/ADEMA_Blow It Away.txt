Everyday I think about what you did
Livin' life ain't much with all the shit
Cause I'm going insane with all of it
You keep driving me crazy
Always crazy, you're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna wake up one day dead inside
Cause your alone, not in my life

I think about you sometimes
And wanna kill you
You disrespected my pride
How could you do this?

All my life has always been like this
Taking shit and I can't deal with this selfish bitch that's always full of it
You keep driving me crazy
Always crazy, you're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna wake up one day dead inside
Cause your alone, not in my life

I think about you sometimes
And wanna kill you
You disrespected my pride
How could you do this?
I'm going crazy tonight
And I blow it away

You want me to be like you
<i>[Repeat]</i>

No

I think about you sometimes
And wanna kill you
You disrespected my pride
How could you do this?
I'm going crazy tonight
And I blow it away
I think about you sometimes
And wanna kill you
You disrespected my pride
How could you do this?
I'm going crazy tonight
And I blow it away
