No candle light, no wine
No plans and thatâs just fine
Just put your hand in mine
Nothing fancy.
Donât need no party dress,
I like you just like this.
Just like the night we met,
Nothing fancy.

Girl, this is everything Iâm looking for
Thereâs nothing you could do
To make me want you more.

So I hope itâs still okay
That when I feel this way
âI love youâ is all I say,
Nothing fancy.
