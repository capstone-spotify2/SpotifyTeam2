<i>[Andie Case:]</i>
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
<i>[Together:]</i>
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
<i>[Andie Case:]</i>
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
<i>[Together:]</i>
And then we start to dance
I'm singing like

<i>[Alex Goot:]</i>
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
<i>[Andie Case (Alex Goot):]</i>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
Now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah)
Ohh, I'm in love with the shape of you
(Ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah)
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
<i>[Alex Goot:]</i>
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

<i>[Alex Goot:]</i>
Boy, you know I want your love
<i>[Together:]</i>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
<i>[Alex Goot:]</i>
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
<i>[Alex Goot (together):]</i>
Say, girl, (let's not talk too much)
Grab on my waist and (put that body on me)
Come on now, follow my lead
(Come on now, follow my lead), mmmm

Come on, be my baby, (come on)
