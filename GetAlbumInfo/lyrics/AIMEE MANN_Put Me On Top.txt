I should be knocking on the door of the pearly gates
Why keep a poor man alive in a job he hates
I've heard that good things will come to he who waits

I should be riding on a float in the hit parade
Instead of standing on the curb behind the barricade
Another verse in the doormat serenade

Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Oh, at least put some hope in the box for me

Cause it's only black and white and not a lot of each
There's a remote on the shelf, but it's out of reach

Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Put some hope in the bottom of the box for me
I need it

(Oooh, put me on top)

Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box

Put me on (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top again (change the odds)
Or at least put some hope (oooh, put me on top)
Put some home in the bottom of the box
Oh, at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
