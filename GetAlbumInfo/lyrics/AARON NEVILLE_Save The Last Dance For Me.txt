You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand beneath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so
Oh, can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
Oh, I love you, oh, so much

You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on till the night is gone, and it's time to go
(You can dance, you can dance)
If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone (You can dance)
Can he take you home (You can dance)
You must tell him no (You can dance)
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' (save) save the last dance for me

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms your gonna be
So darlin' (save) save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Save, save the last dance for me
(Save) Save the last dance for me
(Save) Save the last dance for me
Save, save the last dance for me
(Save) save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
