Every one of my words, not worth believing
Every promise I kept, kept you deceiving
Gave golden years that you erased. I split my heart and watched you take
Every drop of my soul and leave me bleeding
Yeah, you taught me this

True love wont' be remembered
My regret will last forever
Because I thought you'd never

Yeah, you brought me here

I was painfully true you were pretending
You told me this was heaven then you ascended
I gave you life, now pray for death, breathed into you, you stole my breath
You told me right from the start, we started ending
I believed in you

True love wont' be remembered
My regret will last forever
Because I thought you'd never

Yeah, you brought me here

Now I'm singing ashamed
That all my words are the same
Because I'm singing
Betrayed

Now I'm singing ashamed
That all my words are the same
Because I'm singing
Betrayed

Yeah, you brought me here

True love wont' be remembered
My regret will last forever
True love wont' be remembered
My regret will last forever
Because I thought you'd never
