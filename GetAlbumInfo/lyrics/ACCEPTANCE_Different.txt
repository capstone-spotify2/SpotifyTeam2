Tell myself on the ride home.
Getting tired, hating all I've known.
Holding on like it's all I have.
Count me out when it's clear that I
find it hard to say.
And you find it hard to care.

I wanted to see something that's different, 
something you said would change in me.
Wanted to be anything different, 
everything you would change in me.

Got this way, up front but never true.
God, I'm wrong, it's just the way I am.
Crashing down any chance you'll hear.
Caving in any chance that you, 
could see inside of me.
And I, I'll know what to say, 
It's fine, this isn't Hollywood.
So fine, getting in your way.

I wanted to see something that's different, 
something you said would change in me.
Wanted to be anything different, 
everything you would change in me.

I'm taking a chance, 
this could be different.
This could be all I'm waiting for.
Taking a chance, 
this could be different.
This could be all I'm waiting for.

I wanted to see something that's different, 
something you said would change in me.
Wanted to be anything different, 
everything you would change in me.

Something that's different (something that's different)
