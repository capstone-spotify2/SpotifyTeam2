Afro, man I know that you live in Mississippi now, but why in the hell did you leave Los Angeles man? I don't understand that.

Walking down the street without getting shot takes everything you got(That's right). A bullet proof vess across your chess sure would help a lot.(That's true, I know that's right). When you like to get away pyu.

Sometimes you wanna go where nobody knows your name (I know that's right).
They call the cops because you can. (Up against the wall black boy).

I wanna be where I can see, nobody will recognize me. I wanna go where nobody knows my name.

Where the hell is that?

Haddysburg. Mississippi, next exit. In stereo where ever available. Baaakaaaa. Deeaaaaa.
