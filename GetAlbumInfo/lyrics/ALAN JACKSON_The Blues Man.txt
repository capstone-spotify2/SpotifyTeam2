He's just a singer
A natural born guitar ringer
Kind of clinger
To sad ole songs.

He's not a walk behinder
He's a new note finder
His name's a reminder
Of a blues man that's already gone.

So he started drinkin'
Took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin'
When she came along.

He was alone in the spot light
Not too much left in sight
She changed all that one night
When she sang him this song

Hey, baby I love you
Hey, baby I need you
Hey, baby you ain't got to prove to me
You're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life
Runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light
Down on that blues man.

He got so sick from speedin'
All the things they said he was needin'
If he is to keep on pleasin'
All of his fans

He got cuffed on dirt roads
He got sued over no shows
She came and took all that ole load
Down off that blues man
And he said...

Hey, baby I love you too
Hey, baby I need you
Hey, baby I do get tired
Of this travellin band

I'm over 40 years old now
Nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out
With this blues man

He's over 40 years old now
Nights would be so cold now
If she hadn't hung around
With that blues man.
