Days will come that make no sense
My present situation makes me think too much, too much
It all revolves around you
This life that I'm living is nothing without you

I'd shed my skin for you (I'd shed my skin for you)
What would you want me to do (What would you want me to do)
I will always love you, but I can't live like this

This problem here is my fault
It's not that I don't care but I'm so lost

I'd shed my skin for you (I'd shed my skin for you)
What would you want me to do (What would you want me to do)
I will always love you, but I can't live like this

Why

Now you (rip me apart) see why
(Now you see why)
Don't fuck with feelings inside
Who you lying to? Will I survive?
I like what you put my through, 'cause I feel almost alive (Almost alive)

I'd shed my skin for you (I'd shed my skin for you)
What would you want me to do (What would you want me to do)
I will always love you, but I can't live like this
I'd shed my skin for you (I'd shed my skin for you)
What would you want me to do (What would you want me to do)
I will always love you, but I can't live like this
