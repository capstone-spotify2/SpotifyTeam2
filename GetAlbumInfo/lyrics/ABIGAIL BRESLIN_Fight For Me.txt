Oh uh oh
Oh uh oh ooo

Fight for me
Will you fight for me
Or lie to me
And say you will
I know the game I know the drill
I'd drag it out of bars and still 
It's all I got
But that's a lot so

Fight for me
Oh uh oh
Mmhhmmm

Fight for me
Please fight for me
Can't you see
You do this to yourself
You are the hand that you've been delt
The empty room where no one's left to sing to

You are the storm rising
Hold on to the greatest balance
All I want to keep is 
What keeps on leaving
Memories fade away

Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
In the end
In the end
I just wanna be you friend

Oh uh oh
Hey ya
Fight for me
Will you fight for me
Or lie to me and say you will
