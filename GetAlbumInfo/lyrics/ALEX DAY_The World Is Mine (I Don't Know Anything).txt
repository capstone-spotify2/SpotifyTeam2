My strings are broken
and my heart is out of tune.
I wanted quiet
but all I see is you.
I don't know anything.
I stumbled forward
and you let me walk away.
We both know I'll be running back to you some day.
I don't know anything.

The earth is spinning, but my feet are standing still.
The wind is biting, but I'm fighting off the chill.
I don't know anything.
So let's pretend for just one minute:
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.

They say time's a healer,
but my watch can't tell the time.
The left hand stuck 6 months ago,
and I can't find the right.
I don't know anything.
And the pen is stronger
than any sharpened sword,
but everything I write to you makes me feel like a fool.
I don't know anything.

The earth is spinning, but my feet are standing still.
The wind is biting, but I'm fighting off the chill.
I don't know anything.
So let's pretend for just one minute:
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.

I feel like I can do anything.
Why don't you understand?
I feel like I can do anything.
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you see what I could be?
Why don't you see what I could be?
Why don't you see what I could be?
Why don't you see what I could be?

So let's pretend for just one minute:
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.
The world, the world, the world, the world, the world is mine,
but you're not there.

Why can't you see?
I'd trade in the world for you.
