If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
We'll be fine

Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest
In the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right
For daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be this happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
We'll be fine...
