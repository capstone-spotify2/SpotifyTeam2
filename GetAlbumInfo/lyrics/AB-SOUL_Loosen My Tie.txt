<i>[Intro:]</i>
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, Gimme mine
Uh, gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, bitch gimme mine
Gimme mine, nigga gimme mine
Gimme mine, gimme mine

But I...

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining

Let me get it back from the top Ali

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Life
I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave
Where the hip hop radio don't play, what more can I say
I need to get away from the lights...
Flashing in my face like a topless model
And the topless bottles keep popping like a Glock
And it's coming non-stop, take a shot - don't worry about the price
Everything is paid for, you fully accommodated
When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated
Making American Pie, get you a slice
It's the American Dream, right?
So it seems I need to air out my self-esteem
It's so high

But I...

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Almost lost my life to the industry
Better yet I did, I should bury me
And I ain't even sell one record yet
And she can see I'm hanging on barely
And my bitch say I'm arrogant
Cause when she with me I feel she should cherish it
Only cause you never know when I'm a perish
Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it
Stick to the script I will - Ferris
Nobody ever said it'll be fair so
When the tabloids read "Death To Ab-Soul"
I couldn't get up, said I'll keep it on the down low
You never know what's next, or know what to expect
Still wanted for <i>[?]</i>, but now I'm a prospect
From dusk until dawn, I feel like a object
Under a telescope

But I...

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited

Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I loosen my tie
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)

<i>[Intro plays until end of song]</i>
I need a Mai Tai
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)
