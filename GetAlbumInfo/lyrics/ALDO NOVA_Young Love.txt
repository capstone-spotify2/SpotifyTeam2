Just west of 42nd street
There runs a subway line
It's a little piece of heaven
Where the sun don't shine
She's standing on the corner
She's shining like a brand new dime

She imitates a ballerina
As the train keeps time
She takes a bow
And the conductor smiles
She says, step on it James
I'm on my way to see Antonio tonight

And she knows he'll be waiting
Cause nothing can stop
Young love
So wild and willing
One part love and one part innocence
Growing up
You can't get enough
Young love

Playing saxophone
All dressed in black
His boombox blaring some Metallica track
He put a ring in his nose
His mama swears he's going to
Give her a heart attack

I give you one ma
Maybe two, maybe three, maybe four
Then he hears his baby
Knocking down the door
He says, I'll see you later Mama
Don't wait up I won't be coming home tonight

So she prays another Rosary
But mama can't stop
Young love
So wild and willing
One part love and one part innocence
The say it's wrong
But nothing can stop
Young love
Oh, baby take my hand
I don't care if they understand
Cause when it's strong
Nothing can stop
Young love

And we will be strong
Just you and me baby

Down by the tracks
On the other side
With no one watching
But the moon tonight
He was a little bit nervous
Guess you could say she was a little bit shy
But he can't stop now
Cause she might give in
Just stole second base
She said slide on in
We were halfway home
When she gave the sign
Let my sneakers run
Let her Levi's fly

Young love
So wild and willing
One part love and one part innocence
Growing up
You can't get enough
Young love
Oh, baby take my hand
I don't care if they understand
Cause when it's strong
Nothing can stop
Young love
So wild and willing
One part love and one part innocence
Growing up
You can't get enough
Young love
Nothing can stop
Young love
