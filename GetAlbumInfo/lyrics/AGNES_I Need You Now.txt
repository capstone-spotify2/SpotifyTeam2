I'm fine don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close, hard as it is to say
To total this as I barely holding on

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now ohh please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

Out here where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
Don't turn me away don't turn me away

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now ohh please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

How many times have I come to you vulnerable like this?
I know you have the right to question but please don't ask
I need you now
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
Don't turn me away don't turn me away

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now, ohh , please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming <i>[repeat x3]</i>

I need you now, I need you now
