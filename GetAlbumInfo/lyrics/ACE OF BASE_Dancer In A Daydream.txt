What an odd situation
What an odd situation

What you got is basic emotions can you feel them
I want to be your lover but you're so shy
What you need is perfect assistance let me guide you
To a land you've never seen before

I guess you see that I have another daydream
I guess you see that I have another daydream

Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in my daydream wet and wild

Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in the jungle wet and wild

To help another person will make you feel important
You got my invitaion but you're so shy
Come and let your wild side show and be a dancer
A dancer in a daydream we can share
