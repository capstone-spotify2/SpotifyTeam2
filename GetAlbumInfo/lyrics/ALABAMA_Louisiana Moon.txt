There's a ring around the Louisiana moon
And the star's are shinning bright for me and you
Wind is blowing memories cross my mind
Reminding me of all those hot nites.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Louisiana moon shine down on me tonight
Lousiana moon please help us keep it right
You were there when we started
And you'll be there until the end
Louisiana moon you will always be my closest friend.

You put a passion in the nite with your soft glow
Like you've always done those country roads
I send a message from your life here to the sea
And when it glows against her skin she'll think of me.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Louisiana moon shine down on me tonight
Lousiana moon please help us keep it right
You were there when we started
And you'll be there until the end
Louisiana moon you will always be my closest friend.

Loisiana moon you will always be my closest frined
Shine down on me tonight
Louisana moon please help us keep it right...
