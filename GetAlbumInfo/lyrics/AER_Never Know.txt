I don't got a job, but I still make sense,
Each mother fucking word coming from the breath from this chest,
With some treasure, from underneath me,
The X is where I'm digging,
Way down deep,
Seep through my skin,
Lime light lovin' lightin' me,
Rhyme tight my sight seems to be clearing up,
Steering my car down to town,
Then I pound shots, get another round,
Til I'm on the ground, Bitch know she love it,
Not above it, influenced by the best,
But I had fun with it, get with it,
Cause if you ain't with it, we'll take it from you,
Cause we better, I bet you can't do what I do,
Upsetter, get her wetter, read that letter,
I've had enough, to let her go,

And I'm gon follow you back,
And I'm gon follow you back,
And I'm gon follow you back,
To the fires burnin' in the past,
And I'm gon follow you back,
Never know, never go, yeah

Follow me (follow me)
to the heart like an artery in this game, man you gotta grow, grow
water me every day man you gotta grow, grow marijuana leaves
honestly all the matt has is his honor ask why i wanna be maybe honorary?
I'm here to stay can't afford to leave
there's so much more to me than all the squandering
so unfortunately for you she be calling me
all you got is the machine leave a message after the beep, BEEP
watch her climb in my passenger seat
she rolled up and passed it to me
takes the chick
but with me she would rather be with me
thinking she would never ever do it again
when I wake up in the morning all I think about is ballin'
fly nigga never thought about falling

I'm in the sky light
I'm in the sky light
so just follow me

I'm in the sky light, sky light
so follow me
I'm in the sky light, sky light
so follow me
