The way people smile and say
Using me in every way, its okay
Times are changing, life is upside down
No reason to cry now, oh, no reason to cry now

Beware of who you listen to 
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love
Friends are the reason for so many breakups and breakdowns
Round town, so many people think that life is so much fun
We've only just begun
Begun to have some fun

Beware of what you listen to
Beware of what you believe 
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me, to make you love
