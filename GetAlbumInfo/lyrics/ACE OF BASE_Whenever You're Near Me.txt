Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover be my friend

When every race is run and the day is closing in
I feel the need to hold you, let the night begin
Come softly to me, show me why...

Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover be my friend

I cannot wait to feel the beating of your heart
The days are long and they're just keeping us apart
Come softly to me, show me why...

Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover be my friend

Whenever you're near me

Love is the reason
We can feel this way inside, oh oh
Turning the World around and making us wild
Love is the music beating in our hearts tonight, oh oh oh
Lighting the way to take us deeper inside

When ever you're
Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover be my friend
Whenever you're near me
Someone to believe in
Whenever you're near me
You know how to please me
Someone to believe in
Be my lover be my friend
