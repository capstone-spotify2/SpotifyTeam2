Your mail's not safe in this town. <i>[4x]</i>

<i>[George:]</i> I strike a red bird on your face
And pour the kerosene in your mouth
I watch the match fall down your throat
I burn all your precious bowels
I watch the smoke pour from every crack
And breathe in your secret lives
All your bills, pay and welfare cheques
But I don't think I can stay for long
There's lots more mail that's not yet ash

Your mail's not safe in this town. <i>[3x]</i>
Well, I'm taking this all back. 

<i>[Dallas:]</i> I watch the smoke start to rise
One hundred homes, one hundred fires.
Everything you own now burns away.
This town is no longer mine.
It's fucked with me for the last time.
How I wish that I could see your face..

<i>[George:]</i> When the sky is streaked with plumes
Know that it's my signature
Upon this wretched fucking city.

Mailbox arson,
My sweet revenge. 
Mailbox arson,
My sweet revenge. 

<i>[Dallas:]</i> I'll strike a match and burn away -
Every tie that binds me to this place 
<i>[4x]</i>

<i>[George:]</i> When the smoke clears,
You can consider us even.

Your mail's not safe in this town. <i>[3x]</i>
Well, I'm taking this all back. 

<i>[Dallas:]</i> I watch the smoke start to rise
One hundred homes, one hundred fires.
Everything you own now burns away.
This town is no longer mine.
It's fucked with me for the last time.
How I wish that I could see your face..
