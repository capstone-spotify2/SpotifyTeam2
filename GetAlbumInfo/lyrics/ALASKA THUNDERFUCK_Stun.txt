Hello Gia Gunn
How's the hair?
Stun
How's the mug?
Stun
How's the track?
Stun

Rich, top knot looking like fish
At the bottom of your grocery list
Blow my lashes and make a wish
Cause I'm that bitch
Got mug for days
Got you high like purple haze
Mama said it was just a phase
Gimme bread and I'll spread it like mayonaise

<i>[Alaska Thunderfuck &amp; Gia Gunn:]</i>
So stunning
When I'm at the club
So stunning
When I'm acting up
So stunning
Can't get enough
Take it downtown bitches and I'll turn it up

Luxe
Looking like a million bucks
Black card, Swarovski tuxe
No shits, no fucks
No chickens, no ducks
Feeling like pussy
Feeling like cunt
Take me to the back and I'll show you the front
Unh, cause she shows the stunts
So mad about me like Helen Hunt

So stunning
When I'm at the club
So stunning
When I'm acting up
So stunning
Can't get enough
Take it downtown bitches and I'll turn it up

How is she though?
She's good, thank you
You look like a fucking dumpster
I feel more like a recycling bin
You look, good
Oh sorry, I cough like a man
Are you feeling your oats?
Is that what that is? I just thought it was gas
I don't like messy queens
But I certainly do love stunning queens
Are you stun?
Alright
Are you feeling stun?
A little bit
Feeling like pussy
Feeling like
Stun
