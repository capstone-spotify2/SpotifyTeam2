Someday somebody's gonna try to break, you down
Turn your back around,

But don't you let em
Let em
Let em

When they do, be you cause wall were meant to be climbed
There's never been a better time,
So go and get em
Get em
Get em

And the days you don't believe, you're gonna need to

Inhale, exhale
Take a deep breath and say yourself, you're unlimited

Whatever comes your way, you will be strong, be bold, and be brave,
Be unlimited

There's a picture on the wall of a son and his mom and dad,
They gave you everything they had, just to give you a change so make a plan, oh watcha gonna do with it

So every time they try to tell you that you're no good, just turn around and let em know that you're so good
And if they're ever feeling down let em know that you'll lift them up and help em

And the days you don't believe, those are the day you're gonna need to

Inhale, exhale
Take a deep breath and say yourself, you're unlimited

Whatever comes your way, you will be strong, be bold, and be brave,
Be unlimited

I'm unstoppable, that means nobody stopping me passing go like monopoly, I scream nobody topping me
(Sprinkles) and when I see somebody's got a dream I go and lift them up and help em, you know what I mean

I been from Green Bay to L.A. to Brooklyn, I'm looking for everybody just like me,
You're unstoppable, just like me, we're unlimited
It ain't about money,
It ain't about glory,
We all just out here trying write our own story, unlimited

Unlimited
Oh, unlimited
(Now fix your hair)
Now finish it

Inhale, exhale
Take a deep breath and say yourself
You're unlimited

Whatever comes your way, you will be strong, be bold, and be brave,
Be unlimited

No matter what they say, your gonna do it, do it your way
You're unlimited
