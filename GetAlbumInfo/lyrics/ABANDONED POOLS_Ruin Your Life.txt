Time to give it up
No one needs this any day
Your life's a half-filled cup
You'd never drink from anyway
Well I say

And if you want me to, I'd love to ruin your life
There's nothing else to do
Start a new
Ruin your life

Time to light the fuse
And watch your whole world come undone
Chaos soon ensues
Blow it all to kingdom come
Nice one

Say goodbye
Day after day you never ever crack a smile
You know it's easier to die
It's up to you
