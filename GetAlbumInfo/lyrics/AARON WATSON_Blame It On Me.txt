Your standing there, that look in your eye
Your looking for good ways to tell me goodbye
Something about people how they never know
They're loving somebody then letting them go
Your looking for reasons there ain't no need
You can blame it on me.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You can blame it on me. I was the one
Acting like real life was some old love song
I held you too close; I couldn't let go
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
You can blame it on me

Well I am too rough; I work too hard
I've got no cool friends, driving ol' cars
I'm not the picture of anyone's dreams
I'm full of bluebonnets, boots and old Jeans
Your looking for reasons -
There ain't no need; you can blame it on me.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

When you start looking
For ways outta love
Then I've been making mistakes by the dozen
So if you wanna leave
You can blame it on me

I held you too close; I couldn't let go
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
To blame it on me.

All on Me

You can blame it on me
