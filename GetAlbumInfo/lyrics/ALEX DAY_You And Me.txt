We knew it from the start
that we would be together in some way.
You needed me
and you know I still need you back.
Don't get the wrong idea,
we both know what this is and how it ends,
but I can't wait
to share all this with you.

Let's run away where they won't find us now.
We'll hide far away and we'll be free.
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)

The time will go so fast,
but we will savor every moment that we share,
and I will give myself to only you.
And when you go back home,
I'll count the days 'til I can run with you
and see your face
and fall asleep for one more night.

Let's run away where they won't find us now.
We'll hide far away and we'll be free.
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
(Bo-doop, bo-doop, bo-doop)
