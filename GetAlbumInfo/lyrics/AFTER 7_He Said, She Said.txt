Aw Randy Ran what's up. 
We talkin' bout girlies

If you think your wrong, then you know your right
Gettin' into my business, just ain't satisfied
Better stop dippin' girl
It don't become of you
You got too much time on your hand oh baby

If your lovin' me
Keep on lovin' me
Don't let this silly girl distract you from me
All she wants is
To get you away from me, don't fall into that trap

He said, she said, we said, we don't need it
He said, she said, we said we don't need it. 

I know you want me
But you cant have me
My love is tied up with my girl right now
You told her you saw me
Just the other day, kickin' it with the invisible woman

How could you try such a silly willy game
The two of us we're not havin' it no way
My sweet heart is my only lover
Don't play me like a sho nuff fool nooooo

(Aw kevon here they come talkin' that mess)
(Wait a minute, can I say somethin',
The girlie ain't got no business in my business)
(That's right)

He said, she said, we said, we don't need it
He said, she said, we said we don't need it.

He said, she said, we said, we don't need it
He said, she said, we said we don't need it.
