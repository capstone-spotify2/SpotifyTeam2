<i>[Intro - Ab-Soul:]</i>
All my life
All my life

<i>[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]</i>
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was tight
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was sick
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was ill
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was I'll be here

<i>[Verse - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Everywhere, tell the truth you wouldn't dare
Cross me like the gold you wear
Soulo flow like the solar flare in the open air
So much smoke that I'm comatose, but I still want mo'
TDE generals, she ain't spiritual but she still want Soul
God bless, God body, no fear in nobody, no thing
Can I proceed? Collect all of my proceeds
Don't I flow like I don't bleed? Every cut is just dumb
After me there will be none I told you there is only one (Soul)
Yeah, and I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's sober hopin' so it's 'stood
I'm in Hollywood cause I remember when I had 50 Cent, up In Da Club
All my life I knew I was major, I don't need no major
I don't even write rhymes, I really shouldn't have to sign paper to dominate the
Game yall praise on hand and knee, just waited till it came to me
I just kept it real with yall, keeping it real with me

<i>[Hook - Ab-Soul and JMSN:]</i>
Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Trying to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we bout here
Who really bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears
Cause we really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here!
(We really out here, yeah yeah yeah!)

<i>[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Uh, and it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
Fuck the same hoes again, bumpin' "Druggies Wit Hoes Again" with my bros again
No, I want the world chico and everything in it
Every beverage with Codeine in it
How the fuck you say I sold my spirit?
I'm still taking blows at the Senate
Claims of Illuminati, I'm just tryna Illuminate
Praise to the most high, God, Jah, Allah, Yahweh
Selassie eye and I'm proud to say, I never need a 9 by my waist
Niggass still respect my gangster, celestials respect my space
And I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over ho, it's over stud
I was overlooked, I went overboard now I'm overbooked
Ab-Soul-Lute just, my life is like an open book
Read between the lines nigga
I did this shit legally blind nigga
Yeah, Soulo ho, Carson arson with Del Amo (Knock Knock!)
Tell your folks I said hello, I ain't never scared

<i>[Break - Ab-Soul (Interview):]</i>
These days, at this point in my life, I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days instead of just staying in the dumps, just keep going. Bring light to the situation, maybe, you know, try to find your own personal message in that incident, that experience and try to move forward

<i>[Battle Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Y'all got me, everything good, y'all can hear me?
Before we start, lemme just say this, lemme just say this
I'm dating you Day
Wait, wait, pause
No gay shit
What's the difference between a date and a day anyway Day?
A date is a day that's marked
I'm smart, and just cause I know you love 'em so much
I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
My database said Day the basehead that date a basehead
Is he dope? No
Who gave Day the base, ball is what we do best
Flock his projects, that's a home run, Day
The baseball is what we do best
Carpe diem, that's how you say seize the day in French
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor this grape is green
I gotta eat on the go Day
I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way
Don't go a long way, what?
A ho in Chipotle, no
This is food for thought, from a dog on top
We been nuts
There was a fool who thought we was new to this
But who knew this would end up, a glow stick and a uterus
That's light in a box
And that's light, that's light
But light like to lick twat a lot so that's right
That's what y'all call street?
No tales from the Crip this evening, he slip
Seems he forgot what the C meant
It's your dumbass fault that last part was so concrete
But I guess you'd have to be Ken to get that bar b, pardon me
I bet right about now you feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball to clear your thoughts before raw backwards
And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull before you let the Jordan downs and Jordan down
Now, as for the crew
Well, uhh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog
And this nigga bought, what, a hundred and three dalmatians?
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
And I'm a fan first
But it won't take too many seconds to leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
I put this man in ERs if he don't got no manners, man word
I'm expectin' some etiquette in your segment kid
I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here
They can't see you
Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do
And you don't appear to be a peer to me, forreal
You should kneel to me or somethin'
Fuck it, to keep it 100
You're nil to me, that's nothing
Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street, that's crazy right?
That's what happens when you expose them grapes to too much daylight
So your chances of standin'
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son?
Shed some light on Day?
'Til he's cropped out
No not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you
The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued
You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter, coward
You're counterfeit
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see quill drug over the counter
After your mother consumed you, you were the fruit of the womb
After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Loom
Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip?
Or just another fruit in this room?
It's crucial, you choose, I'm sure you don't want me to assume
I should be against the law to run into
Cause we all know in LA I'm double you, all so true
Today is the day I split Day in two
What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into?
Are you from Gotham or from Watts?, Are you Batman, Spawn, or Davon?
Did you really think "Paul Walker" was a dope song?
If so, you were wrong
Hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me
Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G?
Don't be so transparent, this nigga's light - through
If you don't know what transparent means, let me enlighten you
If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through
So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' light through
Like, he nerve of this cat
Lyin' with a motionless emotion
This nigga Day all bitch
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get kilt
Do Quill got skill at all, homie?
It was some Braveheart shit, all I heard was Nas, homie
Did you really expect to last, Day?
You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days
I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy but did you get to that page?
You got Gats?
You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon?
Forget it Day, no, really, forget this day
If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see
Just how many people would say "Yes" to Day
Nobody, fam, nobody, fam
That's why I'm ahead to day
No, no body fam, that's why I'm a head today
No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day
Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day
Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day
It's only right I be blunt to Lyt
I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt
I see I should have used the lighter instead
Chill Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple
We need the fire instead
When I think of daylight, I think of shit like
Breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'
See where I'm goin'?
That means you better break fast, or I'll have your family mournin''
When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it
But you know what?
(Hold on, hold on, let me get you right, we have this shit)
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
Say this, let me say this, let me just say this
These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory
You're Buzz Lightyears from here, Quill, and you tellin' toy stories
You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes
All your bars HÃ¤agen-Dazs, that's on everything
Day a dairy queen, Deluxe, Blessed king
Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse
You know I brought a hearst for the sausage you brought worst
Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine that tried To let it shine
And I hate that we have to
Hear the lies from this little light of mine that tried
To let it shine
But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt
You get it, Lyt?
That's how you ILL-u-min-ate, and finish Lyt, good night
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get you right
You got that for me?)
Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks

<i>[Battle Verse 2 - Daylyt:]</i>
Question, you know how many copies The Matrix sold?
It don't matter, The Matrix's old
I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch
No, no, no
Face it, I got it covered
Prevail, they say the sail was a thread to Hell
The gravitational stitch cause some niggas seem down
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear
Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
I retire niggas, I'm the <i>[?]</i>, I could OD too
And even the odds some
He thought he could least get a baby victory
But all he got was "Nah, son"
Check this out, he not ready
Either you fight back or I ether you
Thought you could face what I hand you, well this is impeccable
Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked
Peep at you, put everything at stake
Well done, this is beef, right?
Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, soul before you get meatsliced
I'm from the third, I gotta try you
Guy you play Ryu, lose a Ken in street fight
<i>[?]</i>
You still couldn't see Lyt
Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit
Pilot, fly, I be the goblin
We battle for a stack, in fact they had to get a cataract cause I be the problem
But it's useless, use less filler
Excuse this, excuses, but, but, but
These asscheek niggas dead
You said you would fry Day previously
But that's what the last week nigga said
But, but, but, keep cool Joe cause a dog crazy
Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up
He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino, nigga you better duck
But I tell them tails we never tuck
We gon' line that ass up
I from the Watts block for decision
My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out
We played hopscotch for a livin'
But that's def, that's just plain old def
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Have a seat, picture this, picture this photo
This a Soulo <i>[?]</i>, hold up
Is it because he 'bout to get smoked?
Common roll the physics, so exquisite, thought I was in here dolo
No bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission
The deal closed, SoHo is it
Thought you could fuck with Me Gal? I gotta Cotto split him
Look at your girl dead in her eyes and say "Fuck Dorothy dog"
I'm toto dissin'
But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as Hell
As I release bars, they better bail
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned
Minus sinus, the stuffy nose flew overhead, it's cold
Redemption, stay still, as I apply Dayquil
Cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me
See where mind be is a mine, explosive
Interior is inferior, this is a hobby probably
Y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate
These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day, remember
You did say you would fry Day
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
Preacher for they peeps, you asshole
You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat
I tell 'em I got the foreign
Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish
Game, I play is death, get sword for the hoodish
Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage
I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you
I need a lot of space, the galactic crew, the actors knew
You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do
But you got the roots stirred up
Gelatin dropped and slide, this game is stormchasin'
Based on whether you got the drive
Win rounds, destroy their whole city
Will they get toured? Nay, do you realize
I still got a break, brother
When I quake in action, think of Blake and Jackson
Take cover
That's Lyt work, Soul
Cut your lights switch, see how the Lyt works, Soul
I cut the light switch off and your light switch off, Soul
Somebody get this nigga help
I mean, like, Soul, assist him
Get him help, I'm sendin' this nigga out the Solar System
I mean it's simple, Aretha Franklin, you a soul sister
(That's enough, man Imma have to throw one of these masks on, man
Should I finish him off?
Use the mask, Day
I ain't done)
And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the quill
And I gotta give 'em the skill
I be on the tip like I tried to give 'em the bill
New approach, Bull coach, I tried to give 'em the Phil
For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal
Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real
You can't back up defeat but I try to get up the hill
Cold, rack up the heat but I'm tired of niggas that grill
Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest
Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest
Platform, see where I come from, it was sirens
Blackboards, eyelids see the violence, what is that for?
44 shoot, they screamin', "Who's that guy?"
Jesus, his face, they screamin', "Who's that god?"
We be on the top, careers gettin' too high
They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy
That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly
Tragic, twin maggots, I grew up too fly
They askin, "Who I?" in front of that triangle black
That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat
We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission
Older now, I'm in the Rover but it's not a Mars mission
Settle down, one child, marry, feel like I'm Marge pimpin'
Bitches wanna eat my shorts, feel like I'm Bart Simpson
I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin'
They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin'
But you got it, you got it bad
2Pac, <i>[?]</i>
Two watches, that's pocket change
Dude coppin' that clock exchange
Credit good, I'ma pull the card out
Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out
Cough, they can show that they're stomach so they fall out
Whip, double roof, dog barkin' in the dog house
And I gotta give 'em the Lyt
My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight
Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic
Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life
Wow, they say the Bugatti went up in price
Wow, that's a million
I'm done

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Ces jours-ci, je suis trÃ¨s concentrÃ©
