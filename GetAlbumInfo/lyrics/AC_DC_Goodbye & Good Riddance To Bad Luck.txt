Gettin' bombed out on booze
Got nothin' to lose
Run outta money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels like livin' in hell
The girls on the hustle with nothin' to sell
Want something for nothing it's always the same
Keep pushin' an' shovin' and I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Well spread out the news there's a free man loose
Back out of jail and chasin' some floos'
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim for monetary gains
Wantin' what's coming all for the take
Freedom for lovin' an lust for the taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye good riddance to bad luck
Broken the chains of bad luck
Bye bye bye bad luck
Thrown of the chains of bad luck

Goodbye good riddance
To bad luck
