And youâre like a nineties Jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you?
And you sample concepts like hors dâoevres
And you eat their questions for dessert

Is it just me or is it hot in here?

And youâre like a nineties Kennedy
And youâre really a million years old
You canât fool me
Youâll throw opinions like rocks in riots
And youâll stumble around like hypocrites

Is it just me or is it dark in here?

Well you may never be a high husband
You may never have a whole child
You will learn to lose everything
Be a temporary arrangement

Ai-yi-yi...

And youâre like a nineties Noah
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
And they wonder why youâre frustrated
And they wonder why youâre so angry

And is it just me or are you fed up?

Ai-yi-yi...

God bless you in your travels
In your conquests and your queries
