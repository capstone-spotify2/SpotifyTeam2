The streets is cryin' man
I know y'all miss your boy
Konvict music he he

Yeah, real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cause in the hood niggas jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

I'm gangsta, I never left, I just had to chill
Me and 50 runs, you niggas that we still kill
Stacks in the grass tryna police mix
Say I'm livin' too large, I'm obese nigga
8 hundred million then I cashed out
You ain't got it but now within' your hair style
I read the blueprint and then I ran with it
Gave it to Boo, he went and milked his grand with it

Yeah, real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cause in the hood niggas jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

In position of power so now they hear me
May not admit it but I know these niggas hear me
Every year I grind harder than the last one
Life's short, you never know when it's your last one
Black as fuck my girlie, I'm a call us the Steelers
Keep a hundred when niggas in hide between us
You wanna my hustle just know I supply the dealer
All you live in a jungle and you ain't a gorilla

Yeah, real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cause in the hood niggas jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'
