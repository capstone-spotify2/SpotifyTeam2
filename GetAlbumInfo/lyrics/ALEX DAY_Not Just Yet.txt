Goodnight, lay down and close your eyes
All things have to die but not just yet

Iâm here, Iâll always be around
We could both fall down but not just yet

Tomorrowâs still a day away
And it will always stay that way

Goodnight, for now we've reached the end
This will start again but not just yet

Goodnight, our time is all but gone
Iâll have to move on but not just yet
For now, I want to share my life
Youâll be out of sight but not just yet

Tomorrowâs still a day away
And it will always stay that way

I hope you wonât forget the time we had
When we laughed our way through movies we had paid too much to see
All the photographs that we forgot to take
And the train tickets you told me we should never throw away

I hope you wonât regret the time we had
Stolen glances through the darkness staying close to fight the cold
All the memories that we forgot to make
And the way you fit a lifetime into every single day
So letâs have one more day

Tomorrowâs still a day away
And it will always stay that way
Tomorrowâs still a day away
And it will always stay that way

Goodnight, for now we've reached the end
This will start again but not just yet
