I get tired of life
What a world I'm living in
Now I've got it all
I've had enough, I'm giving in

The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

A king for a day

Stuck in this toxic town
It really takes my breath away
It's either leave or drown
I'm on a blue sky getaway

The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

A king for a day

The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

A king for a day
