Ba bom bom...
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to ride around in a dirty ol'  truck
Catch a bunch of fish and shoot a bunch of duck
It's alright to be a redneck
Chase around girls on Friday night.
You wanna make 'em feel alright

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to work hard in the sun all day
Drink a couple beers after balin' hay
It's good to be a redneck
Drive by Ernie's for some barbecue
Showin' off your brand new boots

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's alright, it's alright,
It's alright to be a redneck

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
The kids are gonna cry 
and the chickens gonna fry
Oh, you know it
Your car won't run 
so your cousin's comin' by to tow it

Ba bom ba bom...
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to have a girl
name'a Thelma Lou
That don't mind a little kiss 
when you got a little chew
Party on the road
By the light of the moon
Dancin' to a country tune

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's alright, it's alright,
it's alright to be a redneck
it's alright, it's alright,
it's alright to be a redneck

<i>[Tag]</i>
Yeah...it's alright, it's just right,
it'a alright to be a redneck
Ba bom bom...
