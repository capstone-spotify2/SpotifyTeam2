These are the words I say
When I want you near to me
From that place deep
In my heart
You will see

I'm never far away anytime
Any place
When you reach out
For my love
I'll be there, yeah

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you when
You're falling

I will be here for you, baby
Let me love you

When the world's too
Hard to bear
And you need a helping hand
I'll be there, the one to help
You understand

If you wander far away,
Zambia or Monterey
I'll be there the one to
Wash your tears away

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you
When you're falling

I will be here for you, baby
Let me love you ooh, ooh
I wanna love baby,
Let me love you

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you
When you're falling

I will be here for you baby,
Let me love you

Nitakungodea milele

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you
When you're falling

I will be here for you baby,
Let me love you

Nitakungodea milele
Nitakungodea milele

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you when
You're falling

I will be here for you baby,
Let me love you

I will be here for you, baby
I will be here for you when
You're falling

When you're fallin' baby,
I'll be around the corner
