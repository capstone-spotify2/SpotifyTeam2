I came home, in the morning
Just a little bit ago
You lie asleep in our bed
All twisted in your clothes

And the rain came down on our rooftop
With a rhythm like this
Let the hair stand up
On my shoulders when you open your mouth

Said, aaaahhh
Said, aaaaahh

So I wrote you a letter
Etched into my forearm
With the pen that you gave me
Said there's one thing that I mustn't fear
This is happening
This is happening...

Wish that I was strong enough,
Wish that I could give it all,
Wish that I could change enough,
To be yours

Wish that I could give it all,
Wish that I was strong enough,
Wish that I could change enough,
To be yours

Wish that I was strong enough,
Wish that I could give it all,
Wish that I could change enough,
To be yours

Wish that I could give it all,
Wish that I could change enough, 
Wish that I was strong enough,
To be yours
