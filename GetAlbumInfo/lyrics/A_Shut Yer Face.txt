So come out fighting, second's out
Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt
Got one thing on your brain, you all act the same
But you're alright

'Cos you are from Venus and I am from Mars
You'd like your penis as big as your car
Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!
Yeah, you're alright

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway

It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk
You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!
You're never wrong, so bring it on
'Cos you're alright
'Cos I are from Venus and you am from Mars
You buy me panties that don't match my bras
Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to
Then it's alright

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway

Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you
Beating you down with my words over you
You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental
But you're alright

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
