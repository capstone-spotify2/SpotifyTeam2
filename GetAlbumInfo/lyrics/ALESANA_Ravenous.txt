Reap what you sow
Do you believe yourself?
The lies you tell so well?
I hope you rot in hell
Yea! I'm gonna watch as you breakdown

From the shadows you strum on your web of influence
Consuming your victims from the inside
A spider to the end

You think you're innocent?
You think you're relevant?
You're such a hypocrite!
Yea! And now it's time for the payback!

Never forget who you are, stick to your guns
Reflections live through the night
Are you just a sucker buying time?
You drink it down, the clover poisons your lungs
They welcome you out of spite
Much to your twisted delight

I guess that I will never know exactly what they see in you

You have finally done it, you outsmarted the mirror
And believe the lies you told
Now you are complete, a jester and a fraud
When you smile at me I doubt you realize what I see
A shadow where once stood a fool

Reap what you sow
You think you're innocent?
You think you're relevant?
You're such a hypocrite!
Yea! And now it's time for the payback!

Never forget who you are, stick to your guns
Reflections live through the night
Are you just a sucker buying time?
You drink it down, the clover poisons your lungs
They welcome you out of spite
Much to your twisted delight

I guess that I will never know exactly what they see in you
In the end I will be the one standing and they'll be over you

Seems temptation finally found you
And now we'll watch you drown in your greed, in your lust
Swallow it down if it helps you sleep at night

Tell me more about the tour, hack!
About your crowds (&amp;) how great they were! Go on!
Convince me that its real art, smile for the cameras
And assure me that you have a soul!
What have you become, trash?!
Such a damn disgrace, a waste!
They will scream that you're a charlatan
When you beg, "what have I done"?!

Never forget who you are, stick to your guns
Reflections live through the night
Are you just a sucker buying time?
You drink it down, the clover poisons your lungs
They welcome you out of spite
Much to your twisted delight

I guess that I will never know exactly what they see in you
In the end I will be the one standing and they'll be over you
