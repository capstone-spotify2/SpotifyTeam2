I was born the son of a card shark
With a deck in my hand
I'm the best at playin' the game
I'm known throughout the land

At the tables you'll find me
A stack of chips by my side
Poker, gin, or 21
A winning hand is my pride

Just cut the pack
I'll take the one-eyed Jack
There's no holding back
I call your bluff

It ain't no crime
Winning all the time
When money's on the line
I play for blood

I'm the five card stud!
Don't try to con me
Let's get it understood
You'll never put one past me
'cause I know every trick in the book

Let's play for double or nothing
If you think you 're so good
Let's go for broke
Afraid you're gonna choke

You got one slim hope
That ain't a 'nuff
Well, you're outta luck
You lost your bottom buck

I hit a royal flush
And I smell blood

I'm the five card stud!

Let's go for broke
Afraid you're gonna choke

You got one slim hope
That ain't a 'nuff
'cause I'm the five card stud!

I'm the five card stud!

C'mon!!
