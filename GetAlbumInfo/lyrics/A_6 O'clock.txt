6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio
The radioooo-oh 

Get out, get out, get out, yeah 

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band, but he's got his eye on mine
There a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time - at any time! 

When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
We all go the same way 

6 O'12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone! 

Get out, get out, get out yeah
Get out, get out, get out! 

When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
It's alright, it's OK
