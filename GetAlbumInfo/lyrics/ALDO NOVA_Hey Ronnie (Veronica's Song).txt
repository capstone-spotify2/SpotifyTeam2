She was 19 I was 25
When I saw her for the first time
I met her at the station
She was working overtime

Just a pretty tomboy pumping gas
When I asked her name she smiled
She said, they call me Ronnie
So we sat and talked awhile

Well we laughed and joked
And spoke of dreams
Again and again
It was more than love could have ever been
Baby you were my friend

Hey hey Ronnie
We were wild as the wind
Me and Ronnie
We'll be together till the end
Two beautiful dreamers
But the dream it had to end in the end

The summer nights they had to fade
And the winter came on strong
But even on the coldest nights
Our love would keep us warm

Well we had to scrape to pay the rent
Working too hard to hold on
Nights with you were heaven sent
It was the days that all went wrong

We were tough
Just a little too proud
Too pack it in, to walk right out
So let it fade let the movie end
Forever friends

Hey hey Ronnie
We were wild as the wind
Me and Ronnie
Swore that love was everything
Somewhere we got lost
And now I miss you my friend

So when you're out there
In the cold cold world
Ronnie girl think about me

Well, ain't it funny how the years go on
True love never dies
My dream of being Elvis
All but passed me by

Well I wonder if she's pumping gas
I bet she's doing fine
Hey Ronnie if you're out there
I could use a friend tonight

Ronnie
Hey hey Ronnie
We were wild as the wind
Me and Ronnie
Swore that love was everything
Hey hey Ronnie
We were wild as the wind
Me and Ronnie
