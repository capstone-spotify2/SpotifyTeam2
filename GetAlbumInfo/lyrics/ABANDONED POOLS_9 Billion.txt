Don't mean to freak you out
But I'm painting pictures
Memories we'll have someday
Don't mean to put you out
But I'm changing channels
So we can stay in bed all day
But all I want is strictly earthly
Sweat and toil and debauchery
Full of love and urgency
I am just a raging sea

Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life

Don't mean to freak you out
But the doubt is over
And everything is changing ways
Compared to what you do to me
I am just a ranging sea

Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life

In this room I forget about me
Sedate myself with bland TV

Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life
