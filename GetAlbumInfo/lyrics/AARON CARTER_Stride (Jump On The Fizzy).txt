Here we go
Here we go

The name is AC
And I'm here to make it hot
I step into a room you could hear a pin drop
Now I know you know
I rocked alot of tunes
Ryhme so high, I fly ya to the moon
Don't try to take me out
I'm the one who beat Shaq
Said come and get it
and told you where it's at
9 o'clock on the dot
I partied down the block
I get my crew together
And I make a pit stop
Grab Kara, then Sara
Lisa, Mandy, and Tara
I got Jenny
Then Jessie
Now we're all chillin'

Jump On The Fizzy
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
You know we're gonna hold it down
Well, we're gonna keep it movin'
Ain't noting but a good time
Yeah, we're gonna shout it loud
Well, we're gonna keep it movin'

(Jump On The Fizzy)
(Jump On The Fizzy)

So listen up
Check it out
Cuz this is kinda phat
No I ain't crazy
I'm an animaniac
Bustin rhyems like Leanne
Can you kick it (Yes I can)
Ain't no fanatic
I'm just a big fan
Take your left hand
Right hand
Raise em to the sky
Take one step back
And one to da side
11 O'clock on the dot
The party's getting hot
All the girls on the floor
Hear my beat drop
Yo Kara and Sara
Lisa, Mandy, and Tara
Yo Jenny and Jessie
We're all chillin'

Jump on the fizzy
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
You know we're gonna hold it down
Well, we're gonna keep it movin'
Ain't noting but a good time
Yeah, we're gonna shout it loud
Well, we're gonna keep it movin'

Put your hands up

Put your hands high

And we're bouncin' wit the crowd

Put your hands up
