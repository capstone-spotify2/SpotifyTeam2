I can't wait to get with you
Thinking about the last time I laid with you
Drove me crazy out of my mind
I can't wait to lay with you
Like july the fourth explode in you
It drives me crazy out of my mind

I'll be giving up this good thing
To my honey
I'll be giving up this good thing
To my honey, all my lovin'

It's the kind of love that makes you cry
It feels so good it makes you
Moan and sigh
It feels so good it makes you wanna say
Oh this love is good it hurts so good
It's so good, so good

Girl it's the kind of love that gets

That gets so deep, and all you do is
Roll over and go to sleep
Come on in and close the door
I'll fill you up with love

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I can't wait another minute
To get in you, after we make love
Roll over, and do it again and again
And again and do it again
Turn off the lights, unplug the phone
Turn off the t.v., lay on your back
Open your mind, baby receive me.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'll be sexing you all night
I'll be sexing you all night
