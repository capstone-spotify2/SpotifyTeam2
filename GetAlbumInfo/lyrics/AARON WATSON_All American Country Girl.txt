If you'd had made a tag on the back
Of those designer jeans she's wearin'
It's some big name brand you can't buy at a Wal-mart
And you from what she's got on

From her Versace to her Louis Vuitton
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by heart

But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl

Well she comes pullin' up to you at a red light
In some high-fallutin fancy foreign car
Rich lady shades and a little dog in the window
You'd never know she was born and raised right down on her grandaddy's farm

But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl

There's somethin' bout her slow southern twang
It sweet talks me into anything
Her smile, her wink, and her pretty please
Brings any country boy down to his knees

But when it comes down to the heart of the situation 
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
