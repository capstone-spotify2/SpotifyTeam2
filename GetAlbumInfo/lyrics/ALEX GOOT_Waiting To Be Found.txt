I could easily lie to you and say
That I donât like her
But thatâs exactly how it feels to be hurt
Nothing ever seems to go the right way now
Nothing ever seems fair
Every day is the same and nothingâs changed but my hair

I wanna know how it feels to love again
I wanna know right now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found by someone new

As Iâm wandering through my head again
I can never really tell
Am I dreaming or is all of this real
Lots of people like to tell me where to go
What to do and what to say
I help myself to all advice that helps me

I wanna know how it feels to love again
I wanna know right now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found by someone new

Yeah,
Iâm waiting to be found by someone new
By someone new
Yeah,
Iâm waiting to be found by someone new
Iâm waiting
But no one new is finding me

I wanna know how it feels to love again
I wanna know right now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Iâm waiting to be found
Iâm waiting to be found

I wanna know how it feels to love again
I wanna know right now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found
(waiting to be found)
Iâm waiting to be found by someone new

Waiting to be found by someone new
