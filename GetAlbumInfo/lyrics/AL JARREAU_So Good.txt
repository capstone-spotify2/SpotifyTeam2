There's no greater crime
Than wastin' your life
On a boat goin' nowhere
When you came along
You made it safe
For love to survive
I trusted and dreamed
And you came like I knew you would
I've been 'round before
But this feels so good

I could not walk by
I knew that I'd found
What's at the end of the rainbow
There's no place on earth I'd rather be
Than stayin' right here with you
It's not about luck
I don't need to knock on wood, no no
Been 'round before
But this feels so good

Night after night
It's so hard to believe
That I wake up each day next to you
Time after time
In the cold mornin' light it's good to know
It's good to know that it's true

There's no greater sin
Than missin' your chance
But when it's starin' right at 'ya
That look in your eyes
Say everything and tells me I'm home
For once in my life
You know I don't feel misunderstood
Well I've been 'round before
Oh but this time you know it feels so sure
Been 'round before
But this feels so good
Been, been 'round before
This feels so good

You all sing
So good, so good, so good
So good, so good, this feels so good
This is what I mean
Exactly what I am talking about
This feels so good
So good, so good so good
So good, so good
This feels so good
So good, so good, so good
So good
