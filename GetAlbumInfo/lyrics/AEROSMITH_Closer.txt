How many times can you turn away
You fall in love and then love falls away
You turn out the love when you turn out the lights
You hit the heavens when you hit the heights
How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me

Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
Itâs a give and take every time we break, I get closer
You get closer too

I love you baby till death due us part
If loveâs on a man why not un-break my heart
You start so many things so why not letâs dance
2 times in love or a one time romance
How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me

Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
Itâs a give and take every time we break, I get closer
You get closer too

And I donât know why we fight
Whatâs wrong with always being right
Itâs always those damnedest things, 
Can angels fly on broken wings
And every night when Iâm alone in bed
I still smell your perfume
Then I wake up and I swear, I swear
I still remember

Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer
Itâs a give and take every time we break, I get closer
You get closer too
