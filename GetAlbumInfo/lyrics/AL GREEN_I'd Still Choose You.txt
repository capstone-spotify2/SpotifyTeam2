I can love you ten thousand years, oh baby
I'd still feel the same, life's been a <i>[?]</i>, oh baby
I'll have to keep on forever loving you, oh baby
Makes no matter what, what you say or do

If I had to do it all over
If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd still choose you
I'd still choose you

I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
Before I can make your sweet love mine, oh baby
I'll put the ring back on your finger, oh baby
<i>[?]</i> never linger

If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
And I would still choose you

Every flower I pick, dear darling
Would be roses all around
We go through life's ups and downs
Until your love hits the ground

I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
I know it's all <i>[?]</i>, oh baby
I still trust you, I grow in you
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
I, I'd hold you, until the time sake, forever

If I had to do it all over
I'd would do it all over
<i>[?]</i> it all over
I'd still choose you

Do it all over
Let me do it all over
Do it all over
And I would still choose you

Do it all over
I wouldn't take it all over
I'm gonna do it all over
I would still choose you
I love you, lady

Do it all over
Do it all over
Do it all over
I'd still choose you
