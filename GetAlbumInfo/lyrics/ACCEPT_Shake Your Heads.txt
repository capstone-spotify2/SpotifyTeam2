See the world around you
Deep, dark and grey
Grieving heartbreaks all your life
Seems to be the way

Wars of aggression
Mankind's favourite game
A press on the button
A world in flames

Every night and every day
Frustrations in your heart
Like a one way ticket
No return - you're torn apart

Shake your heads 'till your necks are breaking
Shake your heads - cry out as loud as you can
Shake your heads 'till your brains are burning
Shake Your heads - cry out as loud as you can

Play the easy rider - ride fast and free riding
The cost of living don't mean much to me

Your life is a replay
So forget the games you loose
We've got a message
That was made for you

Some say yes and some say no
Understanding is the deal
Come hear the music
It's a brand new feel

Shake your heads 'till your necks are breaking
Shake your heads - cry out as loud as you can
Shake your heads 'till your brains are burning
Shake your heads - cry out as loud as you can

Shake your heads 'till your necks are breaking
Shake your heads - cry out as loud as you can
Shake your heads 'till your brains are burning
Shake your heads - cry out as loud as you can

Shake Your heads, ...
