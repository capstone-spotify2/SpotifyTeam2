I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody

I need somebody
I need somebody

Please don't leave me alone
I'm tired of being by myself
No, don't you leave me on this shelf

Please don't leave me alone
Help me find my dancin' shoes
Oh help me heal these black and blues

I live just down the way
You wont have to stay
Just small talk and Jasmine tea
Spend some time with me
Here just watchin' the rain
Take a moment and give me sweet
Lovin' company

You say you know what I mean
Tired of keepin' house for one
No, solo dancin' ain't no fun
If you know what I mean
Cant you come and help me through
Oh I would do the same for you

I live just down the way
We wont have to stay
Sweet dreams in town tonight
Lets go feel the light
Leave those blues in the rain
Take a moment and give me
Some sweet lovin' company

Listen to me don't you see what
I mean
Come on baby, lets do the booty green
This is the way to forget those bad dreams

Oh, don't you feel more like yourself
So good to be down off the shelf
We finally found our dancin shoes
Guess we beat these black and blues

I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody

Guess we beat those black and blues
