blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand
ain't seen the daylight since we started this band
no more, no more <i>[2x]</i>
store-bought clothes fallin' 'part at the seams
tea leaf-readin' gypsies fortune-tellin' my dreams
no more, no more <i>[2x]</i>
Holiday Inn, lock the door with a chain
you love 'em and you hate it but to me they're all the same
no more, no more <i>[3x]</i>
baby I'm a dreamer
found my horse and carriage
stalemate jailbait ladies can't refuse
you love 'em then you leave 'em with your sold out reviews
no more, no more <i>[2x]</i>
sweet-talkin' bar room ladies disease
slippin' with her lips slidin' down your knees
no more, no more <i>[3x]</i>
*** screamer
bound to a wife in marriage
baby I'm a dreamer
found my horse and carriage
ladies hold the aces while my lovers call it passion
the men call it pleasure but to me it's old fashioned
times they're a-changin' nothing ever stands still
if I don't stop changin' I'll be writin' my will
it's the same old story never get a second chance
for a dance to the top of the hill
babe I'm a dreamer
found my horse and carriage
