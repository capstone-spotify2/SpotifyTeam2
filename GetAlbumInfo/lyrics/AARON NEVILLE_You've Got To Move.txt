You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
When the lord gets ready, ready for you
You gotta move, oh yeah, you gotta move

You may be high
You may be low
You may be rich
You may be poor
When the lord gets ready, ready for you
You gotta move, oh, you gotta move

You may be lame
And you cannot walk
You may be mute
And you cannot talk
But when the lord gets ready, gets ready for you
You gotta move, you gotta move

You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
When the lord gets ready, ready for you
You gotta move, yeah yeah, you gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
You gotta move
When the lord gets ready, you've got to move
You've gotta move
