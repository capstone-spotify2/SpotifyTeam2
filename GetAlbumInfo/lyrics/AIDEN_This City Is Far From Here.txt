A bloodstained shirt, seductive smile, 
with eyes full of hate and murders in style. 
The sky turns red, the air is cold, 
with one last chance to do as Iâm told. 
This city is far from here. 
Now turn back, turn back. Iâm scared, 
but in the bright lights we fade 
into the rearview mirror. 

This is the last attempt at a mere goodbye. 
It's just beginning. 
Does this story have an end? 
Can you feel my empty heart 
inside a box and barely beating? 
The walls are closing in. 
So take my hand, weâll run forever âtill it ends.

Look what Iâve done now, youâre dying from love and youâre bleeding. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming. 
Look what Iâve donât now, Iâm sick of this town and Iâm leaving. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming.

It doesnât matter much. 
All those mistakes we made. Weâre though now 
and we are leaving town tonight. 
Outside a broken dream, 
I feel unusual but safe there, 
like nothing can stop us now. 
So take my hand, weâll run forever âtill it ends.

Look what Iâve done now, youâre dying from love and youâre bleeding. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming. 
Look what Iâve donât now, Iâm sick of this town and Iâm leaving. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming.

Your sultry eyes, your common kiss, 
Iâm in disguise, it's something I miss. 
Your lipstick smears, Iâm feeling grey, 
with not much time to take me away. 
This city is far from here. 
Now turn back, turn back. Iâm scared, 
but in the bright lights we fade 
into the rearview mirror.

Look what Iâve done now, youâre dying from love and youâre bleeding. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming. 
Look what Iâve donât now, Iâm sick of this town and Iâm leaving. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? âcause Iâm dreaming. 

Look what Iâve done now, youâre dying from love and youâre bleeding
