Paralyzed by the beauty of those words
That so delicately drip from this angel of untamed lust
Suddenly I fear the end of my solitude
Once a warrior, poetic shrieks now own my soul

Left behind to fight the ruthless pawns of Eris
Hope will strike her down beneath the blade (as she sings for him)

Suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare
But he no longer fights the torture of her voice
So long forgotten, I am lost in her stare
Now made so clear as she extracts her painful toll
A soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens (He is hers)

Beautiful whispers leave one so fair
Chain these hands of ageless struggle
Rid us of this beloved curse
An epic tale of deceit is given life once more on silver lips so spiteful
Her tongue screams for him
Rid us of this curse

Suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare
But he no longer fights the torture of her voice
So long forgotten, I am lost in her stare
Now made so clear as she extracts her painful toll
A soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens (He is hers)

Set loose so long ago by the foolish whim of Pandora
Phantoms which shall forever prey on mankind's weakness
The grains of time hold no bearing to those eyes
In pale moonlight she sings to the haunted sea
Vile notes seduce old Cerberus to slake unholy thirst

Left behind to fight the ruthless pawns of Eris
Hope will strike her down beneath the blade (as she sings for him)

Suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare
But he no longer fights the torture of her voice
So long forgotten, I am lost in her stare
Now made so clear as she extracts her painful toll
A soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens (He is hers)
With the torture of the sirens
