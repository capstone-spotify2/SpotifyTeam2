I Just Saw Your Picture, From The Lost and Found
It Was Taken The Day We Met
With So Many People Around

All My False Bravado Seemed To Disappear
So I Just Had To Follow My Heart
I Knew It Would Take Me Somewhere

And I Still Feel The Same
But Its Hard To Explain
All My Emotions Are Tossed In The Wind
Lost Till The Moment I Hold You Again

When I Say I Want You
When I Say I Need You
When You Say Come Closer
I Know I'll Never Leave You

You Can Stare Into Heaven
When Your Heart IS Free
I Suppose That We Just Couldn't Wait
For Heaven Is Where We Must Be

And We Still Feel The Same
No Need To Explain
I Don't See The Shadows
I Don't Feel The Rain
I'm Walking In Sunlight
I'll Tell You Again

When I Say I Want You
When I Say I Need You
When You Say Come Closer
I Know I'll Never Leave You
When I Say I Want You
When I Say I Need You
When You Say Come Closer
I Know I'll Never Leave You
