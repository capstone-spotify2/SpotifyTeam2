It's quite simple when I'm listening
You keep leading me all the way home
These messages you've been offering
As a magical child
An essential child

It hinges on the driver's seat
It depends on who's in control
When I waver on the attuning
I kill a magical child
This essential child
Oh

To thine own self be true
To my core self be true

When direction is confounding
When vitality is far gone
When the spark is out, uninspiring
I call the magical child
The essential child
Oh

To thine own self be true
To my core self be true

When I'm lost and I'm unraveling
When I'm off my track and I float
When I need true north and some grounding
I call the magical child
The essential child
This angelic child
This innocent child

To thine own self be true
To my core self, be true

Angelic child
Innocent child
Magical child
Essential child
