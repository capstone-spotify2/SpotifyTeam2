Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you really, really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
