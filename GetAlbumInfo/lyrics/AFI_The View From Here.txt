So softly spoke the sky, tonight the city dies 
(You'll be safe alone)
And then he did confide, black flowers blooming lies 
(You'll be safe alone)
So softly I returned, a bow for all I've learned 
(You'll be safe alone)
I hung myself up high, where I watched it burn

I'm still alone
I'm still alone 
(You'll be safe alone)
I'm still alone

I know, this is, what you wanted
I'd go, just go away
I know, your heart, is my haunted
This ghost will fade away

(So softly spoke the sky, tonight the city dies)

I'm still alone
I'm still alone 
(You'll be safe alone)
I'm still alone
