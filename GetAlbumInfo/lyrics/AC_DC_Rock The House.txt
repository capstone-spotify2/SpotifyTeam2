Mistress, mistress all night long
Keep on coming hard and strong
Hot to the touch, hot to the taste
Oozin' out on my plate

I'm gonna yell out, she's gonna shout
She gonna push her all the way down
Gonna kick up her heels, make you scream
Rock on out baby, make you squeal

Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock
And let it roll

Hold on tight, she plays a tease
Squeeze you around, she aim to please
She gonna kick her legs high in the air
She gonna shake it down the hot, wet, wild fare

Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock
And let it roll

Look in my eyes, what do I see
Hot blooded woman just waiting for me
Gonna kick up her heels, make you scream
Rock on out baby, make you squeal

Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock
And let it roll

Rock the house
Rock, rock, rock
And let it roll

Let it roll
Rock the house down
Till the walls come down
