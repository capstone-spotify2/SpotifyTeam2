I am flat dead on my feet
I have had nothing to eat
I am sick of highways and cold hotels rooms
I have replay there in our soft bed
I am so tired of missing you

So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
And lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give me the lose that I need
Baby let's love some sleep tonight

All these shows that I play
Take me so far away
I know that I have negleated your needs
You have been tested and trialed
Stuck firm by my side
Waiting patiently for the man of your needs

So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
And lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give me the love that I need
Baby let's lose some sleep tonight

Sweetheart one night together
Is not nearly enough
We need the rest of forever making up for lost love

So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
Lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give you the love that you need
Let's lose some sleep tonight
The love that I need
Baby let's lose some sleep tonight
