Pour up some liquor chasinâ with the juice,
I came to party; what you came to do?
I got them Rose bottles by the bucket,
Grab ya dawg and tell him âFuck it, go all out or nothinââ.
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka,
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka,
Shout out to DJ in this muhfucka,
Bottles in the air, you ballinâ like a muhfuckaaaaaaa,

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Iâm fresh to death and they know this, hoppinâ out of that Beamer,
Fresh up out of that Neiman, Marcus rockinâ the meanest,
Fly shit with my fly bitch, ass phatter than Trina,
Pullinâ up to the club I swear my swagga on a seizure,
Make yo bitch Beat Bop the sneaker, she know where to meet us,
Bitch Iâm not a star, donât carry no VâGers,
Got them faces in my Leviâs, flyer than your G5âs,
Big money what I rely, you are just a peon,
And I bounce around, Iâm in focus,
Rose is all that we pourinâ, smoking all of that doja, standinâ on all them sofas,
Tear dat roof up off this muhfucka, man fuck it,
Club buckinâ in this muhfucka, you say you like it, huh?

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Everybody on liquor, homies rollinâ them swishers,
Everybody takinâ pictures, seen her friends but I like her sister,
Got that ass round and I need it, donât make me repeat it,
Swagginâ out of this world, confident, conceited,
Drinkinâ Rose after bottles, riiiiiiiight, and Iâm with them models,
Like Iâm âthicker than a Snickerâ type, thatâs what I like,
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka, hey mister DJ, bring it back off in this muhfuckaaaaaaaaa,
Yeah, so fuck who got a problem wit it,
Got me into my zone, I can handle my own, they not in my division,
Gotta pocket full of green, and a Ray Benz black with diamonds yellow, homie,
See ya money too small, sorry, you cannot join this ceremony.
