A thousand words for why I love you
Girl, I could go on all night telling you why it'll be true
Let's stretch out on my leather couch under our 18 by 22
I cannot try to explain it
Baby how can say it to you

Girl you're the rest of my life and all
And you come whenever I call
Girl I just wanna say it
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
That's why

Baby, what you are to me
No one else can be
Ooh, and I think I'm in love baby
Ooh ooh, baby just can't stop this feelin'
From taking over and over
And I know I can't stop it girl, you're mine
You're mine, yeah

I can understand how you want your space
Give it all some time to let it soak into your mind
Searching all my life for a woman like you
Gonna do exactly what my precious heart tells me to

Oh girl, you're the rest of my life and all
And you come whenever I call, girl
And baby I just wanna say it
I thank you from the bottom of my heart

Ooh, ooh, baby, what you are to me
No one else can be
Ooh, and I think I'm in love baby
Ooh ooh, baby just can't stop this feelin'
From taking over and over
And I know I can't stop it girl, you're mine

I know that you've been hurt before
By men who swear it all
But I just wanna say
Wanna take it day by day
I'm gonna pick you up whenever you
Pick you up whenever you fall
