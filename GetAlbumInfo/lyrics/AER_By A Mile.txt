Face it now, you chasin' now, fakin' what I do
Tracin' sounds, take imitation on my moves
You know how, you know how I can tell it's true
I pace it now, cause there's no other way I do

I love myself
More than you by a mile
And it's true you can tell
By the way that I don't have to try

I love myself
More than you by a mile
And it's true you can tell
By the way that I don't have to try

Say what you wanna, say what you gotta
I hear ya, but I'm not listening
Say what you wanna, say what you gotta
I hear ya, but I'm not listening

We don't see eye to eye, where's the need to compromise
Been bending rules you're abiding by
Don't make me blow up like dynamite
You've been treading too hard and it's gotta stop
And you're not dragging me down to the bottom rock
Don't hold your breath, once you're gone you're forgot
I hope cutting you off will be honest enough,
Your stone cold stare don't hold much weight in any part of this state no more
And I told you twice it's always been me deciding my own fate you know
And i won't bend over backwards, don't look back, might escape without a trace ya know
Try to keep your image clean but sooner or later you'll let go and those stain will show

Face it now, you chasin' now, fakin' what I do
Tracin' sounds, take imitation on my moves
You know how, you know how I can tell it's true
I pace it now, cause there's no other way I do

I love myself
More than you by a mile
And it's true you can tell
By the way that I don't have to try

I love myself
More than you by a mile
And it's true you can tell
By the way that I don't have to try

Say what you wanna, say what you gotta
I hear ya, but I'm not listening
Say what you wanna, say what you gotta
I hear ya, but I'm not listening

When did focusing on myself make me selfish
Just cuz I'm refusing to take your help doesn't make me helpless
Making me out to sound wrong in the story that you're tellin
My affection lies with these lines and these words got you jealous
I've been a heavy handed at times, cuz veni vidi vici
You treat a deep wound like a bee sting
You should've left the handcuffs back at the precinct
I'm an unshakable skyscraper, to hell with your reaching
Now lemme make this clear there's no shot here
I'll forever love this we only met last year
C'mon face that fear, let my face disappear
Stop waging war, takes a drop for the tears

Cool that you're mocking I'll never ever have the time
I'm just driven and what's given to me got me till I die
Lord knows I'm worth, I still got both feet on the ground
I'll be proving myself to you every day through my own style
