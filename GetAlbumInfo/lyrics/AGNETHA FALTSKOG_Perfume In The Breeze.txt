The beach is a lonely place
This time of year
The mongers and the tourists
And the children
Have all disappeared
I'm not sure what happened
But it happened so fast
People say love like this can never last
But, what a night
What a night
What a night
I'm still not alright

Oh, you vanished
Like a rainbow
From the horizon of my heart
Left me seaside like a homeless
I pushed my sorrows in the car
Oh, you vanished
Like a shadow
Into the darkness of the seas
Maybe next time, my sweet lover
I'll catch your perfume in the breeze

Flicking through channels on the TV set
To quiet my mind
Reality shows and the news replaces
The piece I can't find
I'm not sure what happened
But it happened so fast
People say love like this can never last
Fortune tellers
And tarot cards
Can't find the clues
Won't heal my scars

Oh, you vanished
Like a rainbow
From the horizon of my heart
Left me seaside like a homeless
I pushed my sorrows in the car
Oh, you vanished
Like a shadow
Into the darkness of the seas
Maybe next time, my sweet lover
I'll catch your perfume in the breeze

And you'll bring summer back again...

Oh, you vanished
Like a rainbow
From the horizon of my heart
Left me seaside like a homeless
I pushed my sorrows in the car
Oh, you vanished
Like a shadow
Into the darkness of the seas
Maybe next time, my sweet lover
I'll catch your perfume in the breeze
