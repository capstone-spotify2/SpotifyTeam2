I came back home and you said to me
I've come so far came so close to finding you
And your love will help me through
Your love will guide me to you
Even when I try to take control
Need your love, need your love
There's a riddle inside that I'll never know
Need your love, need your love

It's your love
You can do it, but you know it won't stop
Help me through
Looking at it from the bottom to the top
It's your love
You can do it, but you know it won't stop
It guides me to
Looking at it from the bottom to the top

After some time I recognized that it was for real
Real, real
You opened my eyes and I could not deny
How you make me feel
All of your ways, your ways

Your love
You can do it, but you know it won't stop
Looking at it from the bottom to the top now
You can do it, baby show me what you got
Gimme what you got now
It's your love
You can do it, but you know it won't stop
Help me, you help me to get through
Looking at it from the bottom to the top now
It's your love
It guides me, it guides me back to you
You can do it, but you know it won't stop
You
