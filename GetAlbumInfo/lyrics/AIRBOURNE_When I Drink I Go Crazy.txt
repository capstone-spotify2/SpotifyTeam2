Crazy!

I've had a long, long day, so tonight I need a drink
Don't ask why, I don't wanna think
'Cause tonight is ours, so we wanna drink some more
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us out the door

I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy, I can't think
I go crazy, crazy when I drink

Standing drunk in the middle of the road
Directing traffic like a ninja
All my mates are screaming "hurry up"
We're all here, drinking in the pub

I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy, I can't think
I go crazy, crazy when I drink
I go crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm crazy, oh, going crazy

I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy, going crazy, going crazy, crazy, yeah

I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy, I can't think
I go crazy, crazy when I drink

I go out of my mind
But I feel so alive
I need more, I need more
To keep me going
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah

I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy when I drink
I go crazy, I can't think
I go crazy, crazy, fucking crazy

I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
I go crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Crazy!
