Oh I'm blessed and I know I am
God has dealt me a winning hand
A loving woman and a fairy land for me

Oh and I can't believe it half the time
When I look at her in perfect light
Sweet vision every day and night I see

<i>[Chorus]</i>
My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes

Oh and I'm never very far away
Even if I'm in another place
Her smile you can't erase from me

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Oh and I'm thankful every waking hour
For the love of a gentle flower
A face I will never tire or leave

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
