Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
A so-called country singer, there singing on MTV
And I began to think - had she ever heard a thing
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Ah - ha

From the Houston rodeo to any old dancehall
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Cause I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it

Aw yeah...

All together now....

It's a Texas thing, Y'all
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Cause when it comes to country, there ain't none like 
I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it

That hip-hoppin' rappin' boy band crap is for the squirrels in San Francisco
And Nashville is making music that sounds like a dadgum disco
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Yes, I said don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That's right...
