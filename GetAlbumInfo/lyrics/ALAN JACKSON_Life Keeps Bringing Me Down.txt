I'm the poorest old boy that you will ever see
Life keeps bringing me down
Whenever I'm trying living above my means,
Life keeps bringing me down.

Yeah, life keeps bringing me down
Blues keep coming around
Hard living's gonna be the death of me,
Life keeps bringing me down.

When the Clouds roll in and the sun won't shine
Life keeps bringing me down
Now my dollar bills ain't worth a dime
Life keeps bringing me down

Yeah, life keeps bringing me down
Big tears drops hitting the ground
Well, it won't stop raining on this heart of mine
Life keeps bringing me down.

Yeah, I hate to wake up when the morning comes,
Life keeps bringing me down
But I drank a pot of coffee and I'm on the run
Life keeps bringing me down.

Yeah, life keeps bringing me down,
The world keeps spinning around.
Yeah that old rat race it ain't no fun
Life keeps bringing me down.

I've got a mountain of debt to crawl out from under
Life keeps bringing me down
But one of these days I'm gonna hit the numbers,
Life keeps bringing me down.

Yeah, life keeps bringing me down,
I'm all ground down to the bottom of the ground
Yeah, it's been a bummer the whole damn summer,
Life keeps bringing me down.
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down.
