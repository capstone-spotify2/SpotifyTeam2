I was watching the news tonight
Anchorman said there was a fight
And a young man died from his wounds
They showed pictures of the battle
And I almost turned the channel
Like I always seem to do
Then it hit me like a freight train coming through

Thatâs somebodyâs son,
Somebodyâs husband,
Somebodyâs everything,
Out there someoneâs coming undone
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebodyâs son

I walked down the hall to check
On my youngest lying in bed
And I stood there watching him dream
I tried but I couldnât imagine how we would feel if something happened
And I didnât have him here with me
Then I cried for that dead boy and his family

Heâs somebodyâs son,
Somebodyâs husband,
Somebodyâs everything,
Out there someoneâs coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
Heâs somebodyâs son

Somebodyâs son,
Somebodyâs husband,
Somebodyâs everything.
Out there someoneâs coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody's son
