Step by step I'll follow you
Everywhere you roam, whoa
Step by step I'll follow through
Comin' to bring you home, whoa

I keep reachin' out for you
Wondering if I'm touchin' you
You say "Yeah"
But when it's on the line
you are nearly mine
Then you're off and gone
again, ooh

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Lady be kind,
lady be mine
Lady divine,
I adore you
Give me a sign,
where is it goin' to
Will of the wisp,
maid of the mist
Forever and ever
waitin' for you
My name on a list
I never did this till you

Step by step I'm keepin' time
Lady it's runnin' low, whoa
Step by step just makin' time
And I want to make it grow,
whoa

There's a diamond in the sun
There's somebody for everyone
There's a movie that you know
that makes you smile
Love ain't everything
But girl we should try it
for a while

<i>[Chorus]</i>

My father told me it's okay
to be lonely
Just don't be taken for the fool
I sit here waitin' anticipatin'
I think I broke my daddy's rule

Let go and let it be 'cause
I can't bear to see
us lose the best we ever had

<i>[Chorus]</i>
