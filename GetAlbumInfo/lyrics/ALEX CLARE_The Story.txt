Take the times where I just fall
Change it back when I was lying on the floor
Maybe that's a sacrifice called forth
Let it give a better than I ever worked for <i>[?]</i>

But your story isn't over
No, I only just begun
You know sometimes it's hard to understand
The road we're on, the road we're on

Wear my biggest down to the phone
Gave you everything, my mind, my heart, my soul
If you didn't seen or hide it in my hearts
You know that I can never compromise <i>[?]</i>

But your story isn't over
No, I only just begun
You know sometimes it's hard to understand
The road we're on, the road we're on

The story's just beginning
I can feel the rising sun
You know sometimes it's hard to comprehend
The road we're on, the road we're on, yeah

When you're at your end
And the road's still on
You know a broken bone
Grows back twice as strong
Yeah, grows back twice as strong

You know sometimes it's hard to understand
The road we're on, the road we're on
The story's just beginning
I can feel the rising sun
You know sometimes it's hard to understand
The road we're on, the road we're on
