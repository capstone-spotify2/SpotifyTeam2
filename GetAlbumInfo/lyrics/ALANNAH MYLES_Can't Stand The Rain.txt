Can't stand the rain... against my window...
Bringing back sweet memories... 
There were no pain... Tell me do you remember, Mmmm...
How sweet it used to be...

When we was together... 
Everything was so grand, 
Now that we've parted... 
There's one sound,
That I just can't stand, 

I can't stand the rain... against my window...
Bringing back sweet memories...
Can't stand the rain... Against my, win..dow...
Cause you're not here with me...

Woah with the pillow...
Where... his head used to lay
I know you got some sweet... memories...
But like the, but like the, the window,
You ain't got nothing to say...

Can't stand the rain... against my window...
Bringing back sweet memories...
I can't stand the rain... against my win-dow pane... 
Cause he's not here with me..

Go away rain... I can't stand the rain
Come again another day...
