Sometimes you are
a one way mirror
I can't see through
but know you're watching.
You're in that place,
I reach and hear you
And I can feel the storm is building

You rain again,
inside yourself
so no one hears
your cries for help.
You rain again,
behind your eyes
but I can be your sun
when you rain.

I know you try
I know you love me
But when it gets too overwhelming

You rain again,
inside yourself
so no one hears
your cries for help.
You rain again,
behind your eyes
but I can be your sun
when you rain.

Against the windows of your heart, (Oh, you rain)
you beat and tear yourself apart. (Oh, you rain)
You pour your soul onto the ground,
until you're spilling your pride out.

You rain again,
inside yourself
so no one hears
your cries for help.
You rain again,
behind your eyes
but I can be your sun
when you rain.

Against the windows of your heart,
you beat and tear yourself apart.
You pour your soul onto the ground,
until you're spilling your pride out.
You rain again inside yourself,
so no one hears your cries for help.
You rain again behind your eyes,
but I can be your sun
when you rain.
