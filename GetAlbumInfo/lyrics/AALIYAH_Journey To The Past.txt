Heart, don't fail me now!
Courage, don't desert me!
Don't turn back now that we're here
People always say
Life is full of choices
No one ever mentions fear!
Or how a road can seem so long
How the world can seem so vast

Courage, see me through
Heart, I'm trusting you
On this journey to the past

Somewhere down this road
I know someone's waiting
Years of dreams
Just can't be wrong
Arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
Finally home where I belong
Well, starting here, my life begins
Starting now, I'm learning fast

Courage, see me through
Heart, I'm trusting you
On this journey to the past

Heart, don't fail me now!
Courage, don't desert me!

Home, love, family
There was once a time
I must have had them too
Home, love, family
I will never be complete
Until I find you.

One step at a time
One hope, then another
Who knows where this road may go.
Back to who I was
On to find my future
Things my heart still needs to know

Yes, let this be a sign!
Let this road be mine!
Let it lead me to my past

Courage, see me through
Heart, I'm trusting you
To bring me home at last!

At last!
