uh
uh c'mon
watch out
uh c'mon
oh oh.....

Gave you chances on top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted
My reality is all your exshalities
Cause insanity 
Why you askin'me?
Took my kindness for a sign of weakness
My own blindness cause my sadness
No longer am a slave over your madness
I am glad it's finally over

Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy

See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name
See your qualities are less than pleasing
I got more than one reason for leaving
It's time to close shop, open new chapters
See new beginnings is what I'm after
Get your skeletons up out my closet
Don't make me lose it, I just might lose it

Who do you think you are now? (Yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Can't believe)
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah yeah)

That you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya to you've left
Cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that I'm here all by myself
