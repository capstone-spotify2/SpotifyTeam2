You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So darling feel like I feel
And I don't have to know if it's real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Bada...

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found this day
So let me love you baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Bada...

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found this day
So let me love you baby
Let me love you
