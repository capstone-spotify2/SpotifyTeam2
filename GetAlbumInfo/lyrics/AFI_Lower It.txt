An invitation excluding no one,
so you walk right in and destroy the fucking place.
you've lost your right to be part of my family.
the family that welcomed you, you joined, and left in disgrace.
your flag was flaming (was flaming), your flag was flaming before it ever started flying.
your flag was burning, was burning down everyone in true salute.
sense of commitment.  A sense of pride.
i heard you say that we shared a destiny.
now it is plain to see you've got no sense at all.
the name that once honored you disgraced and made a mockery.
your flag was flaming (was flaming), your flag was flaming before it ever started flying.
your flag was burning, was burning down everyone in true salute.
i could always see... i could always see the smoke from miles away.
i could always see the weakness in your eyes.
far away i feel the lies while the sky is burning.
your flag was flaming (was flaming), your flag was flaming before it ever started flying.
your flag was burning, was burning down everyone in true salute.
you will always be unwanted... unwanted.
you will always be unwanted... unwanted... unwanted.
