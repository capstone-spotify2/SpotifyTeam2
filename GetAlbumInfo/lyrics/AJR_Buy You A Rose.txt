I been out walking
By the shore
The air was still
And still the water cold
And I want you to know
I'm thinking of you

This kind of chill
It helps me cope
I was so young to leave you all alone
And I want you to know
I'm thinking of you

All the pretty girls they find
A way to keep you on my mind
I swear I heard you singing along
Cities pass like into stars
And you're the one I'm looking for
It's so wrong
I didn't know until you were gone

Tell me, my love, you're ready to go?
Don't leave me all on my own
Cause I'm just a boy
Who's telling a girl
That when I grow up
I'll buy you a rose
When I grow up
I'll buy you a rose

And now I'm walking in the rain
I couldn't lie cause I was so afraid
And I want you to say
You're thinking of me

All the pretty girls they find
A way to keep you on my mind
I swear I heard you singing along
Cities pass like into stars
And you're the one I'm looking for
It's so wrong (It's so wrong)
I didn't know until you were gone

Tell me, my love, you're ready to go?
Don't leave me all on my own
And so
I'm just a boy
Who's telling a girl
That when I grow up
I'll buy you a rose

Baby tell me that you love me so
Can you let me know?
Can you hold me close?
(Hold me close)
Baby tell me you'll forgive me now
Cause I don't know how I can let you down

Hey, Hey, Heeeeey

Tell me, my love, you're ready to go?
Don't leave me all on my own
And so
I'm just a boy
Who's telling a girl
That when I grow up
I'll buy you a rose
(I'm gonna buy you a rose Yeah)
