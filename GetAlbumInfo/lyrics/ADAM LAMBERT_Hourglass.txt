Are we ready right now? 
I don't know somehow 
It feels so right 
It's time for our flight 
How will we know? 
When to go 
How will we find? 
All the time 
All the time 

Check for pre-flight 
The engines on 
Head on 
Into the sun 
No more good-byes 
This is for life 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 

Through the Hourglass we slide 
Searching for the moment to decide 
So I will stand tall 
Discover it all 
I will stand tall 
Where you are aloused 
So don't lose sight of me now 

After all this time 
We're still able to shine 
You rode from the stars 
Straight from the heart 

Check for pre-flight 
The engines on 
Head on 
Into the sun 
No more good-byes 
This is for life 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 
(this is for life) 

Through the Hourglass we slide 
Searching for the moment to decide 
So I will stand tall 
Discover it all 
I will stand tall 
Where you are aloused 
I won't lose sight of you now 
Oh, it's time 
(take my hand) 
(take my hand) 
(take my hand) 
And I tell 
Longer since 

Out here in space 
It seems so clear
