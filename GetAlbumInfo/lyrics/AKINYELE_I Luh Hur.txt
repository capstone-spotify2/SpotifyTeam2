My girl is pregnant, I'm ready to start splitting 
All around the town on the down low was the girl that I was hitting 
Everyone knows I used to luh huh 
I don't want this pregnant talk to get back to my mother 
Shit! I just can't believe it 
I thought me and this lady had came to a mutual agreement 
But I was dead wrong, her trick was evil and ill 
All along girlfriend I though you was still on the pill 
Step to the G-Y-N 
The gynecologist, miss, so we can put this to an END 
You'll need some dough, I'll probably LEND 
You wanna play Biz Mark AGAIN 
And tell him I'm just a FRIEND 
So buy me Newports, cause as I smoke 
All I do is think about you and child support 
But I don't got papes, I got money 
Sticking up and messing up when I went outta state 
So you can stop all that FIENDIN' 
With your damn SCHEMIN' 
You're Christopher Williams cause you must be DREAMIN' 
Wake up and escape 
And while you're at it why don't you throw away your Jodeci tapes 
Cause you can be forever my lady, but I ain't with no baby 
Ah, ah, no ifs ands or maybes 
I ain't old enough and ain't trying to hear it 
So don't steal my youth cause I'm still young in spirit 
That belly blows up, it's gonna be trouble 
Imma have to play like a pin and come pop that bubble 
Find Chucky if you want child's play 
I'll give your ass a hanging and drop you off in an alleyway 
This is a diary of a black man 
By making no alimony payments due to no wedding bands 
So ax that talk about MARRAGE 
Miss, you must of misunderstood, I want you to have a MISCARRAGE 
I'm fed up, and sorry that I've done it 
I'm ready to set her up and have my little man kick her in the stomach 
Or punch my fist through that naval 
Cause I'll be damned if this be the hand that rocks the cradle 
Or push her down a flight of steps 
I don't care or give a heck 
About the people under the stairs 
I'm all about a home made ABORTMENT 
My name's not Pat, so don't send Jack Black 
This ain't the damn Wheel of FORTUNE 
I don't want no pause or no PORTION 
Next time woman you should proceed with CAUTION 
It ain't all about boy and girl 
A half hour past the Cosby Show 
Cause you, it's a whole different world 
And yom that's how live I am 
Use a diaphragm, I get it off your chest like a mammogram 
Oh brother, word to mother 
Just cause I talk this shit don't get me wrong 
Yo, I still luh hur 

I luh hur <i>[x5]</i> 

Nobody tell her, because I luh hur 

I luh hur <i>[x8]</i>
