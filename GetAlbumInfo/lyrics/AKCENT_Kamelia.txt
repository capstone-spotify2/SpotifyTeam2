She can take you everywhere,
Has a mood of billionaire,
Something special in the air when she's around,
She's the devil in disguise,
If you dare to look her eyes
She would trap you like a prize again and again.

Oh oh oh, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love
Oh oh oh, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love

What's up, baby girl? Don't mean you interrupt,
Just want a little minute, she said "OK, what's up? ",
I seen you across the bar, just sipping on your drink,
No ring on the finger, what I'm supposed to think?!,
That you're single girl, well I'm a single guy,
And by the smile on your face, says "I'm right",
I wanna hold you up like the water,
You know I like the pond, girl, you're my swan.

Oh oh oh, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love
Oh oh oh, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love

She's the lady, wanna get her,
She's my lady, Kamelia!
