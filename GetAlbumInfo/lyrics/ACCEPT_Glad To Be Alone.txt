I don't like your fucked up bunch
Of gentle fellows, my dear
I don't like the stupid people
With their well brushed hair

I don't like your well-dresses friends
With the talk about their problems
With that kind of small talk
Theyl feel good - but they are fools

I don't like to sit beside you
In your brand-new car
I don't like to show you need
Every day and night

You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again

Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone

If you have to work for nothing
Or some punds a day
Tears and sweat I had in future
Not much more to live

You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again

Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
