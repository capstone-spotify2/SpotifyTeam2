Well we're back and I'm on the loose
Hit me, hear me, feel the juice
She eye you up, she eye you down
Make you, make you stand up proud

Miss adventure, hot surprise
Bare essential, yeah that's nice
Miss adventure, feelin' real
Confidential, lips are sealed

Watch out boy, the cat's got your tongue
Feelin' like some hot cross buns
Love you, love you all the night
Make you, make you nice and tight

Miss adventure, hot surprise
Bare essential, yeah that's nice
Miss adventure, feelin' real
Confidential, lips are sealed

Miss adventure
Miss adventure
Yeah, that's nice
Feelin' real
Come on

Miss adventure
Bare essential
Miss adventure
Confidential

Miss adventure
Miss adventure
Miss adventure
Feelin' real
