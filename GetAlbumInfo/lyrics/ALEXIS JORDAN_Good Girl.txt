I like tight jeans, dark shades,
When I walk the ground shakes (boom)
Like an 808 (boom)
You appreciate my lean
Body nice shape,
Wanna take me on a date (move)
You've got what it takes (move)
You better have some cake.

I like, how I'm catching your eyes,
I like, how I don't even try,
I like you, I like you boy,
I like you, boy.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You might mistake me for heart breaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me,
Never seen before,
Might mistake me for a heart breaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I know you're shaking me,
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door.

I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.

I chew bubble gum and talk fast,
Switch up to high class (grooves)
On my day to day (grooves)
On these 28's,
My... hydraulics bump hard
But I can't kiss a car. (lose)
If you walk away (lose)
This could be your day

I like, how I'm catching your eyes,
I like, how I don't even even try,
I like you, I like you boy,
I like you, boy.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You might mistake me for heartbreaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me,
Never seen before,
Might mistake me for a heartbreaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I know you're shaking me,
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door.

I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before. <i>[x5]</i>
