Love comes to everyone
Some are weak, some strong
I'm not strong today
They've took her back
Brought the curtain down
What can I do now
I'm afraid
I'm afraid to think about it

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
What a life
It gets better as it goes along
What a life
It gets better as it goes along

I've been in love
Been left standing
Till I say is that what I want
Oh no there's got to be another smile on my face

I don't care about the money I make
Or what it can do
I'm alive and that's what's important to me

I don't need someone to tell me you'll get along
Who to please, who to watch over me

<i>[Chorus]</i>

There's an old man
Been calling me for a long time
Never able to get his face off my mind

He always said to me take it easy, take it easy
And all the things you want will come easy
Take it easy
What a life
What a life

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

He always said to me take it easy, take it easy
And all the things you want will come easy
Take it easy
What a life
What a life

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
