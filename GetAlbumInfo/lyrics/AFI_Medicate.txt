Oh!

Could I, could I just find a way?
I'd find you everyday and we could alter time.
But I've come to find everyone's gone away.
So this may be the time for the perfect crime.
Yes, this is perfect.

(This is) our medicine. (This is) our time to...

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in this and ignore
that you don't even know my name. Medicate.

Come day, you'll say you cannot stay.
What's more, I'll feel the same. It happens every time.
So I've come to find everyone goes away. I'm destined to remain.
You were never mine, so you were perfect.

(This is) our medicine. (This is) our time to...

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in this and ignore
that you don't even know my name.

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in us and ignore
that you don't even know my name. Medicate.

Can you describe what it's like? I feel nothing.
Can you feel this? Does it sting?

I feel nothing at all.
I feel nothing at all.
I feel nothing at all.

(Can you tell me how it feels?)
I feel nothing at all.
(Can we pretend this is real?)
I feel nothing.

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in this and ignore
that you don't even know my name.

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in us and ignore
that you don't even know my name.

Medicate here with me.
Now as we lose ourselves in us and ignore
that you don't even know my name.

Oh!

You don't even know my name.
You don't even know my name.

Oh! Medicate.
