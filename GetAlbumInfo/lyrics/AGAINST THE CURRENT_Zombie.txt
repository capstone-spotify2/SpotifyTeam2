One, two, three, four

I hope you know that I'm trying
To build a life that I can love
I hope I never stop dreaming
I need something I believe in

I dip this world in black and white
Monochrome igniting
I'm gonna be a neon sign
Let the ship rest cause I'm lighting up the city

I don't ever wanna wake up wondering
Where the years have gone
Not gonna be another sell out zombie
Wondering what went wrong
I'll never give in
I'll never back down
I'll never be another zombie in a life that's not my own

I don't wanna be nothing, no
There's nothing that scares me more
To live a life without meaning
Where I'm screaming
Behind close doors

I dip this world in black and white
Monochrome igniting
And I'm gonna be the brightest light
That anyone has ever seen
Dare you to look at me

I don't ever wanna wake up wondering
Where the years have gone
Not gonna be another sell out zombie
Wondering what went wrong
I'll never give in
I'll never back down
I'll never be another zombie in a life that's not my own

Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie, zombie

Please don't ever let me be
Another one of those de-e-ad zombies

Zombie, zombie, yeah

I don't ever wanna wake up wondering
Where the years have gone
Not gonna be another sell out zombie
Wondering what went wrong
I'll never give in
I'll never back down
I'll never be another zombie in a life that's not my own

Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie, zombie
