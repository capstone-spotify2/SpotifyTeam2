River's strong you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright
You could drive with your headlights out
âCause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

Girl you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catching on
Like a wildfire

Don't get up just to get another
You can drink from mine
We can't leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you want to get older with me
âCause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

Girl you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catching on
Like a wildfire

Girl you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catching on
Like a wildfire

Girl you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line
Get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catching on
Like a wildfire
