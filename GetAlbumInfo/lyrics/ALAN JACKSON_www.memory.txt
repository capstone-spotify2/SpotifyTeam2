I know your leavin' I see the signs 
Your gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me, you'll never write
You made your mind up and your gone tonite
If some rainy day your all alone
And feel like talkin' you can log me on.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
At www dot memory 
I'll be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me. 
At www dot memory.

You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me 
Through your keyboard and wires
Though you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
At www dot memory 
I'll be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me. 
At www dot memory.

If you feel the need just click on me. 
At www dot memory...
