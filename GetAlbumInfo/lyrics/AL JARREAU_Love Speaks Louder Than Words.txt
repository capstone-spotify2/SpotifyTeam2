You and I stalkin' each other
Beatin' around the bush
You and I stuck in the weather
Somebody needs a push
Every time you decide
That the time isn't right
Every time that you hide
From your feelings your loneliness wins

Let love begin
Let the magic happen
Give me half a chance

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I'll hold you now
I'll show you now
I'll give you all of my love
Speaks louder that words
Let this love keep talkin'
I'll hold you now
I'll show you how
I'll give you all of my love
Speaks louder than words
Please let me in
Let this love begin

Every time you make a promise
I've been the one who waits
Only time's keepin' it from us
Love never comes too late
As I live and I breathe
You will someday believe
I'm the one that you need,
Let your feelings forget where you've been

Let love begin
Let the magic happen
Give me half a chance

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
