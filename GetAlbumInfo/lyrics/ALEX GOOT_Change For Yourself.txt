You should have called me
I would have tried to get you through the night
The snow is falling
And I donât mean the weather thatâs outside
You lied to me right to my face
You always told me
How to deal with a life of stress
But now as I take a look at you
You look like a mess

Did you fall out of sync with your mind?
Did you lose yourself tonight?

Take control of your life somehow
Before its too late
Youâve got some things to figure out
Itâs time to make a change for yourself

Overwhelming
Nothing less
Did you make it up?
Iâm in denial
Canât you tell the way this makes me feel?

Did you fall out of sync with your mind?
Did you lose yourself tonight?

Take control of your life somehow
Before its too late
Youâve got some things to figure out
Itâs time to make a change for yourself
Its not too late
Its never too late

You can call me
Any time you need me

Take control of your life somehow
Before its too late
Youâve got some things to figure out
Itâs time to make a change for yourself
