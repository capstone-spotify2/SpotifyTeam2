Keep it 100, Iâm countin this money, they know what it be
Couple them diamonds, them bitches be shinin, they know that itâs me
Niggas be sleep til I hop on the beat and they wake up the beast
Fuck what you talkin, donât like what you say then them choppas can speak
Bang! Bang! Chief Keef voice nigga (nigga)
Come through the hood in the Roll Royce, Ghost nigga
Hallelujah (praise God), hallelujah (praise God)
Thank the jeweler, he precare and send a mule
Rockin so much ice Iâm like a walkin cooler

Fresh on the molly, get money my hobby, you got it, capish
Oh God, oh God, not talkin Big Sean but I give her the D!
Pull up the 2 seater, Iâm ballin Lou Kima like Adrian P
Clique full of real niggas
Walk in the club with yo bitch and I bet that I still get er
Real shit, paranoid I keep a full clip
Woke up this morning, Iâm counting this money, Iâm out of my mind Iâm just tryina survive
Got to go get it, no need to decide
Benjamin Franklins all in my eyes
Some people round have the devil inside
Stick with my niggas, we never divide, no!
âCause I donât really trust niggas
Just might say a prayer for you fuck niggas
