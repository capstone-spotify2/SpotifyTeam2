You don't know it what he'd been through
Walk a mile in his shoes
And I'm sure you'd break down in the end
He's at heartbreaks, he's at sitbacks
Lost it all, got it all back
And he's had it time and time and time again

Sure you'd understand
What's a modern broken glass
'Cause so deep he, 'cause so deep he

Said that he's basic
But you don't really know what it means
Feeling kind of wasted and used
He's half crazy from the madness that you do
And I'm picking the little pieces overdue

He's got heart, he got substance
He good time, no judgments
And he's trying to be the best that he can be
Throw right here ma in a sentence
Articulate, try to make sense
I would call that's become a part of you
That's the roman's road
He can wind up infidel
That's the first time that you noticed that
The thing that happened

Said that he's basic
But you don't really know what it means
Feeling kind of wasted and used
He's half crazy from the madness that you do
And I'm picking the little pieces overdue

Said that he's basic
But you don't really know what it means
Feeling kind of wasted and used
He's half crazy from the madness that you do
And I'm picking the little pieces overdue
