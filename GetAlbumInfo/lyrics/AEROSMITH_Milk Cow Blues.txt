Well I tried everything
Just to get along with you
And I'm gonna tell you just
What I'm gonna do

Well I'm sick of all your cryin
When you should be leavin me alone
If you don't believe me
You pack my bag, I'm gone

Won'tcha please
A don't that sun look good goin' down
You almost lost your love girl
When your ol' man ain't around

Won'tcha please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
Well you best believe that I love ya baby
When your ol man ain't around

New dance!

Go!

Won'tcha you please
Don't that sun (sun) look (look) good (good) goin' down
Won't you please....woo
Don't that sun look good goin' down
Well you best believe that I love ya baby
When your ol' man ain't around

And around and around and
around and around and
around and round and
round and round and
round and round...yak yak yak yak ya...
