Hide me from the glitter
The part of me that can't dissolve
'Cause I don't wanna feel bitter
And taste it deep within my soul

I'm just a girl who dreams of singing
Who wants the adulation most
What am I trying to conform to?
Why am I making friends with ghosts?

Been chasing a ghost that doesn't exist
It's haunting my soul, I'm scared and alone
Been running away, no way to resolve
How did I get here? How can I get home?

Sometimes I drift away, I melt into another place
It's a fraction of my mind and no it doesn't need a face
I meditate, I find the light, put the wrong I've done to right
It is part of giving time to get the best I can in life

Been chasing a ghost that doesn't exist
It's haunting my soul, I'm scared and alone
Been running away, no way to resolve
How did I get here? How can I get home?

Fly over me, make it clear, help me see
No more turning back now 'cause I'm where I should be
No longer I'm lost in a dark fantasy
I followed on and I carried on now

Help me believe that the things that I need
Are high up with you, so much bigger than me
The story is written before I could breathe
Stay here beside me, help me to see

Been chasing a ghost that doesn't exist
It's haunting my soul, I'm scared and alone
Been running away, no way to resolve
How did I get here? How can I get home?

Been chasing a ghost that doesn't exist
It's haunting my soul, I'm scared and alone
Been running away, no way to resolve
How did I get here? How can I get home?
How can I get, how can I get, how can I get home?
