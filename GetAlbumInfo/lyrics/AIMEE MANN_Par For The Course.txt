It's par for the course
You bet the wrong horse
You put down the phone and cried
For yourself
And for what
You couldn't have

A plea
That won't do
Now that she
Serves it to you

And I don't even know you
I don't even know you anymore
I don't even know you
I don't even know you

It's all you deserve
The loss of the nerve
The grade of the curve
Has brought you to this
By the boat that you missed
You clung to the raft
So she swerved out of your path

And I don't even know you
I don't even know you anymore
I don't even know you anymore

You loved her a lot
But she lost the plot
And timing is everything
In this game
So let's have
A moment of blame

Think how
It could have been
Well you should
Have said it all then

And I don't even know you
I don't even know you anymore
I don't even know you anymore

I don't even know you anymore
I don't even know you anymore
