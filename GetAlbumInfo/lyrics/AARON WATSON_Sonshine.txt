When wilted and whithered
And dyin' of thirst
In need of forgiveness
When you're at your worst
Let the rain fall upon you
Like sweet mornin' dew
Wash away all your sorrows
And let the Son shine on you

Let the Son shine from heaven
Through the clouds in the sky
Come receive your salvation
From His sacrifice
And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
You turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you

I've been there before
And I know your pain
Surrounded by darkness
All alone and ashamed
While you're out on life's highway
The wrong turn can leave you lost
So when you come to the crossroad
Take the road to the cross

Let the Son shine from heaven
Through the clouds in the sky
Come receive your salvation
From His sacrifice
And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
Turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you

And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
You turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you

Turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you
