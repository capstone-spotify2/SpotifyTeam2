I've been searching for the time spent
Another day of mine went
Dwelling in my mind when
Ultimately life's just 
Tangles in a paintbrush
I'll never be a saint but
I can't catch the day with wishes

Thinking never gets me
Any closer to your heart

I won't stop 'till I know this is over
I won't die unsure of what we had
I'm not done 'till I know I have shown ya'
I've done all I can

Tonight my city lights are shining 
But I find I'm resigned in
Working through my past
The nights are fading fast
Now push out all this noise
And focus on one voice
Then I would have a place
To start from

Thinking hasn't fed me
Nor's it kept me safe from harm

I won't stop 'till I know this is over
I won't die unsure of what we had
I'm not done 'till I know I have show ya'
I've done all I can

We might be two opposing magnets
Pushing ourselves backwards
But when you're in my arms
I know I'm safe from harm
I'm better than I was 
I'm writing every verse
To ponder what I'm worth
Without you

Thinking won't correct me
Or erase my failures past

I won't stop 'till I know this is over
I won't die unsure of what we had
I'm not done 'till I know I have show ya'
I've done all I can

I won't stop 'till I know this is over
I won't die unsure of what we had
I'm not done 'till I know I have show ya'
I've done all I can
