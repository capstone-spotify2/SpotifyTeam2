I thought I'd drop a line
Just saying
How your song's
Been playing
A pretty pitter patter
It lightly played
The summer rain
Upon my face

Like polka dots and ballerinas
You floated right between us
With gossamer and feathers
You fanned the flames
In (like) portraits caught
In autumn rain

Around and round
Upside-down
Are you just out for air
Or maybe somewhere hiding
Playing 'round the corner

Somewhere I read a line
Just praising
A book and a song
And how the world was brighter
When Betty came along

Around and round
Upside-down
Are you just out for air
Or maybe somewhere hiding
Playing 'round the corner

Somewhere I read a line
Just praising
A book and a song
And how the world was brighter
When Betty came along

This world was brighter
'Cause Betty came along
