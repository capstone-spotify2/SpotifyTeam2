Stuck here for the weekend 
Kickin on a tin-can, out of my mind 
Stuck here for indefinite 
Talking to myself, half of the time 
Stone cold black'n'blue 
My memories of you 
Got no future got no plans 
Without a clue 
What to do 

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
When you lose your love in a dead end town 
And there's no place else to go 
When the rumours runnin' around and around 
And the days go by so slow 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I had a feeling 
I had a feeling once 
Until someone took it away 

Until someone took it away (oh yeah) 

Stuck here for the weekend 
Looking at too much time to kill 
Luck has never found a home 
In this not so Pleasantville 
Stone cold black'n'blue 
You tore me up in two 
There's no way out and no way back 
Without a clue 
What to do 

<i>[Pre-chorus]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Until someone took it away (oh-oh-oh...) 

All this time I 
preyed for someone else to 
come my way and 
sweap me off my feet (yeah) 
All this time I 
wasted in this dreadful 
lonely place that 
I once called my home 
(All this time) 

<i>[Pre-chorus (x2)]</i>

<i>[Chorus (x3 impro/variation)]</i>
