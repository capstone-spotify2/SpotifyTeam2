Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'm me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me,
"It's no better to be safe than sorry."

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say, yeahâ
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
