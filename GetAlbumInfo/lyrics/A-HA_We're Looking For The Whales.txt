One left low left two who left high
They seem so hard to find
Three came twice took once the time
To search...
We're looking for a little bewildered girl
We're looking for a little bewildered girl
We're looking for the whales

Restlessness is in our genes
Time won't wear it off
Born into this world with our eyes 
wide open

Girl
We're looking for a little bewildered girl
We're looking for a little bewildered girl
We're looking for the whales

I found angels
Beached outside your doors
Don't you set those lonely eyes on me
We're looking for the whales
We're looking for the whales...
