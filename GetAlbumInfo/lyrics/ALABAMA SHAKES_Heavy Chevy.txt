He asked me not to go so fast
Slow your road down babe
He said he got him a little girl
She ain't no cruiser like I am
Well you know she ain't the one
You got to run boy run

Now why you wanna do it dirty?
If it was me, how could ya hurt me?
Oh baby, please please please
How could you keep me down here on my knees
Well you know she ain't the one
You got to run boy run

<i>[Shouting]</i>

Ooh, ooh daddy ooh
You know my heart's not outta room
You wanna love that little girl
By all means, honey do
Well you know she ain't the one

He said now lemme take ya out
Buy you new appliances
I wanna take ya out
Better home <i>[?]</i>
I wanna take ya out
I wanna meet ya kids
I wanna take you home baby
Tell me where it is
I come back when I want and
Don't you ask no questions
Me and you forever baby
We could be together babe
I love ya babe!
And no I really do
I wanna take ya out
And take ya kids out too
I wonder if you'll let me
We're stuck in the heavy Chevy
I wonder if you'll let me
Baby baby do ya get me
I wonder if you'll ever
Eh-eh-eh-ever be jealous
I wanna be with you together baby
You and me throughout eternity!
