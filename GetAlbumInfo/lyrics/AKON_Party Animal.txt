If you sexy and you know it clap your hands
If you sexy and you know it clap your hands
If you sexy and you know it take your wait and break to show it
Get on the dancefloor and dance

Tonight is the night
Where everything changes like the weather
Cause I plan a fly, so high
Like them dollar bills when they makin it rain
And I lie, get by
Me and my ladys in the club they showing how
Feeling so right
Fellas are all on me
Cause it's your night and I'm glad that you're came

All you problems will travel to the other side
Free your mind and all of your pain and struggle
We gon party one more time like its 1999
