Starting over again is a bit like dancing
You just need someone to lead and take it slow
So lay your head on my shoulder
Let me hold you close, that's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go

Every day is like a new beginning
One door opens, while another starts to close
But just slip your arms around me
Cause life's a dance, don't know
That's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go

I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly
But you gotta try
So just hold on tight

Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
You're dancing
There you go
That's it
There you go
