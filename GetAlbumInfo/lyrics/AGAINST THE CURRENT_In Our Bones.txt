We are wild flowers
The city is our field of gold
We've got wild fire
In our bones

We're born to be electric
You and me, we're painting neon under our skin
It's a force you shouldn't mess with
Cause you and me, we're glowing bright
Radioactive

Bruises come and go
But our hearts beat louder
Than the thunder from the storm
In our darkest hours
We are not invincible
But we're both stronger than we know
In our bones
In our bones

We've got super powers
The city is our silver screen
Running 'round this little town
Wild and free

We're born to be electric
You and me, we're painting neon under our skin
It's a force you shouldn't mess with
Cause you and me, we're glowing bright
Radioactive

Bruises come and go
But our hearts beat louder
Than the thunder from the storm
In our darkest hours
We are not invincible
But we're both stronger than we know
In our bones
In our bones

We are wild flowers
The city is our field of gold
We've got wild fire
In our bones

Bruises come and go
But our hearts beat louder
Than the thunder from the storm
In our darkest hours
We are not invincible
But we're both stronger than we know
In our bones
In our bones
In our bones
In our bones
In our bones
In our bones
