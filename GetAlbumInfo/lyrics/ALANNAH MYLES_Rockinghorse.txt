I wonder what would happen if I fell
Would you pick me up and be my wishing well
If I shared my secrets would you promise not to tell
I wonder what would happen if I fell

I wonder what would happen if I smiled
Would you be the mystery in my eyes
I'll consent to marry you if you never lie
And I wonder what would happen if I smiled

Looking for a sign in the eyes of love
Waiting for an answer from the stars above
Would you be my story when there's nothing left to tell
I wonder what would happen if I fell

Would you be the rockinghorse I ride
If I showed no fear and held you like a child
Running through the darkness till there's morning in the sky
Would you be the rockinghorse I ride

Then I ride, ride, you can be my rockinghorse, so giddy-up
I said ride ride, ride ride, I said ride ride
