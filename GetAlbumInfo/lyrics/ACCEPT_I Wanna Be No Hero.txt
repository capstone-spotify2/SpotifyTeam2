When I'm down and when I'm feeling sad
You bring me up, you make me glad
Even if I'm really out of control
You stand by me when I stumble and fall

I'm confused tonight - I'm feeling blue
You'll find a way to help me through
Want you tonight 'cause I feel time is right
Need your sweeps bacause deep down inside

I can't give you nothing but love, babe
Tried to change, but it's pretty hard

I wanna be no hero, but I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, but I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero, oh, but I can give you love
Life is a mess - oh yeah

I know that living's not easy with me
But take my love - it's fair indeed
You drived away all my sorrows and pains
My love is strong, more than a game

I can't give you nothing but love, babe
Try to change - but it's pretty hard

I wanna be no hero
But I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, 
But I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero,
Ooh, but I can give you love

I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - stay by my side
I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - oh but I can give you love

I can't give you nothing but love, babe
Try to change - but it's pretty hard

I wanna be no hero
But I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, 
But I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero,
Ooh, but I can give you love
