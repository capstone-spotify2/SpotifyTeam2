Dawn awaits a sleepless, English town 
Of coloured gray
Here I roam the streets without you
As summer fades away

...down in the city at nights
The cold wind blows

Wherever you may be right now
It must be getting late 
You're probably asleep already
I am wide awake

...down in the city at nights

"Don't be lonely"
so you've told me
But don't you worry now
Loneliness can be ignored
And time has shown me how

... down in the city at nights
I'm missing you so much
Down in the city
Down in the city...
