Let there be a volume that cannot be denied.
Let there be an emotion that you cannot fake
The greatness unanimously acknowledged.
A lie that you just cannot tell.
Let them know hatred, fear and war. Let there be peace for us all.
With our goals one day met, let us know a feeling of great accomplishment.
With our failures complete, let us learn to survive.

Your body will know if it's not the right way to go, 
just listen closely to your heart and follow
You must be willing to abandon it all.
You must be willing to starve.

Let us challenge the wait for a day of reckoning.
Let us deny shame and guilt.
Let us know with absolute certainty that we were fools to ever second guess ourselves.
Let us know a feeling of invincibility, as real as our fragile bones.
There's a truth to be learned, I'm sure of it, 
just like I know there is nothing at all.

Your Body will know if it's not the right way to go, 
just listen closely to your heart and follow.
You must be willing to abandon it all.
You must be willing to starve.
