So I got my boots on,
Got the right amount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black colored liner
And I'm working my strut but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line 'tween the dark side,
And the light side, baby tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble, tryin'a find it

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But if I had you,
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you,
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you,
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA getting high, rock and rolling
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maserati's
What they need in this world is some love
There's a thin line 'tween the wild time,
And a flat-line, baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble, tryin'a find it

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But if I had you,
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you,
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you,
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had-

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I got you stuck on my mind, yeah
The fashion and the stage, it might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you,
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you,
Life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you,
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
(Never could compete with you)
If I had you, life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
(It'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you.
