I can hear the bells are ringing
I can hear the angels singing
My darling has left me
Whoa, somebody please help me
Cause I need someone to show me the way

Whoa, I can hear the people say
As I kneel and start to pray
His darling has left him
Whoa I want to tell you, somebody, somebody, help him
Cause he needs someone to show him the way, whoa

For at night when I think of you dear
At all times, all through the day
Why don't you come on, come on, come on darling
Cause I need a someone to show, show me the way

But how can I hear the bells ringing
Whoa I wanna tell you that I can hear, that I can hear the angels singing
My darling has left me, whoa I wanna get somebody, somebody help me
Cause I need someone to show me the way

Show me the way
