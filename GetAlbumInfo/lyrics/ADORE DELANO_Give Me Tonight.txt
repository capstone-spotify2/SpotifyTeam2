Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And though I act like I cannot hear
The situation is very clear
A girl whoâs trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say goodbye
And his answer tears my heart apart

Give me tonight
Then if you donât wanna stay
Girl Iâll just forget you
Youâll see Iâm right
You wonât get to go away
Love ainât gonna let you
Give me tonight

Walking with you through the park
Now itâs my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
Iâm telling you we must say goodbye
I canât believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart

Give me tonight
Then if you donât wanna stay
Girl Iâll just forget you
Youâll see Iâm right
You wonât get to go away
Love ainât gonna let you
Give me tonight <i>[x3]</i>

Gimme <i>[x14]</i>

Give me tonight
Then if you donât wanna stay
Girl Iâll just forget you
Youâll see Iâm right
You wonât get to go away
Love ainât gonna let you
Give me tonight <i>[x3]</i>
