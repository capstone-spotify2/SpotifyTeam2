I will take my time this time
I'm gonna make a
rhyme this time

I'll ring the bell this time
The dreaming's over
I'm gonna sing "Gotta Wing" this time

I've no sweets to sell
This time
The scheming's over
I'm gonna be only me this time

Most unfortunately, my dreams
Never knew the ground
Every mirror I see, reminds
Me you're not around
I let you down

All my stories tell, this time
The dreaming's over
I'm gonna bring everything
This time

<i>[Guitar Solo]</i>

Most unfortunately, my dreams
Never knew the ground
Every mirror I see, reminds
Me you're not around
I let us down

I will ring the bell this time
The dreaming's over
I'm gonna sing "Gotta Wing" this time

I will take my time this time
I'm gonna make a rhyme this time
I will make a rhyme this time
I'm gonna take my time this time
