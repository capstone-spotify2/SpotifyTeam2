I feel like giving up
Nothing's good enough
A piece of me is gone
But deep within these ashes
There's a healing passion
So I carry on

And somehow I stay strong

'Cause it's love that keeps us alive
When we're broken down inside
Well, it's you that I can trust
When there's nothing left
Well, I know I'm blessed
It's love, it's love

Across a hundred seas
A twisted hold on me
Forever will I stay
I've searched all seven oceans
And found that secret potion
That will make it all okay

So open your doors and pray

'Cause it's love that keeps us alive
When we're broken down inside
Well, it's you that I can trust
When there's nothing left
Well, I know I'm blessed
It's love, it's love

It's love, it's love

'Cause it's love that keeps us alive
When we're broken down inside
Well, it's you that I can trust
When there's nothing left
Well, I know I'm blessed
It's love

I'm not giving up
This feels good enough
I'm blessed with love
I'm not giving up
This feels good enough
I'm blessed with love

I'm not giving up
This feels good enough
I'm blessed with love
I'm not giving up
This feels good enough
I'm blessed with love
