You are reliable as a painting in wave wet sand

I look in your eyes and I can't see a thing
That usually means attraction to me
I've read all the books about love I could find
And I've found not one, no, not one word 'bout mine

'Cause you are reliable as a painting in wave wet sand
You're coming and you're going: like the water you never end
'Cause you are reliable as a painting in wave wet sand
And I am just another piece of an island in reach for your hands

...feel my doubts when you are in my arms
Darling: if you know that it's love and not charm
You must tell me so or go elsewhere to hunt

'Cause you are reliable...
Your love...

I am just another piece of an island

I can't close my eyes when I hear that you call
I don't want to fear every tear that could fall
I'll go on my own, and pass people with doubts
My goal is to find a piece of your love

Your love is - your love is like the water
You are like the water
You are like the water
You, you are my shore, and you know you are my shore
