well she's a woman of the world, and God she knows it 
she'll turn my head every time she shows it 
yeah, nothin' you can do, nothin' you can say 
no way you can try to change her way 
she might be gone tomorrow, honey say what you gotta say 
lordy what a woman 
how ya feelin'
well I tried so hard to please her
she'd give me a look if I beg to tease her
there's nothin' you can say, nothin' you can do 
no way you can try to coochie coo 
she might be gone tomorrow, oh lordy what you gonna do? 
and I tried with an open hand and a heart of sorrow 
hoped that everything would be alright 
don't save too much lovin' for tomorrow 
get out all your lovin' here tonight 
she got big-eyed cats, she got coats of sable 
she seats forty-four at her dinner table 
and there's nothin' you can do, nothin' you can say 
no way you can try to change her way 
she might be gone tomorrow, oh throwin' it all away
