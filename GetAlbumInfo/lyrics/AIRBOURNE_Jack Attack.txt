Well I'm dizzy from the malt and barley
You can't keep me from the sugar honeys
Dancing off my feet, rockin' to the beat
I never get enough, I love it,
I'm a reckless, defenseless
Don't care if I regret it

Jack Attack
Jack Attack
Give me a Jack Attack
I want a Jack Attack
Pour me another Jack
Yeah

I got a single barrel shot through the heart
And I'm screaming at the top oh my lungs yeah
Dancing off my feet, rockin' to the beat
I never get enough, I love it,
I'm a reckless, defenseless
Don't care if I regret it

Jack Attack
Jack Attack
Give me a Jack Attack
I want a Jack Attack
Pour me another baby I love it yeah

Jack Attack
Give me a Jack Attack
I want a Jack Attack
I said a Jack Attack
Pour me another
Jack Attack
Pour me another
Jack Attack
Baby I want a
Jack Attack
Pour me another
Jack Attack
Pour me another Jack
Pour me another Jack baby oh yeah
Taste so good, leave the ice on the side.
