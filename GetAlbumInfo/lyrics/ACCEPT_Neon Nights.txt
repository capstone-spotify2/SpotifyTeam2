When the day is done
The night rolls in
Lonely lovers come alive

Like a heartbeat
In a world of sin
Cruising around hungry eyes

Like a midnight train
Going nowhere
Fading dreams of the city

Penthouse beds
Sweet love affairs
Crimes of passion for the pretty

Man in blue on his beat
Unseen faces in the streets

Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights - never change
Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights

Red eye whisky
And lady luck
Have always been good friends

Their love is pain
The same old stuff
Always alone in the end

Could they be me and you
Watching how the nights move

Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights - never change
Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights

Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights - never change
Neon nights - neon nights - endless flame
Neon nights - neon nights

Neon nights, ...
