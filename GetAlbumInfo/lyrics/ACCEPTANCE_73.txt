There's nothing to lose, but you're still losing
Nothing to give, but you're still giving back
There's no one to leave that ain't worth leaving
Nothing to love that ain't worth loving back

And if I ever really want to feel alive
I take a look into you when the suns confine

I'm still here
I'm still here

Should I lose my will?
Should I chase the thrill?
I could be anyone
Is there a grace to give?
In the place you live?
Oh I can't wait anymore

And if I ever really want to feel alive
I take a look into you when the suns confine

I'm still here
You're just in time, in time to save me
I'm still here
Hell is close, but will you find me?
Oh when you live in this life alone lose fear
I'm still here

Will you live one more, one more life with me?
Life with me

I'm still here
You're just in time, in time to save me
I'm still here
Heaven's close, but will you take me?
Oh when you live in this life alone lose fear
I'm still here
I'm still here
