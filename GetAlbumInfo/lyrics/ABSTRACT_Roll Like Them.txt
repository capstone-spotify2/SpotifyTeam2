Touched down in the city, with some weight on my back
Been at it all year, to put some weight on my track
I've been running like the flash tryna get some time back
Pedal to the metal, hoping that I don't crash 
Been a lot on my mind, and even more on my plate 
But I had to make a move, yeah you know I couldn't wait
Poppin' overseas, on as ever in the states
Even though it's been a minute since I've been up on stage

Now I'm cruisin' down the I5
I've been so caught up in my grind
It's been hectic tryna find time
Sorry if you missed me on my line
I've been smokin'
I've been drinkin'
They say I do too much thinkin'
I know they're right
I just lose sight
Guess I'm lost in my thoughts tonight

I just wanna roll like them
Doin' shows livin' on the road like them
I just wanna roll like them
Fans at the door in the cold like them

I just wanna roll like them
Doin' shows livin on the road like them
I just wanna roll like them
Fans at the door in the cold like them

I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna roll like them 
I just wanna roll like them

I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, roll like them

Remember writin' just to get away, now I'm writin' just so I can stay
Thankful I can even say, we the ones who came up, came up, came up and made away
Funny how I trip bout' where we at, even though it's been a trip just to get to where we at
I'm scattered round' the map like a flash grenade 
But the shards plant mines, been a hit parade

Ask about me in your city, with the ones who really know
They gon' hate or love me, still know all I do is grow
Know they hear my flow, sayin' I'm too radio
But my content's complex, best of both roads
Put me in a box then you ask em' "Done your research?"
Track record made, got you bowin' till' your knees hurt
I came from beneath dirt, just to bring the ether
We gon' be okay till' it's oh a k a feature 

Now I'm cruisin' down the I5
I've been so caught up in my grind
It's been hectic tryna find time
Sorry if you missed me on my line
I've been smokin'
I've been drinkin'
They say I do too much thinkin'
I know they're right
I just lose sight
Guess I'm lost in my thoughts tonight

I just wanna roll like them
Doin' shows livin' on the road like them
I just wanna roll like them
Fans at the door in the cold like them

I just wanna roll like them
Doin' shows livin on the road like them
I just wanna roll like them
Fans at the door in the cold like them

I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna roll like them 
I just wanna roll like them

I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna roll like them
I just wanna, roll like them
