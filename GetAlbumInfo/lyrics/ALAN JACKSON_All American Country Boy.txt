I work a forty hour week and I earn my keep
And I try to walk proud and tall
I keep my nose to the ground, I don't get behind
And I don't back up at all
Well my neck's a little red, my collar's blue
I sip a little coffee, and I drink a little booze

'Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
'Cause I'm an all American country boy

I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
I'm hooked on T.V., Rolaids, and B.C.'s
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change

'Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
'Cause I'm an all American country boy

Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father Time can slow you down
I'm still doin' all I used to do
It just takes a little longer now

'Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
'Cause I'm an all American country boy

I'm just a country boy
A good ol' country boy
