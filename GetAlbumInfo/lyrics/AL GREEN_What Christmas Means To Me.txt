Oh, yeah
Candles burning low
Lot's of mistletoe
Lot's of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah

I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As reaches and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once
And then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas
Baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And happiness
Happiness in the coming year
Oh, yeah

Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
(Christmas means to me, my love)

Let's deck the halls
With holly
Sing a silent night
Fill a sheet
With angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Hey, yeah

That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Yeah
Oh, yes
