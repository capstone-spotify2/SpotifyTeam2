I'd like to thank you all for having me
In this village filled with tragedy
This is something you won't want to miss
I swear it doesn't have to be like this

Reject these who ain't reject
Blood spills for who ain't been blessed
We'll stay true while you obsess
We'll see who wakes up next

Here's to the losers
The substance abusers
The beaten and broken down
Don't look now
All the bluest skies are turning black

Feels like a killer on the loose again
Save me from this pool of blood I'm drowning in
So be thankful for all this steam my friends
And at giving time we all give in

Reject these who ain't reject
Blood spills for who ain't been blessed
We'll stay true while you obsess
We'll see who wakes up next

Here's to the losers
The substance abusers
The beaten and broken down
Don't look now
All the bluest skies are turning black

Let's remember this day
When we're sober again
There's nothing left they can say
Whatever they take they can't take that away

Here's to the losers
The substance abusers
The beaten and broken down
Don't look now
All the bluest skies are turning black

Skies are turning black

Here's to the losers (Skies are turning black)
Substance abusers (Skies are turning black)
Here's to the losers
