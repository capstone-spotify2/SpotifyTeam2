I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You'll change
You'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2

You said you'd change
But I'm afraid
It's something I won't live to see
It's seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy

Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game ( Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)

Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you

You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2

Because of you, I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
I've been a fool (Ben - I've been a fool)
A fool for you (Ben - A fool for you)
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me

Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)

Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you

I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

(Instrumental break)

You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2

Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)

Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're still the same old brand new you

Another night, another day
What I can say
You break your promises in two
What can I do

Another night, another day
What I can say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
You're still the same old brand new you
