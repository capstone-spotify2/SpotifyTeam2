Gentle conversation, walking hand in hand
Sunset on the water, footsteps in the sand
And our hearts beat in rhythm to the waves that are rolling in
Oh, I wonder, is this how love begins?

Day turns to night and there's music in the air
The candle light casts a glow around your hair
The touch of your body, your fingers on my skin
Oh, I wonder, is this how love begins?

Woooo...is this how love begins?

I've been lonely for so long,
Like a man stranded in the rain
If someone had said I'd be in love tonight,
I'd have told 'em that they were insane...insane (Yeeah, Yeeeah.)

Well, can it be real, is this happening to me?
Is that the look of love, in your eyes I see?
Is my waiting over, is it my chance to win?
Oh, I wonder, is this how love begins?

Woooo...is this how love begins?
Woooo...is this how love begins?
Wooo...Woooooo...
