We party till' the sun lights up the sky

You're right here for me I'm right here for you let's go,
I'm taking my time, I'm taking it slow
Hello,
Take control
We got one more chance so let's go to the dance of it
Cause you know it now or never
I'm gonna take control of it
I wanna take control of your mind and your body and soul
Make plans and I can't believe we're still here
See love flying around in the air,
I'm yours, baby your mine,
We ain't wasting no time
We got that fresh love ting going on
Some say that it's right some say that it's wrong
My life's unreal but it ain't a dream,
This girls got a body like you won't believe
I make the first move now she don't wanna leave,
I thinks she likes me,
I'll take the lead,
One thing leads to the next,
It starts off with a little kiss on the neck,
Then I wake up with my arm over her chest,
Thinking about last night there's never a regret.

Close the door,
What you waiting for,
I can't believe you're here with me,
Close your eyes it's just you and I,
Get ready to fly,
We can party all night till the sun lights up the sky,
And when the stars come out I'll be right here by your side,
So take control,
Don't let it go,
Take control,
Cause you know it's now or never,
I'm a take control of it,

I grab you by the hands and roll out,
Let's go now,
I wanna get to a place where it goes down,
Where the party starts but don't hold out,
Anything goes,
I wanna take you there
