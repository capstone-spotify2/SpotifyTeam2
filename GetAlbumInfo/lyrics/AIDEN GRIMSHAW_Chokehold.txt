Rolling...
Wooo...

Is this the soul that I'll die with?
Or a love that I'll buy in?
I'm trying to find myself an answer

Is this a heart I can trust?
And slam the door as I rushed in
I'm wondering how I can live without you

Ahhhh ahh ahhhhh ahh...
Falling in love with you.
Ahhhh ahh ahhhhh ahh...
Falling in love with you.

It's just a matter of time
Before I know wrong from right
Gonna fight for a while until it finds me

Can't help but dwell on the past
Don't make a song in the dance
Take a chance until our heart is broken

Ahhhh ahh ahhhhh ahh...
Falling in love with you.
Ahhhh ahh ahhhhh ahh...
Falling in love with you.

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow, oh

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow, oh

Another night in the cold
And now the question unfolds
All alone, writing quotes all over paper

All of these thoughts trapped inside me
Wrapped around me so tightly
It's frightening how I can't live without you

Ahhhh ahh ahhhhh ahh...
Falling in love with you.

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow, oh

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
I tried to run but I was too slow
I tried to run but I was too slow

Oh, love
Who you waiting for?
Me
I'm too slow
Wait for me
For me

Oh, love
Who you wait?
Me

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow, oh

Oh, Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
Cupid got me in a chokehold
I tried to run but I was too slow
