Alright...
The stars in the LA sky tonight are shinning
I never knew it was time to say goodbye
You left us here tonight alone and crying

Why would you have to go
You broke my heart
I hardened though
You please, dear God, tell me it's not true

Nothing makes sense anymore
I don't know what I've been living for
I used to see, now I am blind
âCause your light went out in a blink of an eye

Time...
Was it never seem to be enough time?
You turned around and it's time to say goodbye
Oh I, oh I, oh time
She is a killer
She is a killer
She is a killer, is a killer, is a killer

Tonight not a single cloud in the sky
And the moon shines bright
But I need a hurricane just to make this feel alright
Come on tonight
Come on tonight

You caught me trying to figure out
All these things I used to care about
Trying to get a hit, trying to win the race
Such a wasted time, such a wasted space

I'm not even sure how to say goodbye
Is there a God above or a just a big black sky?
Can you feel my tears?
Can you hear me cry?

Time...
Was it never seem to be enough time?
You turned around and it's time to say goodbye
Oh I, oh I, oh time
She is a killer
She is a killer
She is a killer, is a killer, is a killer

I feel sick
I can't sleep, I can't walk, I can't sit
And I'm hoping this will pass
Seems like nothing never lasts
Seems like nothing ever lasts more than a minute
And you left this world but I'm so in it
So I'll try to do better
Try to make a better place everyday
Be good to each other
That's all I have to say
âCause in a blink of an eye the whole world can change

Time...
Was it never seem to be enough time?
You turned around and it's time to say goodbye
Oh I, oh I, oh time
She is a killer
She is a killer
She is a killer, is a killer, is a killer
