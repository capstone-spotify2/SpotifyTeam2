Why you are such an ignorant and misbehaving child
Is what everybody wants to know
You blame your family for every careless in the past
You're just taking cover from yourself

Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Giving it up for a helping hand
Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Young man you're too good to be true

And you are such a wild young man
Can't keep away from him
Things are always so out of control
Just dress me, I'm your teacher
Gonna make you shapen up
I will tame the wilderness in you

Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Giving it up for a helping hand
Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Young man you're too good to be true

Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
Well I'm giving it up for you
What more can I do
