To me where the wild things are is a place that exists is our minds.
Itâs a place of liberty and shamelessness.
It can take a split second or a lifetime to find it,
But once you do, youâll be free

Find table space to say your social graces
Bow your heads, they're pious here, but you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules, our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here

So gather all the rebels now, we'll rabble-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say, no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
We'll be alright, don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
We'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread
I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd,
The cool kids aren't cool to me,
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
We'll be alright, don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
We'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find your grace, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
We'll be alright, don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
We'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

Thereâs a wild thing that exists in all of us.
It lives in our passions, in the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs.
Itâs even made a home in the darkest parts of us.
But we canât be scared of it.
We have to become it.
