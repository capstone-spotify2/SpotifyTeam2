<i>[English translation:]</i>

Where did it start to go wrong oh god
Even when I meet you I didn't laugh
I'm suffocated
As time goes
Doubt and obsession grow more
Actually I'm anxious
It's better that you're gone

Please be a little more honest
Your growing lies
Your memorized excuse
Your bold story

Erase the memories inside that left
Forget the stupid me who believed you
No not another word
Don't hold on to me anymore

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
You who got two faces
You who changes so much
Cause you don't

Your obvious story
Protect your silent mouth
Avoid my gaze, focus to the ground
Your trembling eyes
Rather than any words, louder to me
Tell me what I believed

Your changes appearance
All memories came
In the end they become despair
And changes into regret
My tears is not you
Because I hate the past me
Get your disgusting hands off of me
I totally hate you

Please be a little more honest
I'm tired of your lies
Now I see you
Your bold story

I've done everything I can
But you're never satisfied
This show has been so long
It's time to be sick of it
My times, effort, the useless hurt
The fluttering unexpectedly strong
Together with farewell, black out

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

The things like pride don't put it to me
You have been a loser till the end
Our happy memories
Now end the unfunny show

I won't regret anymore
Cause all I have it my faith in me

I'm letting go letting go
Don't say no cause I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
I'm letting go letting go
Raise two hands and two feet and I'm letting go
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Don't tell me I don't know
(Don't tell me I don't know)
Cause you don't

Oh oh (actin like you right)
Oh oh (our dreams gone tonight)
I have no regret
I will forget like this
