<i>[2002 version bonus track]</i>

I saw them slipping in the dark
For heaven's sake what's going on
It's like someone is here
Gotta follow now
Like being in a trance for me
There's silence here
More than all the noise
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Everyday, everynight
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Oh yeah
Down on my knees, God help me please
Gotta know who's out in the dark
I've stopped my breath, can feel the hands
Could hear the sound of people making love
I surrender right now
I've to be touched. I feel so much
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Everyday, everynight
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Yeah
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Everyday, everynight
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Everyday, everynight
Spurting in the dark head over heels
Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels
Everyday, everynight
Head over heels - head over heels - everyday, everynight
Head over heels - head over heels - everyday, everynight
Head over heels - head over heels - everyday, everynight
Head over heels - head over heels - everyday, everynight
