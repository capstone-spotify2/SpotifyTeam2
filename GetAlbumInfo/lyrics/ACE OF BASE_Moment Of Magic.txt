Music's in the air
They're all on their way to meet
With expectations
Everybody takes the highway to happiness today
I'm falling for you

Green grass and empty chairs
I am preparing a party
I do it for you
So slow I welcome you
It's a moment of magic

Cold champagne on ice
I will always drink to you
Hope you will notice
What everybody knows
That I am in love with you tonight

Green grass and empty chairs
I am preparing a party
I do it for you
So slow I welcome you
It's a moment of magic
A moment of magic

Green grass and empty chairs
I am preparing a party
I do it for you
So slow I welcome you
It's a moment of magic
A moment of magic

(Moments of magic)
I don't know how I dare
As always be cautious
Is out of the question

I don't believe in lucky stars
I never had the answers oh-oh
You could restore my faith in truth
Change my vision

Green grass and empty chairs
I am preparing a party
I do it for you
So slow I welcome you
It's a moment of magic
A moment of magic
