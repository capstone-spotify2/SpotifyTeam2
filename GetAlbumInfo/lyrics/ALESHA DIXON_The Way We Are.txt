Every move we make
Call it a mistake
Looking at a wall
Like a prisoner in chains
Tell us that we're wrong
Tell us what we want
Throw us in a notion
That I know we don't belong

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt,
Love is so...
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the...
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the...
Just the way we are

Now who we gonna be
Nobody can tell
But you're tryna write a script for me
That's made for someone else
Changing up the rules
Rules I gotta break
But the diamond that's inside of me
Will always be a fake

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt,
Love is so...
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the...
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the...
Just the way we are

Show them your light
Don't turn them down
It's not their right
To come and criticize
Show them your light
It's a miracle
Love is so just the way we are

Just the way we are (never change who we are)
Just the way we are (never change who we are)
Just the way we are (stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (never change who we are)
Just the way we are (stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (never change who we are)
Just the way we are
All I'm asking is you to love that...
Just the way we are
