One little fight can start a war
One angry word can throw a whole lifetime away
And in that moment you forget 
How much you promised you would never 
Treat the one you love this way

Then it will pass as all things do
Then you are left with only guilt and sheepish texts
Hoping the one you love will
Give you one more chance to
Spare you one more thing to add to your regrets

Love conquers all
Even wisdom and well-being
Is beaten by the storm
This life is so short
And I've had enough of fighting
I wanted to be yours

They say love conquers all
Even confidence and courage
Retreat against the force
What's left is so small
The battle's never ending 
And I don't want to fall

The morning comes and so do I
When things get clearer we attempt to make amends
We make a promise once again
To not give up until
We're figured out the place our story ends 

Oh by the night we feel so tired
Our optimism worn away by doubts and fears
We made it through another day
Without it helping us
To understand quite how we made it here

Love conquers all
Even wisdom and well-being
Are beaten by the storm
This life is so short
And I've had enough of fighting
I wanted to be yours

They say love conquers all
Even confidence and courage
Retreat against the force
What's left is so small
The battle's never ending 
And i don't want to fall
