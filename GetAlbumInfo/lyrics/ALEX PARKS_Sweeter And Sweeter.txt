One touch intense as pain on my lips 
You laid it bold
I am told of you 
You show me 
I want you 
So take me

You make me sweat 
My body weeps for you
Sweeter and sweeter
Trembling but still I stole my breath 
And you

I fell with ease onto 
Your floor you're there 
Embrace me
Its like you knew

You make me sweat 
My body weeps for you
Sweeter and sweeter
Trembling but still I stole my breath 
And you

I listen hard 
We beat the same
I realise the point of my life
I hold you so close 
So close I won't let go
I don't want to

You make me sweat 
My body weeps for you
Sweeter and sweeter
Trembling but still I stole my breath 
And you

You make me sweat 
My body weeps for you
Sweeter and sweeter
Trembling but still I stole my breath 
And you
And you 
And you 
And you
