She got that Aquafina water, it ain't even been right since
Done fucked her all in my car girl, don't even got no tint
Like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the things that I do all to you
You done fell in love with a young nigga fucking on this money
Gon' fuck you all in the condo, gon fuck you in other countries
Can't deny the feeling when you cummin'
Don't keep your tickling, you know I love it
You know I'm addicted to you, you know I touch it
You know it ain't nobody act like me
I sweep you off your feet, your shoe game
Still murder

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Like it's overtime at the 9-5
You gotta get yours first
