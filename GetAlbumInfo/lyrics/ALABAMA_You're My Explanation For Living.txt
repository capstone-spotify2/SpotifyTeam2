Oh, we had a good night last night
Like every other night
We made love and everything was just right (just right)
Oh, lovin you is as fresh as a dew in early morning
And you're my explanation for living

And you're my, my explanation for living mhm
Without your sweet, sweet love, I'd be nothing
Oh I'd be just like a baby without its bottle
With a tear-stained face
And I'd be empty as the week without days
Oh, and I'd be like a river without water that was running
And you're my explanation for living

Oh, you took me to the wine and the roses, yes you did baby
You did some magic with your pocket full of posies
Oh you give me everything, oh yes you do
And somehow you keep right on giving
You're my explanation for living

And you're my, my explanation for living
Without your sweet, sweet love, i'd be nothing
Oh, I'd be just like a baby without its bottle
With a tear-stained face
And i'd be empty as the week without its days
Oh, and I'd be like a river without water that was running
And you're my explanation for living

Oh, you give me everything, oh yes you do
And somehow, baby, you keep right on giving
You're my, my explanation for living
