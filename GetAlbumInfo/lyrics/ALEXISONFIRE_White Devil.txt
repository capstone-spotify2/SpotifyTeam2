Hey kids, we got a new white devil
And it goes in your fucking nose
That's right, we got a new white devil
This is how the story goes
Story goes

Watch out!

Glorify, glamorize
Try to forget your sunken eyes
Your dead fad is a disaster
Your fashion is my fucking cancer
Not so fun when your nose is sore
Bloody Kleenex all over the floor
But don't worry, who gives a shit?
All your friends will think you're really hip

Your dead fad is a fucking disaster

Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah <i>[7x]</i>
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in this year

Looks so good
Convulsing on the floor, ya sugar!
And the blood from your nose
Matches your lipstick shade

What a fucking nightmare

Look what you have become
White devil, white devil, white devil <i>[3x]</i>

White devil <i>[8x]</i>
