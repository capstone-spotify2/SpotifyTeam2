Los Angeles 
Shameful city
I've been taken by the world below
Los Angeles

No

Here I am again
Watching the world go by
Right before my eyes
All the things I should have known
Have started to hit hard
What you are 
What you are
But you won't let go
What you are
But you won't let go

Los Angeles 
Shameful city
I've been taken by the world that's down below
Los Angeles

A flickering eye
Casting a silhouette
Someone I used to know
But that person is gone
I gotta try to keep telling myself I got it under control

What you are 
What you are
But you won't let go
What you are
But you won't let go

Los Angeles 
Shameful city
I've been taken by the world that's down below
Los Angeles

This time's where I remember when
I'd deal with it all over again

Los Angeles 
Shameful city
I've been taken by the world that's down below
Los Angeles
Shameful city
I've been taken by the world below
Los Angeles
Los Angeles
Los Angeles
