Hey, anybody wanna hear something dirty?
Well ya know, You're gonna have to help me
You know that old building, next to the Indian burial grounds?
Well word has it
There's a chest buried underneath the floor boards under the stairway there
And inside it, there's all type of dirty history
Left behind by this crazy warrior
And people say if it was ever dug up
It would bring this guy back around
Then he would spread all these messages himself
So now that I've told you all
Do you still wanna hear something dirty?
Ok, follow me
Look, there's the stairway
Come on, hurry up, let's pull up these floor boards
Look, there it is, help me pull it up
Quick, give me something to break off this lock
Cool, now help me open it up
What the!
