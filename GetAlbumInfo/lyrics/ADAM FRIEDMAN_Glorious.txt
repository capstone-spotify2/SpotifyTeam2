After searching trying to find ya
I thought I'd lost my luck
But I'd never thought in a million years that
You would just walk right up

Now that I found your love
I could never let you down
Even when the times get rough
Nothing's gonna stop us now

We'll grow old
And we'll never be alone
And no matter where we roam
We'll glorious
We'll glorious and you know it's true

Now we're glowing
Like a fire
Illuminating from within, hey!
So we keep on
Climbing higher
To the sky we're going where we've never been

Now that we've set us free, hey!
Nothing's going to hold us down, hey!
Even when the time get rough, hey!
We'll never lose the fight in us

We'll grow old
And we'll never be alone
And no matter where we roam
We'll be glorious, hey!
We'll grow old
And we'll never be alone
And no matter where we roam
We'll be glorious
We'll be glorious and you know it's true

You and I we're never gonna rest
Keep up the dream
Like it's life or death
And you and I we're never giving in
Never giving in
Never giving in
And you and I we're never gonna rest
Keep up the dream
Like it's life or death
And you and I, we're never giving in
Never giving in
We're never giving never giving

We'll grow old
And we'll never be alone
And no matter where we roam
We'll be glorious, hey!
We'll grow old
And we'll never be alone
And no matter where we roam
We'll be glorious
We'll be glorious and you know it's true
