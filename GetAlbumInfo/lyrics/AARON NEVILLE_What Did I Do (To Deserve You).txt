Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet 
Inconceivable that you're a part of me 
Innocent look in your eyes 
Love without compromise for me 
It's a mystery 

What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hands could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 
Oh Yeah 

Unconventional, describes my love for you 
Unconditional, cause there's nothing I won't do 
I pray as this feeling grows 
That you always touch the heart and soul of me 
It's a mystery 

What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hand could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 

I've waited all my life to hold such a treasure 
What is this feeling worth, there is no measure 
Tell me what can I do 

What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hand could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I'd, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 
To deserve you
