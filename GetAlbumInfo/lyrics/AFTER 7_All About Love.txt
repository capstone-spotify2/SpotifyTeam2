You wont regret it
Lets make it happen right now

There's no one, no one like me
I've been told so many times before
And if it was true
I know he couldn't do you like I do
And do the things I do to you, yeah baby

You see, you see that I'm a special guy
I thought you knew everything
Before you got involved with me
You know that I'm the one to get the job done
Oh girl, I love you naturally

There should not be a doubt in your mind
I have to prove myself to you a thousand times
And if you want real love, then come with me
I wont do you wrong, I'll love you all night long

1-I'm all about love
2-it ain't no joke
3-I can do you right
4-just stay the night
You wont regret it, let's make it happen right now 

Soon and very soon, you should make that move
And if you don't somebody will take your place
But I do care
I feel I need to have you with me girl
You better take time and understand my wishes
But don't get confused with them
Oh I'm about lovin you and that's all I wanna do
I wanna take you to another level

There should not be a doubt in your mind
I have to prove myself to you a thousand times
And if you want real love
Then come with me
I wont do you wrong
I'll love you all night long

1-I'm all about love
2-it ain't no joke
3-I can do you right
4-just stay the night
You wont regret it, let's make it happen right now
