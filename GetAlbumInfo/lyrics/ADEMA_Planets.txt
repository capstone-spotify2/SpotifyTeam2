Despite these imperfections, despite all I say
Inside in recollections, I'm done with yesterday

I will lose my mind, make it real this time,
To leave it all behind, I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign, planets will align,
I'm gonna blow my mind, I won't cry wolf

The one I trust is consoled me, this is over now
But I didn't want to really , everyone I trusted deceived me

I will lose my mind, make it real this time,
To leave it all behind, I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign, planets will align,
I'm gonna blow my mind, I won't cry wolf

I'm holding on too tight, I can't let go,
I'm hiding I'm needy, on the inside I'm bleeding
I'm searching for something but it can't seem to find me
On the surface is someone who pretends to focus
I'm waiting and wanting to cut this and go on, trying to live, when the pain can all be gone
We've only seen the future the voice in my head is leaving me here back home

I will lose my mind, make it real this time,
To leave it all behind, I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign, planets will align,
I'm gonna blow my mind, I won't cry wolf
