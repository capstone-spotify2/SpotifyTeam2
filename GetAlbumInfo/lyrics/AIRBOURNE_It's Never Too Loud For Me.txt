Oh, yeah!

The ground is shaking at my feet
As I feel the thunder of the beat
Lightning flashing, windows smashing
Stand up, get out of your seat

Decibels never hurt no one
All they do is crank up the fun
Rock and Roll ain't no crime
It ain't nothing but a damn good time

My ears are ringing,
But I keep singing

It's never too loud, it's never too loud for me
It's never too loud, it's never too loud for me

Don't you tell me what to play
I can't hear a word you say
'Cause the music's loud, I've drowned you out
I ain't ever gonna change

'Cause I stand my ground like a wall of sound
There ain't no way you can drag me down
'Cause the volume's high,
So am I
You can't put this fire out

My ears are ringing,
But I keep singing

It's never too loud, it's never too loud for me
No, it's never too loud, it's never too loud for me

It's never, never
No, it's never, never, never too loud

Oh, it's never too loud (never too loud)
It's never too loud for me (never too loud)
Turn it up louder

It's never too loud, it's never too loud for me
It's never too loud, it's never too loud for me
Never too loud for me (never too loud)
Never too loud for me (never too loud)
Never too loud for me (never too loud)
Never too loud for me
