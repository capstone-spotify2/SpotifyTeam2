When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
We'll be coming back for more

I know I might seem weird
One day I'm around, the next I disappear
This is a crazy act
But I won't think I'm kissing you till that's a fact
Cause always, ever after and more

<i>[Chorus]</i>
When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
I'm at your door, coming back for more
Dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of daylight
Like we did before
We'll be coming back for more

We're on a one-way ride
And all I need is someone like you by my side
You saw the movie too
We'll ride into the sunset like they always do
For all days, all nights
I'll hurt some more

<i>[Chorus]</i>

We'll be coming back for more
If I'm still number one
The one you're looking for
I won't be gone for long
No, I'll be back for more

<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
