I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since

It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know
What's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

When I go to my brother, my brother, my brother
And I say,Â "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up knockin' me
Right down on my, on the knees

And there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think
I'm able to carry on

It's been a long
A long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

It's been a long
It's been a long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
