What we doing tonight!?

<i>[Hook:]</i>
I got a few rolled up and my cup half full
I am way too lit and Iâm with my woes
I got on designer, got on all this ice
Got that foreign out front and itâs parked outside
We donât want no problems, though we bout that life
Bring them bad ones through; Iâm in town for a night, YEAH!
Shining my nigga, just know that Iâm here for the hoes!
I pull up the foreign: I did it to get me some hoes!
Iâm faded, unfadedable, nigga donât ruin my zone!
You smell the money thatâs on me, thatâs just my cologne!
I know she with it, cause shorty in love with the dough!

I walked in no talking, just rocks in my watches (whoo!)
All hoes Iâm fucking, I canât even acknowledge (yee!)
Get money, mo money money your college fund in my pocket! (whoo!)
Jealous, they jealous these munchies yee' ainât got them! (oof!)
Pop a pill and get charged up, how you feel? I give no fucks!
You, you, and your homegirl can meet me in the back of my tour bus!
Young nigga go way up, fuck her good with her legs up!
Came in with yo girlfriend, but I leave with her cause she chose up! (OOH!)
Said she never fucked with a rich nigga (Sorry)

Money donât make you real no, niggas be stunting in the rental
Niggas get stuck in the friendzone, me and yo bitch in the Benzo!
And we fly, hop on the flight to Dubai, fuck if you like it or not
Puffinâ the lye, I am considered the guy maybe you mustâve forgot
I want the world, I need the prettiest girl, I want the one with the curves
Give her the word, you know the one you deserve
