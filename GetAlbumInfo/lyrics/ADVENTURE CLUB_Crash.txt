I try my best just to get away
But you pulled me closer
You're something wild I can never tame
And you're taking over
All my thoughts and the words I say
Never seem to matter
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after

Never thought I would be okay
When the pain took over
A disease moving through my brain
Makes my vision slower
Try and run but I can't escape
As my whole world shatters
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
