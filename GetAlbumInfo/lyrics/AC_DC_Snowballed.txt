Crashed out of the market
Out on the floor
Washed up on the shore
Bombed outta the city
Out of the door
Blown up against the wall
Put out of the picture
Axe about to fall
Walk before you crawl
Dragged down to the bottom
Screamin' for air
The shark must get his share
You can see it comin'
Miles and miles away
Women drink and money
Are gonna make you pay
Snowballed, ooh yeah
Snowballed, they done it again
Snowballed, makin' me blind
Snowballed

The howl of the wolf
Snow in his eyes
Waitin' to take you by surprise
Eye of the needle
Heat of the fight
Watch those teeth cause they're ready to bite
You can see it comin'
Miles and miles away
Women drink and money
Are gonna make you pay
You've been
Snowballed, yes you have
Snowballed, you've been fooled again
Snowballed, that's all
Snowballed

Snowballed, snowballed, snowballed, snowballed
Snowballed, snowballed, snowballed, snowballed
You been snowballed
You been snow, you been snow, you been snow
Snowballed, balled balled balled
