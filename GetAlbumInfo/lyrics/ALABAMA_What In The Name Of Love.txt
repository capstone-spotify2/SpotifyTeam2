Early morning and as I rise
You won't even open your eyes
You used to love this time together
Now you won't even say goodbye
With the passin' time I've watched you change
My love for you still remains the same
Your love for me used to come so easy
Now it seldom comes at all.

Could it be we're really over
Has all the lovin' gone
Is it fin'lly time to face the hurt
I've dreaded for so long
Tell me what in the name of love
Have I done wrong.

I hope in time we'll find a way
To bring our lovin' back someday
If your new life's not what you expected
Call and I'll come back home
I hate to leave but I've got to go
Don't ask why I'm sure you know
Your love for me I can't share with another
It hurts me so.

Could it be we're really over
Has all the lovin' gone
Is it fin'lly time to face the hurt
I've dreaded for so long
Tell me what in the name of love
Have I done wrong.

Could it be we're really over
Has all the lovin' gone
Is it fin'lly time to face the hurt
I've dreaded for so long
Tell me what in the name of love
Have I done wrong.

Early morning and as I rise
You won't even open your eyes
Your love for me used to come so easy
Now it seldom comes at all...
