<i>[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
You know the name, Top Dawg, bitch!
No cat in this, I volunteered for these Hunger Games
I'm the one to blame for fucking up the frame
Of mind of many mimes but might I mind you these are minor things
My aim is to ill instill in the powers that be
The power in me, to move matter with my brain
Powder ain't my name
Money, power, and respect, powder in my

Real nigga shit, she wanna be righteous young rich nigga bitch
Are you a lesbian or a librarian? I know you got room for my dick
Shhh, Tionary in your library then
This ainât a fairy tale, you are not dreaming, that Vitamin C, it is not semen
I'm prestigious, might press up on you-
I'm a fucking scripture nigga we bussin' scripts

If your nose starts bleeding hold your balance (What?)
Balmain bikers, never rode a motorcycle, no denial

(M-M-Maybach Music)
Three bands on my shades
I'm riding round in that nine
My car wash at four
My top down at five
These ho niggas don't count
Them all golds gon' mount
Fake niggas gon' fade
We don't know what that bout
That white girl in that pot, fuck niggas I'm high
(But Nevermind That baby just move your body)
That 45 on my person, quarter keys in my verse
All my shit be rock hard, yo shit so commercial
Master key to these riches
Fuck most of these bitches
Checked half of these niggas
Checking athlete figures
Rest In Peace, Yall niggas done forgot
Now your necks in the noose, see you at the top

<i>[Verse 4 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Something and I pull up and I hop out looking fresh as Zanerobe leather sweats
Fucking bitches in the PH not the PJs (Saudi)
Blow a hundred thousand dollar cheque
Got them goons on deck-
Be quiet, real killers move in silence (they do!)
Them killers they be wyling, them killers they be wyling, yeah
Pop a pill and peel your shit, that's TMI, but that's R and-
