Well I was walkin for some time
When I came across this sign
Sayin "who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come

"No Trespassing" that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

One day I was trippin and that's when I could see
That the ether that I tapped into could be reality
It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind

I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine

Make their faces crack
There's no turnin back
Let's GO!

Hey, ooh ohh

I ain't got BS in my bag
That's the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is glass
Come on baby, can't you see?

I don't need no GPS
To show me where to go
But I can turn into the north pole
And show you what is cold

I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine

Make their faces crack (crack)
There's no turnin back
Let's GO!

I said wait till ya get a load of me!

Ah <i>[x12]</i>

I ain't stayin' at home
I got places to roll
I ain't stayin' at home
No no no

Hey hey hey
Hey yeah yeah yeah!

I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine
