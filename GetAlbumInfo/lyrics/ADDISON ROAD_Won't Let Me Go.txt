Welcome to my latest disaster
Same book just another chapter
I never thought it could be worse than last year
But here I am again today
I laugh âcause it hurts when I scream
But Iâll make it through âcause I believe

That even when my heart breaks
And everythingâs shaken
Iâm left alone in the rain
You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go
When lifeâs insane
And everythingâs crazy
You carry me through the pain
And You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go

Here we go itâs a three-ring circus
Juggling it all, trying to find my purpose
With each new day, Iâm praying just to make it through
When my next disaster is near
I know that youâll meet me right here
So I wonât fear

That even when my heart breaks
And everythingâs shaken
Iâm left alone in the rain
You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go
When lifeâs insane
And everythingâs crazy
You carry me through the pain
And You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go

I feel your love that surrounds me
My world can shake but it wonât drown me
âCause Iâm trusting you
No matter what Iâm going through

That even when my heart breaks
And everythingâs shaken
Iâm left alone in the rain
You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go
When lifeâs insane
And everythingâs crazy
You carry me through the pain
And You wonât, You wonât, wonât
You wonât let me go
