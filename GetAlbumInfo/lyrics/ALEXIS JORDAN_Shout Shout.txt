Hey
Hey
Hey
Ohhh Ohhh
Hey

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Oh, yeah, know that you shine right through my heart
I wanna break you down to pieces, part by part
I wanna serve you up a plate of hater hole
But this platter's gonna be best served cold
And I playin'

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Oooo, boy
See, I gave you a minute just to give you time to breathe
And I'm friendly, but you don't know that I'm the enemy
And I've felt this all inside for much too long
And for all those times I hurt I'm gonna

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come On
Hey

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
For the way you always lied and treated me
Did you forget you're in discretion so easily?
And now my mission is to break your soul in three
'Cause the battle you won, but the war is a different story

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Oooo, boy
See, I gave you a minute just to give you time to breathe
And I'm friendly, but you don't know that I'm the enemy
And I've felt this all inside for much too long
And for all those times I hurt I'm gonna

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come On
So now I'm gonna
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can't do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on, Hey

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
And you'll never know
And I'm when you're taking down your guard
If I could change your mind
I would really love to break your heart
I really wanna (hey)
I'd really love to break your heart
I'm gonna

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come On
Hey
