Now you say you're lonely 
You cried the whole night through 
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river 
I cried a river over you 

Now you say you're sorry 
For being so untrue 
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river 
I cried a river over you 

Now you say you're sorry 
For being so untrue 
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river 
I cried a river over you 

You drove me in and drove me out of my head 
While you never shed a tear 
Remember, I remember all that you said 
You told me love was to come in 
This moment you was, you were...you were 

Now you say you love me 
Well, just to prove you do 
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river 
I cried a river over you 
I cried a river over you 
I cried a river over... 
(yah yah, yeah, yah yah, yeah...)
