I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it get a little cold outside, now baby
I've got the month of May, yeah

Well, I guess that you would say
What in the world make me feel this way?
My girl, you wouldn't believe it but
It's my girl

I've got so much honey, baby
Even the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I guess that you would say
What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
Make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
I love, I love my girl, my girl

I don't need nobody's money shucks
Fortune or fame, you can have it all, baby
'Cause I got all the riches
In my possession, baby
One man could ever claim

Oh, I guess that you would say
What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
Make me feel this way?

My girl, I love my girl
Ooh, my girl
