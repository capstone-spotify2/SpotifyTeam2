Summer moved on
And the way it goes
You can't tag along

Honey moved out
And the way it went
Leaves no doubt

Moments will pass
In the morning light
I found out

Seasons can't last
And there's one thing
Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around

Friendships move on
Until the day
You can't get along

Handshakes unfold
And the way it goes
No one knows

Moments will pass
In the morning light
I found out

Seasons can't last
So there's just one thing
Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
Stay, don't just walk away
With nobody else around

Seasons can't last
And there's just one thing
Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
Stay, don't just walk away
With nobody else around

Summer moved on
