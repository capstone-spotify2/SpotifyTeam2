Hey sugar baby
So hot and tasty
Come on gimme some love you're driving me wild
It's way past midnight
Why don't we take a ride
We'll make some honey as we're cruisin' real slow
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it

I'll be your ladies man
If you give me the chance
We'll keep on jumpin' 'til the music run dry
And if we take a rest
We'll smoke some cigarettes
And start a smokin' goin' out of control
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it

Let's not waste it
We're gonna make it

Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it

Let's not waste it
We're gonna make it

Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it
Let's make it, don't waste it
Let's make it come on and taste it
