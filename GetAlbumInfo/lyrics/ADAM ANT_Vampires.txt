I want your heart
I want your soul
I want everything you hold dear
I want the sinews that bind you together
I know enough is never enough
I want the broad road and 20/20 vision
Your wrist a keyboard of perfume
Money cannot buy
And I'm in a position to say
The camera does not lie
There's a lot of vampires out there
Hanging out to grab your soul
They don't live in Transylvania
They don't live in rock 'n' roll
I want your bones
I want your blood
I want everything you hold dear
I want the sinews that bind you together
I made an educated guess
There's a panic in the lingerie
You know I tremble at each touch
Close my eyes and sigh
Then fly off like a bullet
For the darkside of the sky
I want you pain
I want your pleasure
I want everything you hold dear
I want the sinews that bind you together
I know enough is never enough
Hatcheck to showgirl
Let's to bed madam
I know there's no way out but through together
Wet with sex
Wet with sweat
Embody your body
There's a lot of vampires out there
Hanging out to grab your soul
They don't live in Transylvania
They don't live in rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Vampires
