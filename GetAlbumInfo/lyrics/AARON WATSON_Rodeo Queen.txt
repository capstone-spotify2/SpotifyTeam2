We pull into town try to find the fairgrounds
Park this Cadillac out back behind the loading shoots
Finally made the big show traveling with the rodeo
I'm one of the boys that makes sure nobody pays with their

Life ain't easy for a joker like me
I got a smile painted on my face it's only make believe

She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinkin' when they call for the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt case I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen

Every night the crowd goes wild when they see her ridin'
Shining like a diamond she don't even know my name
I try to turn my feelings off before they load the roughstock
Gotta get my stuff together take a shot and forget how much

Time stands still when the bulls starts spinning
When the bull starts spinning, when the bull starts spinning

She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinkin' when they call for the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt case I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen

And maybe by Telluride
I might work up the nerve to tell her I
Ain't just some fool in a barrel no
There's a real heart beating underneath my
Oversized Wranglers yellow suspenders
I might look like it but I ain't a pretender
No, no

I gotta tell her, I gotta tell her, gotta tell her that

She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinkin' when they call for the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt case I'm not thinking straight

She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinkin' when they call for the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt case I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
