I am contemplating, just stating
No procrastinating, time wasting
Doing what I need, revealing the lies
Smashing the darkness and bringing the fire

I think I've got enough to do in my days
I think I've got enough to do in my days
Doing what I need, revealing the lies
Smashing the darkness and bringing the fire

Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now

Tried to cumulate in, tried saving
Been spending, done craving
Fire up the beast I got in my eyes
Clearing my thoughts, eyes on the price
I think I've got enough to do in my days
I think I've got enough to do in my days
Fire up the beast I got in my eyes
Clearing my thoughts, eyes on the price

I think I've got enough to do in my days
I think I've got enough to do in my days
Doing what I need, revealing the lies
Smashing the darkness and bringing the fire

Bow to get real
So real

Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
Bow to get real
To get real now
