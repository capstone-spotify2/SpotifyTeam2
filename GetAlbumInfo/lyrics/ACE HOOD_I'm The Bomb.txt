<i>[Intro]</i>
Street Certified!
I'm the bomb, motherfucka, I'm the bomb (I'm the bomb)
I'm the bomb, motherfucka, I'm the bomb (I'm the bomb)
Outta time

<i>[Verse]</i>
Yeah
This the grenade flow came to set the bomb on ya (bomb on ya)
Head on 'em, very bright, call me street corner (ow!)
See watch your words 'cause the choppa heat speak coma (yah!)
Hot nigga bitch, Arizona, California (whoo!)
Cash surfin', hit the bank like cowabunga (cowabunga)
Every summer make it rain while you just thunder 
Baby, I do numbers, 28 red Hummers 
Never played the band, Mac 11 hand drummer 
He ain't sayin' nothin', clean hundred seen comin' 
You think he seen somethin', bullets got 'em mean muggin'
Got his whole team swearin' they ain't seen nothin'
A lot of sound, get yo baby mother face busted
The feds want him but that Lamborghini speed on 'em (vroom!)
Call the Fettucini, swag on the tag homie (tag homie)
Mr. Miyagi flow, kickin' down the damn door (b-bow!)
Hot diamonds on the wrist, call it Hellfroze
An animal, I'm eatin' niggas like Hannibal
I'm 'bout to blow, when I land, call me cannonball
I'm rappin' circles 'round these Urkels, they in metapause (metapause?)
We never fall, tell these haters grow a set of balls
So i can shoot 'em in and luck can play the cheddar ball (huh?)
You cross that water into Florida, welcome to the Mob (yeah?)
You see that Broward County, border pedder, or the guys (huh?)
'Cause we eat niggas, sweet potatoe ass pie
Ask the last guy, turn him into mascots
Them bullets smash out, squeeze into the last round
And all hands down, better be a man down
We ain't trippin', bury him into a sand pile
I'm a land mine, better watch the damn ground (bow!)
Ha! Yeah! So what you motherfuckers sayin' now? (sayin now)
He the next, yeah the best, bitch hands down (down)

<i>[Outro]</i>
I'm the bomb, motherfucka, I'm the bomb (I'm the bomb)
I'm the bomb, motherfucka, I'm the bomb (I'm the bomb)
Tick, tick, bow!
Outta time
