He met her in the fall of '93 in the hills of Tennessee
She was barely 17, he was tall and strong and lean
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon

And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On a hillside all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song

She married in her mama's wedding gown
Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light

And she'd sing a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On the front porch all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song

They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Said "God don't take my love from me"

Just let her sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Like she has all along
And I'll dance with her till dawn
On a hill side all alone

And we'll spend eternity like a mountain melody
In love as we can be
Singing that blue ridge song

Now he lives there all alone
In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void (?)
From the absence of her voice

And he lays down every night
Dreams about that front porch light
Where she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night until dawn
On the hillside all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song

Little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ride mountain song
Little blue ridge mountain song
