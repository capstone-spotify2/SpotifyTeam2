It's the weekend, anything can happen
Anything can happen tonight
Feel the space with cosmic revelation
Let our bodies go on and fly

And just surrender
Live forever
It's all ours tonight

A million stars light up the night
The constellations give me life
And heaven's boulevard it's shinin'
I'm givin' in, and let it go
The constellations fill my soul
Our hearts beats are on zero gravity

This is our world, decorate the dancefloor
Through a new dimension we go
Supernatural, love and take it shout out
Losin' in a sky full of gold

And just surrender
Live forever
Is all ours tonight

A million stars light up the night
The constellations give me life
And heaven's boulevard it's shinin'
I'm givin' in, and let in go
The constellations fill my soul
Our hearts beats are on zero gravity

I can fly <i>[x5]</i>

A million stars light up the night
The constellations give me life
And heaven's boulevard it's shinin'
I'm givin' in, and let in go
The constellations fill my soul
Our hearts beats are on zero gravity
