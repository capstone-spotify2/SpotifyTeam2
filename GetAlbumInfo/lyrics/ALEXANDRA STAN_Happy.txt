I just have this feeling
I have this feeling it's gonna be alright
And I just can't believe it
That you're here with me tonight

One look in your eyes and it was over
Caught me by surprise, I got ran over
One look in your eyes and it was over
It was over, it was over

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
Don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY

I know that you see me
And now you see me in the bed light
And I just can't believe it
That you're here with me tonight

One look in your eyes and it was over
Caught me by surprise, I got ran over
One look in your eyes and it was over
It was over, it was over

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
Don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
Don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY
You make me HAPPY, you make me HAPPY
All I need is your love to make me HAPPY

I just have this feeling
I have this feeling it's gonna be alright
