Sun is back
No lanes in the way I go

Flames blow away
And memories
Out the smoke

And now
It's time
For miles
And miles

And I'll be going until I just run
Out the road

If you're looking for me
I'll be in the land of the free
Nobody there's guilty

By the time you know
That you look go
How we know, know, know, know
In Mexico

Sun is back
No lanes in the way I go

Flames blow away
And memories
Out the smoke

And now
It's time
For miles
And miles

And I'll be going until I just run
Out the road

If you're looking for me
I'll be in the land of the free
Nobody there's guilty

By the time you know
That you look go
How we know, know, know, know
In Mexico
