Oh yeah
Come on!

Our skins lay upon the floor
We've made it before we make it through the door
She's got a monster appetite
You keep me hot through the cold night

All out of air, but I just don't care, 'cause
I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been
Rocked like this

You make me forget my past
There's no way I could ever go back
My heart explodes in my chest
I've had the best, now I want the rest

All out of air, but I just don't care, 'cause
I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been

Never been
Rocked like this

Oh, come on

'Cause I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been rocked like this (rocked like this)
No, I've never been
Rocked like this
Rocked like this
Rocked like this
Never been rocked like this
Never been rocked like this
No, I've never been rocked like this
