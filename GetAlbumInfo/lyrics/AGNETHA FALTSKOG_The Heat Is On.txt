Tropical summer, balmy day
Sit around you haven't much to say
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.

You know you're in the hands of fate
Now you've gone and found me you appreciate
That the heat is on,
The heat is on.

You're on the road to Mandalay
Never gonna make it try another day
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.

Temperature is rising to fever pitch
Sun is getting closer we all get rich
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.

Hot pants and feet
Can't believe the madness sure feels sweet
The heat is on,
Heat is on.

Sun sun sun dazzle,
Sun sun sun dazzle,
Go wild, gonna rattle
When the heat is on.

Tropical Summer balmy day
Don't say much, ain't much to say
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.

The heat is on, the heat is on,
The heat is on, the heat is on.

Hot pants and feet
Sure be sweet
The heat is on,
Daddy yeah...the heat is on.

Tropical Summer balmy day...
The heat is on...
You're on the road to Mandalay
Never gonna make it try another day
The heat is on,
Temperature is rising to fever pitch....
