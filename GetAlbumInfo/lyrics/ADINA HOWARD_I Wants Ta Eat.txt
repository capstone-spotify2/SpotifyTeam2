<i>[Male Voice:]</i>
Welcome to Ch' Miguel 
Will we be starting with cocktail today? 

<i>[Male Voice 2:]</i>
Uh, yes. I'd like the bottle of Don Perrignon. 
Some Belugio Caviar. And for the main course 
We'll have the Peking Duck alaroux and the stuffed artichoke. 

<i>[Adina:]</i>
Peakin' Duck? I don't want no duck! Give me some pig! 
Pig's Feet! And how much y'all greens cost? 
And wit' dat I want some O.E., a'ight?
