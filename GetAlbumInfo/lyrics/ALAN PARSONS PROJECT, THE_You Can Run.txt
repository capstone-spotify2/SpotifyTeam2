I Know You're Out There
Cuz I Can Feel Ya
Yeah I Can Feel Ya Trying To Pull Me Down
I Know Your Kind
You Kinda Like It
When People Tell Ya Not To Come Around
Here's Looking At Ya
Been Nice To Know Ya
I See The Lines Written On Your Face
I Wish You Well
But I Gotta Tell Ya
Ain't Nothing Human 'Bout The Human Race

You Can Run
But You Can't Look Behind You
You Can Hide
But The Truth's Gonna Find You

Some People Fight It Like Some Disease
They Carry Secrets To An Early Grave
They Try To Fake It
While On Their Knees
Never Knowing What They Really Crave
They Got No Values
They Got No Soul
No Sense Of Purpose
Nothing To Believe
Call Me Your Friend
Then Steal Me Blind
To Me You're Nothing But A Common Thief

You Can Run
But You Can't Look Behind
You You Can Hide
But The Truth's Gonna Find You
