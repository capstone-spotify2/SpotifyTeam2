It goes on every day,
it's on my mind,

<i>[Carter:]</i>
It's like I'm in a war, never runnin' for the hills,
Fighting against the corporate, only in it for the bills,
Get picked young to make a quote "sick song,
"Wrote to fit any beat he'll put on,
Auto tune that and put effects this,
Make you sound like a robot sucking a dick,
Ha, got offered to lose creativity,
To be living with money infinity,
That don't sit well with me

<i>[Dave:]</i>
Music is my vitamin,
I'm losing time and time again,
But something brings me back on top,
Just bring me the light,
I'm at a place where the darkness keeps me alive,
But I feel alright,
Just need a sun to shine down on me,

<i>[Carter:]</i>
Still shootin' but I've run outta ammo,
I'm an animal, hands are full, I'll eat anyone, not a cannibal,
No hand signs, or coke lines, or bad dimes,
Without that shit, I can make it to the top fine,
Fire, like stop, drop, and roll,
Whip out the Flip get that shit on record,
Laughing at our moment yeah you say you want more,
Sober and I'm over getting hold up in the fray again

<i>[Dave:]</i>
Hopin' for the best,
lucky I'm alive
