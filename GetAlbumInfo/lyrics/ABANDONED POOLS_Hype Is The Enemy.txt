There's no use in crying over
All that should have, would have, could have been
Find I'm better off now anyway
With you here in the end
There's one thing I can say for sure
So great, so ordinary
Hype is the enemy of everything that's beautiful
A trap for fools of miracles
Illuminate the broken hearted

Take over
A little bit bolder
My shouted words don't make a sound
A day older
A little bit bolder
In shadows living underground
Take over
A little bit bolder
Move forward see what life will bring
A day older
A little bit bolder
In silence love is raining down

When I twist and turn the puzzle
Flip it up and over on it's end
When I turn it inside out
I always find you at the end
But I could be over-thinking this
Am I still just trying too hard?
Hype is the enemy of everything that's beautiful
A trap for fools of miracles
Illuminate the broken hearted

Take over
A little bit bolder
My shouted words don't make a sound
A day older
A little bit bolder
In shadows living underground
Take over
A little bit bolder
Move forward see what life will bring
A day older
A little bit bolder
In silence love is raining down
