Monday mourning
Tears are falling
Down like fluid pain
And it's a long
Lost Monday morning

The telling words
I like to learn
Are dying on your lips
As the morning
Through my fingers slips

I find myself in times like this
Quite amazed
How eager everything is to go wrong
Around me

Monday mourning
Tries to wound me
Eyes look hurt again
For have I asked
And will never ask again
For I have asked
I will never ask again
