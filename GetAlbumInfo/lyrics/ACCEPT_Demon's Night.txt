Sparks - the eyes of fire
Flying high in the night
Storms - the arms of evil
It's gonna take your life

You know the bats crying
Hell bent for the death
Rain - the tears of the devil
Gonna lay you to rest

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

You - you've lost your freedom
To the masters of force
Ride on the waves of magic
Dark nights will be your course

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night - a night to die

Lights - blinding your mind
Like a flash out of hell
Sounds - that no one will hear
It's a demon's bell

Look in the face of horror
It's a dangerous night
Scream for your mother's children
You've lost your human right

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night - a night to die

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night

A night to die
