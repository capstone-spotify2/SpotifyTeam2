Why should I fall in love
Turn my world upside down
One broken heart is quite enough
Why should I fall in love

Why should I hold your hand
Feel my hopes start to rise
It's a long way down and I can't fly
Why should I fall in love

Why should I hold you
Why should I dream
I know myself, I'll just take it to extremes

I want to keep you my whole life through
If you've got no one, least you've got no one to lose

Why should I fall in love
Wake up tomorrow with a smile
I want the kind that lasts awhile
Why should I fall in love
Tell me baby

Why should I hold you
Why should I dream
I know myself, I'll just take it to extremes
I wanna keep you my whole life through
But if you've got no one, least you've got no one to lose

Why should I fall in love
Turn my life inside out
One broken heart is quite enough
Why should I fall in love

This old heart has had it rough
Why should I fall in love
