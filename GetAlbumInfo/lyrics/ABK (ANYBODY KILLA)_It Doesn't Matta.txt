<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
It doesn't matter what you say anymore, 
Things you do don't amaze me 
so, now I see you like you passed on 
Don't nothing last long, shit ain't forever 
Whatever you thinkin' of, 
there's always something ten times better 
Don't mean to bust your bubble, sink your boat 
But if you dive in, and can't swim, you ain't gonna float 
It's like, some people try as hard as they can 
to fit in a situation they don't understand 
Confused and fed up and don't know what else to do 
Until they get mad enough and come after you 
I wanna, take this time to figure out what I'm all about 
Should I do 'em in, or just chill and shut my mouth 
God forgive me for this evil takin' over 
But there's situations I won't understand until I'm older 
Gotta, live my life through these twists and turns 
And it doesn't matter cause I'm always down to learn 
It doesn't matter! 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames 

<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
Different lifestyle, new face each day 
Unplug yo' mind with words I say 
No choice don't move, think hard what's next 
Didn't respond quick enough, ain't no time left 
And if there was it wouldn't matter, 
Nothing matters where I'm from 
Center of the earth with the worms and scum 
Ya don't want none of this bitch, keep on steppin' 
All that drama that you bring with your mouth as a weapon 
Ain't no one ever told you talkin' shit don't pay 
The only thing that you get is the killa in your hallway 
Lookin' to revert everything that you said 
Turnin' your whole room red, bloody carpet, the bed 
I can see a lot clearer now, than where I'm headed 
There is no hate, do or die, 
To try and keep my head straight 
The more you think about me the sadder you're gonna get 
But now it's done and over, so I guess it doesn't matter 
Bitch! 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames 

<i>[Colton Grundy]</i>
I know that they don't like and it don't matter none 
I'mma keep actin' a fool, reppin' the shotgun 
Somebody come and kill me, nothin' else seems to work 
Got me jabbin' this pen in my heart for every perk 
With my blood on it, I'm bleedin' on the track 
You can hear me lose a lung if you listen to the playback 
It don't matter, cause nobody's listenin' 
I am, start to finish, bitch, peep the manuscripts 
Ya see, if where I'm from, from the pigs where we lived 
When we buckin' at the precinct and the judge from the jail 
Throwin' the hatchet up with ABK and the fam 
Rockin' throwbacks Psychopathic, where it all began 
It don't matter how I got here or where I come from 
I still be standing in the aftermath of devastation 
Fuck everybody who don't wanna hear me 
Maybe it's what I say and portray is why they fear me 
It doesn't matter 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames
