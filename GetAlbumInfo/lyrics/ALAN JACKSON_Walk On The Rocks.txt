After seventeen years behind bars
And lookin' back on his mistakes
He sat down and poured out his heart
When his son came to see him today

He spoke with a voice that trembled
Tryin' to hold back the tears
He said I ain't been much of a father
Son, I wish I could turn back the years

'Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin' stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on

He said son stay away from the bottle
Watch out for the company you keep
And hold on to those you love
'Cause love is a man's greatest need

The right way may not be easy
The right road ain't always straight
Son, please don't follow the footsteps
That lead to where I am today

'Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin' stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on

Walk on the rocks that I stumbled on
