Our father
Which art in heaven.
Hollowed would be thy name
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day, our daily bread

And forgive our debts
As we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power, and the glory.
Forever and ever. amen.
