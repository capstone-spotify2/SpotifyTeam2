Build your ship, letâs go out
In the wilderness weâll run wild
Itâs so cold but you know we belong here
Shout to the sky and a fire to keep us warm here
Build your ship, move down south
In the wilderness weâll run wild
Itâs so cold but you know we belong here
When we escape to that place weâll be home, dear
Itâs so cold but you know we belong here
Shout to the sky, and a fire to keep us warm here
