<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I've got the mental of a bad lieutenant,
We gamble, drug money, river boats, Cadillacs talkin' 'bout a prison know
Lemons that's as subtle, in the fish they caught it cuddle
We grew up in the gutta, breaking jaws like a huddle.
Morey boogie boards wax the top so we stay on.
Wrist wrap is pitch black, three sixty shades on.
I won't stop until the walls got Monet's drawn,
The farm land enough of animals to graze on.
I'm always smoking on the potent straight from Oakland.
I'm rising like a souffle, you know you got to serve it quick.
Just dust me off with cheese, pussy straight from Persia, bitch.
They'll find you lake in Maine, you taught so well the Jersey snitch.
I rock the lenses Cam and Nitty wore
I roll a fifty of the dowa to the neck and take a city tour.
And this shine got the salsa and the gritty raw,
Timeless, my mother's diamond's 1954.

<i>[Hook x2:]</i>
I gotta get that dough, I want the beamer with the racing seats.
Pound the ground with my feet to make the pavement speak.
And tell me secrets that she's never told a soul to
The price of living your decisions can control you.

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I sign my name like a mantle never stickin' to the script,
Be like people off the boat, seven languages of shit.
Big tradition to the street, get you lifted off your feet.
Like my daughter at the pub, no taking orders after dark.
Cause they expect it, so wake up early, hop off the shitter,
Employ a lawyer, that's been Barmitzvah'd.
Never trust the golim seem me sippin' sprinter, hookers with spintza
And Mister Wedge, thirty dollar's holla never tip her.
This conversation that be building in the weed jar is bothersome
Half of my leg covered with Robinsons.
The firm gully in this dutch, me and Steel smoking.
Cheerleaders, pretty bitches getting peeled open.

<i>[Hookx2:]</i>
I gotta get that dough, I want the beamer with the racing seats.
Pound the ground with my feet to make the pavement speak.
And tell me secrets that she's never told a soul to
The price of living your decisions can control you.
