No more frustration let's relax
Give me every pleasure to the max
Surrender all your kisses and don't hold back

(You gotta) Love me right
I need your loving tonight
So just love me right
And satisfy my appetite... Don't Bite

Touch me like you touch your little teddy bear
Give me satisfaction till I just don't care

(You gotta) Love me right
I need your loving tonight
So just love me right
And satisfy my appetite... Don't Bite

Surrender...
Surrender...
Surrender...
Surrender to me!
