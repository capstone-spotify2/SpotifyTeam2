<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home

I hear the voice my sweet momma called me
Telling me to change my ways
In my mind, I smell the dogwood blooming
Takes me back to yesterday

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I left behind the person that I once was
I changed for good and some for bad
I've wasted days and nights on love forgotten
I've traded happiness for sad

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I've felt the hurt of a broken heart inside me
I've felt the joy of love unchained
I've seen the rain wash away a mountain
Like tears have washed away my pain

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I've watched some loved ones dear to my heart dying
I've heard a newborn baby's cry
I've walked a path of glory and of darkness
I've felt the guilt of a senseless life

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Drank to forget and I've drank to remember
And I've drank for love and I've drank for hate
I've danced alone with a full moon up above me
Lighting the way to heaven's gate

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I've felt the love of Jesus shining on me
I've felt the devil's wicked ways
Prayed for forgiveness, prayed for redemption
Prayed just to make it through the day

<i>[Chorus]</i>
