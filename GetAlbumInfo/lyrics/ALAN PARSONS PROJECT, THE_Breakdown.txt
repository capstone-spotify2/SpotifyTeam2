I breakdown in the middle and lose my thread.
No one can understand a word that I say.
When I breakdown just a little and lose my head,
Nothing I try to do can work the same way.

Any time it happened, I'd get over it
With a little help from all my friends.
Anybody else could see what's wrong with me,
But they walk away and just pretend...

When I breakdown.

I breakdown in the middle and lose my thread.
No one can understand a word that I say.
When I breakdown just a little and lose my head,
Nothing I try to do can work the same way.

Where are all the friends who used to talk to me?
All they ever told me was good news...
People that I've never seen are kind to me,
Is it any wonder I'm confused?

When I breakdown...When I breakdown...

Freedom, freedom, we will not obey.
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away.
Take the wall away.
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey.
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away.
Where are all my friends?
I'm so confused..
