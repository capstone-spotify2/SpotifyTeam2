Hey little miss sweet surprise
With your big brown eyes
You know you're foolin' me

I savor that your disguise
When you make me rise
It's how you move
And the noises that you make
And the way you take control
Not like you all the things you do
You got me falling

Is it more or is it less?
Is it love or is it sex?
So much more or so much less?
Is it love or is it?

I know you like what's on my mind
Know it's killing you this time
I can feel when we go there
That you like when I'm inside
You know you want what's on my mind
And it's killing me this time
Situation starting over
And you like when I'm inside

Hey little sweet sunrise
With your bedroom eyes
When you look up at me
Baby you live a lie
When you take your time
It's how you move

Is it more or is it less?
Is it love or is it sex?
So much more or so much less?
Is it love or is it?

I know you like what's on my mind
Know it's killing you this time
I can feel when we go there
That you like when I'm inside
You know you want what's on my mind
And it's killing me this time
Situation starting over
And you like when I'm inside

Ohhhh, it kills you inside
Kills you inside
It kills you inside

I know you like what's on my mind
Know it's killing you this time
I can feel when we go there
That you like when I'm inside
You know you want what's on my mind
And it's killing me this time
Situation starting over
And you like when I'm inside
