Yeah... yeaaah

You found a soldier
But I'm a man of peace
I'll fight for your love
They train to take it from me
Then protect your heart so you'll never be hurt again
But it's a sacrifice cause I'm an old fashion working man
Which means I won't be home like I use to
On the phone like I use to
Won't be long for I see you too, yeah
We live life with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
And was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live
And you held me down for years
The hardest part for me out here is when you cry
I'm not there to wipe your tears

So baby don't breakdown, hold me now, I need your love to
Make it back home, I don't know how I'll do without you
So baby don't breakdown, hold me now, I need your love to
Make it back home, I don't know how I'll do without you
Without you, I'll do without you <i>[x4]</i>

Can't do without your love, your love, your love
Can't do without your love

I know you hear the rumors, I know you hear the lies
I know you hear that I'm no different from all these other guys
I wanna come home sooner
To make you realize, that life's just a contest and you happen to be my prize... yeaaah
We live life with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
And was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live
And you held me down for years
The hardest part for me out here is when you cry
I'm not there to wipe your tears

So baby don't breakdown, hold me now, I need your love to
Make it back home, I don't know how I'll do with out you
So baby don't breakdown, hold me now, I need your love to
Make it back home, I don't know how I'll do without you
Without you, I'll do without you <i>[x4]</i>

Can't do without your love <i>[x3]</i>
