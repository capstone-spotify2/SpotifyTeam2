It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya, honey, how I feel
I've been dreaming
Floatin' downstream and
Losin' touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where ya been
You been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with Mama Kin

Well, you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

It ain't easy, livin' like you wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for you dad is just a drag, man
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea

It ain't easy, livin' like ya wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for your dad is just a drag, man
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
I said I tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
