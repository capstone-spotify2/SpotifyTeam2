On the boulevard where broken dreams
Breathe on the covers of my magazines
And the rats pay homage to the local sleaze
Before they bleed them dry

There goes crazy Jean
She's got electric eyes
From the trackbox running up and down her thighs
An ole' skinny boy he just looks outside and screams
Hey you Puerto-Rican

Fast cars
(Fast cars)
Fast living
(Fast cars)
What happened to my world?

This ain't gonna love
This ain't love
This is being a knight in the modern world
Living in hate in the modern world
Ain't no black or white in the modern world
Just you and me babe, in the modern world

Well the mayor's hobby is doing crack
While the homeless go hungry right out back
And those union boys down on Bentno street
Wouldn't know how to stack those cards
And there's a trump card dealing in stocks and wives
When the maple tree keeps 'em warm tonight
See the apple rot watch the bugs they crawl
On the steps of the Taj Mahal

Cheap crime
(Big crime)
And lives
(No time)
What happened to my world?

This ain't gonna love
This ain't love
Yeah this is life and death in the modern world
This is what you get in the modern world
And you better bet that in a modern world
It's you and me babe,
Just you and me babe,
in the modern world

Where there's nowhere to run to
The modern world
Better get your gun
Hey!
Hey!

Yeah, it's a jungle out there
Hey!

Well there's no tomorrow, but we got tonight
I have to trade my blade for a thunder fight
I was much too young for your Vietnam
But there's a war going on in my homeland

(This ain't love)
(Well this ain't love)
Well it's dog eat dog in the modern world
Live and die in the modern world
There's no way to sense it in the modern world
It's you and me in the modern world
Only heroes die in the modern world
No one cries in the modern world
And you gotta fight in the modern world
Cause it's you and me babe
You and me baby
You and me babe
in the modern world
