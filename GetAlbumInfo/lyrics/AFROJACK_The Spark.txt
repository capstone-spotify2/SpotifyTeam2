<i>[Intro:]</i>
A little bit of misfit dancing
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine coming out
The mind of this midnight rambler

<i>[Verse:]</i>
I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Ever think you if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show you're alive
Everything is gonna be alright.

<i>[Chorus â part 1:]</i>
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm telling everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

<i>[Chorus â part 2:]</i>
Taking back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

<i>[Verse:]</i>
They say if you look around for something hard enough
And you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down
But shawty don't be blinded
Hey, feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Ever think that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cause it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright,.

<i>[Chorus â part 1:]</i>
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm telling everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

<i>[Chorus â part 2:]</i>
Taking back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I'mma feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the thing much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well, well maybe tonight

<i>[Chorus â part 1:]</i>
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm telling everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

<i>[Chorus â part 2:]</i>
Taking back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
