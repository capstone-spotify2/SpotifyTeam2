I been to the left
I been to the right
I found myself in Abu Dadi just a mirage in the night
Been to the high
I been to the low
An' I been to lots a places that I didn't wanna go
But I ain't seen nothin' to get me off my ass
I laughed at all the jokers wanna make me walk on glass
I could walk
'for I could crawl
An' I was meaner than a bad dog with his back against the wall
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call
Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Meanstreak
They call me meanstreak

I just don't
Who I wanna be
The count of Monte Cristo or the Sheik of Arabi
I've eaten rich
'an I've eaten free
I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty
An' I ain't met no one who told me I got class
Say never feed the animal the boys got to much flash
I'm the guy
They just can't teach
And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy they call

What's your name
Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Runnin' down my back
I got a meanstreak
Wanna feel the meanstreak
They call me meanstreak
Meanstreak
What's my name

Meanstreak
