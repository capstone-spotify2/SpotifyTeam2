On this magic road I'm about to lose control
Oh, won't you bless my soul on this magic road
Down this magic road you can have anything you want
And leave out things you don't on this magic road

What is this I see? What a mystery
What a time to meet, baby

On this magic road smile is the down side
But don't you ever close your eyes on this magic road
On this magic road you can even drive my car
You can even be a superstar on this magic road

What is this I see? Oh my, my, my, my
What a mystery, what a time to meet
On this magic road, on this magic road
On this magic road

You can even drive my car, oh
You can even be a suitor or lawyer
Just know who, we know who you are

What is this I see? What a mystery
Sure to find life's ecstasy

On this magic road nothing's impossible
You can depend on me, keep saying
On this magic, magic, road, yeah
On this magic road, if you turn on and off the bulb
On this magic road, on this magic road

You can have a big bank account
(On this magic road)
You can see the old they're comin' here
Hey watch out, watch out for the little man in the corner

On this magic road
You can be anything that you wanna be
But hey, hey, watch out for the little man
(On this magic road)

They don't have what you have
Watch out for the poor man
They don't have what what you're having

You got a bigger house and a Mercedes, big brother
(On this magic road)
But you hanging around in a Volkswagen
(On this magic road)

On this magic road
Remember what's happening, agony
Slavery, agony trauma with <i>[?]</i>
(On this magic road)

See the little children, yeah, yeah, yeah
(On this magic road)
