I opened my heart, gave you a home
I built you up a temple to keep you safe and warm
But under the sand you became stone
And I couldn't carry all the weight
You crushed me to the bone
So goodbye, goodbye...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm walking away
Said all I can say
Today is the day
I put in my time
Now I'm drawing the line
Today is the day

Well, look at my soul, you're bleeding me dry
Like a thousand stars falling down
There's no more tears to cry
Well, even when I walk with you it's just a crawl
Down on my knees, I'm begging please
Baby don't take me all
So goodbye, goodbye...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

But can you tell me why it's gotta be so hard
Can you tell me why it's gotta be
So hard, hard to leave
To leave... to leave... to leave

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Can you tell me, why it's gotta be
So hard, hard to leave
