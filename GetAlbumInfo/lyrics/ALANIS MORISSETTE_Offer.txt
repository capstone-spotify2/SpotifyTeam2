Who 
Who am I to be blue 
Look at my family and fortune 
Look at my friends and my house 
Who 
Who am i to feel deadend 
Who am i to feel spent 
Look at my health and my money 
And where 
Where do i go to feel good 
Why do i still look outside me 
When clearly i've seen it won't work 
Is it my calling to keep on when i'm unable 
And is it my job to be selfless extraodinairre 
And my generosity has me disabled 
By this my sense of duty to offer 
And why 
Why do i feel so ungrateful 
Me who is far beyond survival 
Me who see life as an oyster 
Is it my calling to keep on when i'm unable 
And is it my job to be selfless extraodinairre 
And my generosity has me disabled 
By this my sense of duty to offer 
And how 
How dare i rest on my laurels 
How dare i ignore an outstreched hand 
How dare i ignore a third world country 
Is it my calling to keep on when i'm unable 
And is it my job to be selfless extraodinairre 
And my generosity has me disabled 
By this my sense of duty to offer 
Who 
Who am i to be woo
