Lose me, do you see me?
Round and round once more
I do adore you

Are you beneath me? I see you
Release me, pain's a bore
But you live inside me
Feel it once again

When I know you're hurting know your selfish ways
Wont you risk yourself for me, cos I'm an unwanted release
Release,
Are you
Feeling once again

You bruised me, I felt you leave
Not my fault that I fell so hard onto you
Did I scare you?
Are you my phantom girl?
When I see you I ache
When I feel you await
Have u heard I adore you

I feel it once again
And I know you're hurting, know your selfish way
Won't you risk yourself for me? Cos I'm an unwanted release
Release
Are you

Are you? 
Are you?
Living safe and sound
Try and lay you down
Cos i can't get around
I feel it once again
And I know you're hurting know your selfish way
Wont you risk yourself for me cos I'm an unwanted release
Release
Are you?

Lose me,
Do you,
See me?
