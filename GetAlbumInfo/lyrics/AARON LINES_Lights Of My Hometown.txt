They're not really expecting me
But I know where they hide the key, under the welcome mat
There's no better place than that
Don't know how long I've been gone
All I know is it's been too long and I'm off track
That's why I'm coming back
When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown

The static is almost gone
From the station I grew up on
I'm getting closer now
So I turn it up real loud

Funny how a little thing like that
Can make it all come rushing back
They say it's not the same
But to me it will never change

When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown

I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown
