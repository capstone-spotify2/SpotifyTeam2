Killin it

If they wanna shoot me down
Think I must be killin it killin it killin it
They want me dead right now
That means I must be livin it livin it livin it
I hear 'em screaming out my name
Argue this down
They said they wanna shoot me down
I guess I must be killin it killin it killin it

Think about it before you jump deep
I know that you wanna leave here in one piece
Everything I got they wanna take it from me
That's when jealousy turns into envy
Well I can't let you do that hoodoo 
I go too hard for it each and everyday
I known just what they want
I know what they gon' say
Just because I did it my way
(They wanna...they wanna)

They wanna shoot me down
Think I must be killin it killin it killin it
They want me dead right now
That means I must be livin it livin it livin it
I hear 'em screaming out my name
All through this down
They said they wanna shoot me down
I guess I must be killin it killin it killin it

Akon...the saga continues
Konvict music
I'm the reason why they wantin pop pop
No intoxicating but they want a big shot
Looking at my large things, What they ain't got
Let's go play,  I got money in the pot
Make that drama come I bring that drum drum drum hey
Make that things go,  I'll let 'em run run run hae
My enemies wanna see me down down down
But I'm sittin on top of the song

So you know they wanna
Shoot me down
Think I must be killin it killin it killiin it
They want me dead right now
That means I must be livin it livin it livin it
I hear 'em screaming out my name
All through this down
They said they wanna shoot me down
I guess I must be killin it killin it killin it

Ooahaa Akon Ooahaa the saga continues

So who I heard them say, but I don't know nothing that day
From were I'm sittin now the grass is greener than they catch
The more they talk, the more I rise my glass
They hatin me, they celebrating

If they wanna shoot me down
Think I must be killin it killin it killin it
They want me dead right now
That means I must be livin it livin it livin it
I hear 'em screaming out my name
All through this down
They said they wanna shoot me down
I guess I must be killin it killin it killin it
