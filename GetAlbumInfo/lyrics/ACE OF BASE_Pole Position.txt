Huh!
Pole position, push a little harder
Hey now, life is every minute
All or nothing
Living on the limits
Hey now, I'll race you to the finish

All or nothing, lost in time
You're flashing through my mind
Pole position's teasing me
I cannot see the light

Last night, on my way to nowhere
Looking for a lover that night
Same night from that very nowhere
You turned out the love of my life

Fast feelings took over me
Always wanted to be in

Pole position, push a little harder
Hey now, life is every minute
All or nothing
Living on the limits
Hey now (hey now)
I'll race you to the finish

Life is every minute
Living on the limit
Push a little harder to play
Push a little harder to play

Life is every minute
Living on the limit
Push a little harder to play
Push a little harder to play

Push a little harder to play

Now you tease my fantasy
It's a bitter sweet memory
I belong to you, talk, talk

Pole position, push a little harder
Hey now, life is every minute
All or nothing
Living on the limits
Hey now, I'll race you to the finish

Pole position's driven me
To be faster than the sound (pole position)
Pole position's killing me
I cannot see the light

Pole position, push a little harder (push a little harder)
Hey now, life is every minute (all or nothing)
All or nothing
Living on the limits (hey now)
Hey now, I'll race you to the finish a-ah.
Pole position, push a little harder
Hey now, life is every minute
All or nothing
Living on the limits (push a little harder today)
Hey now, I'll race you to the finish (a-ah)
