Always been the prophets
Who make the world evolve
Always been the average breaking it down
Majority, the unknown
Giving us the rules
It's more than luck to get the standard
You'll never find me
Like you hope that I am
You'll never treat me like you think you can
Be always independent
Surrendering no way
I won't deal with crimes of society
Now, if you hate it
You gonna fight it back
Just try to change it
Fight it, fight it back
Find myself in crisis
Get near to collapse
Am I forced to live that boring life
God, I hate the average
Go and nuke it out
Go, piss the accepted, screw them all
Now, if you hate it
You gonna fight it back
Just try to change it
Fight it, fight it back
Now, if you hate it
