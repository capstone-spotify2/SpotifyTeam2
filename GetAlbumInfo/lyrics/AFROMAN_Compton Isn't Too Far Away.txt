When I was young we wanted to get out the ghetto
But after we moved out of the ghetto
It was hard to get things we needed

I took a picture in the hood
Standing by the door
White T shirt and black khakis
Sagging kind of low
I see the corner that I worked
With my homies in the back
LAPD searching us
Looking for some crack

I don't need to be the king of the world
All I need is some activator
For my Jehri curl

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say

We move from South Central
To the desert of the real high
Palmdale-Lancaster
Blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
The sheriff harasses me
He puts me in the choke hold
So bad I can barely breath

I'm the hungry hustler Afroman
I'm going parking lot platinum in my Astrovan

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say
I'm selling yay

I see police lights
On palmdale boulevard
Back-up units pulling up
I'm thinking oh my god
I got nowhere else to go
My hands are in the air
I don't know what to do
But you can't have my weed and my brew
