Just laid it all out on the line
Too late to take it back this time
The silence here is deafening
So afraid of what sheâs thinking
Did I just scare her off or make her mine?

Her beautiful eyes just keep on looking at me
And time stood still
Iâm starting to understand eternity
How does she feel?
Will she laugh and maybe call me crazy?
Say adios, goodbye baby
Please god let her love me, give me a sign
And then she cried, then she cried

When that first teardrop hit the floor
Iâd swore that girl was out the door
Did she just smile or is that me hoping?
Iâm about to die right here not knowing
What on earth could she be waiting for?

Her beautiful eyes just keep on looking at me
And time stood still
Iâm starting to understand eternity
How does she feel?
Would she laugh and maybe call me crazy?
Say adios, goodbye baby
Please god let her love me, give me a sign
And then she cried

Happy tears fell like rain
She said Iâve been so afraid
That you might not feel the same way

Then she laughed and she called me crazy
She said what took you so long baby?
Donât you know Iâve been waiting all my life?
Then she cried, then she cried, then she cried
