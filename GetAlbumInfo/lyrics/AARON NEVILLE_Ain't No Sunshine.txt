Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away

And I know

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone?
I wonder if she's gone to stay?
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

And I know

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And everybody knows this house just ain't no home
