Don't you know I want you? Don't feel bad
It's the best problem that I ever had
Don't you know your love, it could be mine
'Cause I really waited for a mighty long time

And I think it'll be alright
Another day, another day
And I think it'll be alright
Another day yeah

Don't you know this loving is not for free
Thinking someone else and I'm thinking about me
Oh, my baby, don't you go away, yeah
Saving my loving for another day

And I think it'll be alright
If you check with me tomorrow and I
And I think I'll be aright
Another day, another day

And I think got to give it little time now
Another day
And I think, everything will be alright
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow

And I think it'll be alright
Feels pretty good here
And I think soon will be alright
Another day, hey, hey

And I think, oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, hey, don't bother
And I think gonna be alright
Love me, love me, love
Put your arms around me

And I think
Hold me tight here tonight
Just right
And I think
Every thing's gonna be alright
