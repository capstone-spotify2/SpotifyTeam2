Driving through hell just to get back home
I can't find the way there's too much smoke
I'm choking on the air that I breathe
I can't turn around coz I'm in too deep

I'm in a Hellfire
It's better to die young
I'm in a Hellfire
It's better to die young 

With driving wheels I was born to ride
straight outta hell and to the other side
I don't give a damn about the big boss man
for all I care he can kiss my arse

With driving wheels
I was born to ride 
straight outta hell
and to the other side
Hellfire

I beenslavin' workin' kickin' livin' screamin' in a hellfire
It's better to die young
I'm in a hellfire
It's better to die young
I'm in a Hellfire
It's better to die young
Yeah all alone in a hellfire
It's better to die young
