Hear one thousand screams.
Hear one thousand voices.
A solitary echo.
Feel one thousand pains,
But one is receiving a bloody invitation.

Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
Do you want taste the life?
To taste the life, to taste the life flow?
Go, Go

Feel one thousand lost,
sinking into soft skin.
Ingest rejuvenation.
One to consume,
One to renew.
Demanded invitation. 

Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
Do you want taste the life?
To taste the life, to taste the life flow?

I offer grace,
I offer blood.
I offer everything till my heart is crystal clear.
I offer grace,
I offer blood.
I offer everything till my heart is crystal clear.

Let me taste the life flow.

Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
I want to taste the life.
To taste the life, to taste the life flow.
Go, Go, Woah, Go
