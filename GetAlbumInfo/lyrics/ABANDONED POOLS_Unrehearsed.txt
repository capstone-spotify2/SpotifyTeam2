Face your fears
Bottled up somewhere
The thick skin of years
You can erase yourself if you dare
You've been running like a waterfall
Can we stop talking for a little while and maybe
Shed the weight of our former skins maybe
It's right there, somewhere

High, so high
I'm not wasted
I'm just unrehearsed
So come, baby come
I'm not asking
Now it's pouring out your mouth

It's not just luck
Not a trick of the trade
You feel like you're stuck
Getting over the choices we made
You've been running like a waterfall
Can we stop talking for a little while and maybe
Shed the weight of our former skins maybe
It's right there, somewhere

High, so high
I'm not wasted
I'm just unrehearsed
So come, baby come
I'm not asking
Now it's pouring out your mouth
