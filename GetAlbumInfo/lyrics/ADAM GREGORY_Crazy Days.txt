Baby, lets take a drive, top down
Underneath the Carolina sky
We can watch the fireflies
Try to outshine the stars

I wanna lay a blanket down
Find a way back
To where our love was found
Baby, lets go right now

Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies

First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days

Don't worry about what to wear
Those faded cut off jeans are my favorite pair
Don't go messing with your hair
Let it all blow around

Move over in the middle by me
Just like you did
When your daddy couldn't see
Why his little girl loved a boy like me

Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies

First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days

You remember cutting class
Heading to the creek
Doin' '95 down a two lane street
Staying up all night
Talkin' about forever you and me

I can see that look in your eyes
And if I know you, they don't lie
They're telling me
You're thinking about going back
About getting back

Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies

First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days
