The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love,

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth,
I felt the earth move in my hand,
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird

That was there at my command, my love,
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy it would fill the earth
And would last til the end of time, my love,
It would last til the end of time

The first time ever I saw, saw your face
Your face, your face, your face, your face
