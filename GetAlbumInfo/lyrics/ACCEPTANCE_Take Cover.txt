She's a liar
It comes to this
All we had 'til now is gone
And I'm the other
Piece to this
Every time I feel this inside
I don't wanna be the one who...

Caught you
So take cover
Never saw it comin' so you put me on again
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

She starts feeling on her own
She makes the city seem like home
All you had for me is gone
I give and I give 
But you hope in return
Never thought I'd be the one to burn

Every time I feel this inside
I don't wanna be the one to
I don't wanna be the one who...

Caught you
So take cover
Never saw it comin' so you put me on again
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

Caught you
So take cover
Never saw it comin' so you put me on again
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

Caught you
So take cover
Never saw it comin' so you put me on again
(Take cover)
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

Caught you
So take cover
Never saw it comin' so you put me on again
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old
The game, the lie is getting old
Is getting old
