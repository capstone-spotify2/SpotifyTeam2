Break out all the mechanical
Step right up to the freaky and tangible
Hands uncuffed, take the leash on this animal
If itâs getting hyphy hit me with a night stick
Slip right into your stripper shoes
Roll the dice, I got snake eyes and dÃ©jÃ  vu
Poppin off, fire melted with bally-hoo?
Tune in (tune in)
Turn on (turn on)
Drop out

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
Even hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Quick slow high or low
Youâre never gonna know for sure
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole

Catnip and honey, teatime and all over town
(all over town, all over town)
houses of candy, build âem up and then burn them down
(burn em down, just burn em down)
it melts in your face and not in your arm?
It starts in the bass and it ends in the crystal ball

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
Even hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Disco rodeo
My kaleidoscope
Cleopatra knows
What's down the rabbit hole

Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
Even hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me

Quick slow high or low
Youâre never gonna know for sure
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole
