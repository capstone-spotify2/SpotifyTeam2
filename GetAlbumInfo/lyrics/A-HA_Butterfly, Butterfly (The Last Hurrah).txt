Butterfly, butterfly
Flying into the wind
You can be sure of it
That's no place to begin

Over thinking every little thing
Acknowledge the bell you can't unring

Tomorrow
You don't have to say what you're thinking
You don't have to mean what you say

Butterfly, butterfly
Flutter into the skies
Butterfly, butterfly
Their molecular cries

Chrysalis dreams waiting on the fifth in-star
These stained glass wings could only take you so far

You don't have to say that it matters
You don't have to turn something in
Stay with it through thick and thin
Butterfly, begin

Butterfly
Butterfly

Tomorrow
You don't have to mean what you say
Left without a reason to stay
Comes the last hurrah
Here's our last hurrah

Butterfly
Butterfly
Butterfly
You can be sure of it
Butterfly
