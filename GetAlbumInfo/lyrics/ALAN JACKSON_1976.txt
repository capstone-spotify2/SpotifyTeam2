Rockie burned up the movie screen and I was turnin seventeen
Tie-dyed shirts and Levis jean, lookin cool at the Dairy Queen
Tryin to impress a young woman in her Sunday dress

And that was 1976, didnt know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976

My high school days I packed away, set my sights on a bigger stage
Jimmy Carter moved to DC, a Georgia boy just like me, life seemed easy
Nothin much that we needed

That was 1976, didnt know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

Eight track tapes were still in style and Elvis was still alive
Wonder Woman sure looked fine, Bionic Man was still Prime Time
And that girl I liked, we kept on tryin till we got it right

And that was 1976, didnt know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976

Yeah, that was 1976, didnt know who we were yet
Built a fire that just wont quit and that was 1976

We built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976
