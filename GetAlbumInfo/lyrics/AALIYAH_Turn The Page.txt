Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah

A special smile, a certain touch
I never had a love that I loved so much
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there

My very best friend, my summer day
My only someone to depend on
When I've lost my way
You came and answered my every prayer
Turn the page, you were there

What would I do if some strange morning
I opened up my eyes to find you gone
I can't imagine how I would survive it
I finally got the reason to go on

My one sure thing, my solid ground
All I ever wanted was the love that we found
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, ooh
