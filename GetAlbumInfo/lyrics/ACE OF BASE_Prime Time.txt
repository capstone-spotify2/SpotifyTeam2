Cuban cigars and the lass lass in the bars
I see the rise and a hope for this down downtown Miami
Where the people are moving and grooving from dusk till dawn
My progress is you and I want it

Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Drop dead melodies
Do it at the feast
Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Land of future, land of dreams
The rhythm is so divine

Unique I am like a unicorn tonight
So good to be at a place
That tomorrow is the answer
To the problems today
We should all go down to the light
They're so right, we're so wrong, we like it

Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Drop dead melodies
Do it at the feast
Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Land of future, land of dreams
The rhythm is so divine

Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Drop dead melodies
Do it at the feast
Prime Time, party time
Always here in the Caribbean sun
Land of future, land of dreams
The rhythm is so divine
