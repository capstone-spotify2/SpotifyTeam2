I heard you got a filthy heart,
Heartbreaking is the perfect art,
I though she was my sun,

Wish I knew what I said wasn't getting through,
Wish I knew it was dead when I looked at you,

Little did I know what was coming
Little did I know I was free

You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart.

You like to love me through hatred,
Make me feel like shit,
I always wanted to say it,
You're such a bitch,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart, heart.

Just another one that fell so hard,
Just another one that's come and gone,
I though she was the one,

Wish I knew what I said wasn't getting through,
Wish I knew it was dead when I looked at you,

Little did I know what was coming
Little did I know I was free

You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart,
You like to love me through hatred,
Make me feel like shit,
I always wanted to say it,
You're such a bitch,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart, heart,

Take your pretty reckless life,
Take these words and come back right,
I see through you,
You got a filthy heart,

You got a filthy heart,
You like to love me through hatred,
Make me feel like shit,
I always wanted to say it,
You're such a bitch,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart,
You got a filthy heart, heart.
