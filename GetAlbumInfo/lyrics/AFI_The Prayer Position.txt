Now! Peel the skin back from the flesh. Steal the flesh back from the starving static minds.
From nature we must stray, to clarity we'll climb.
Deadly impulse seems so natural, just look beyond it and we'll find a brand new evolution.
Here begins a brand new line. And in the distance there's a gathering, that no longer seems so far away.
Pushed to our knees so let us pray, and all together we'll bring the real rain.
Watch all that's wasted wash away, so let it come. Our will be done.
Stature retrieved, regain our form. Break free from instinct that's left us all confined.
From nature we must stray to clarity we'll climb. Tradition ingrained, now impermissible.
Now comes a call for all to find a brand new evolution. Here begins a brand new line.
I can't help but fear, look to my species and tremble, to think that God is just...
And in the distance there's a gathering that no longer seems so far away.
