Cursed, by the mind of evil
Fleeing from a torrent undreamed of
Horror worse than your blackest nightmare
Hiding from the antithesis of love

Sirens, tearing up the darkness
Blockbusters .....from the skies they pour
Hot winds, blowing through the burning streets
Firebombs giving way to crimes of war

One thousand dragons in the sky
Breathing flames from above

Hellfire ....... burns across the land
Hellfire .......

One giant column of flames, leaps from the furnace
No one has a prayer
Strafing runs and napalm bombs
Blacken the air

Black, is the color of vengeance
The innocent die as the flames get higher and higher
Buildings fall as the madness lingers
Feeding fuel on a giant funeral pyre

One thousand bombers in the sky -
The inferno from above

Hellfire ...... burns across the land
Hellfire .......

One giant column of flames, leaps from the furnace
No one has a prayer
Strafing runs and napalm bombs
Blacken the air

<i>[Solo]</i>

By the light of day, we see the ashes,
The beauty that once was
And in the end, there is no future less we learn
From the past and the evil that men cause

Hellfire ...... burns across the land
Hellfire ...... spawned by the hands of man
Hellfire ...... burning across the land
Hellfire .......spawned by the hands of man
