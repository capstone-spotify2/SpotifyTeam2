My mama told me I'm too young to love 
But I know what I know and I can't get enough 
I'm thinking about you and me holding hands 
Pushing you on a swing 
We can do anything 
Cause when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
I often wonder the meaning of love 
Is it something meant just for grown-ups? 
Nick always told me just to follow my dreams 
But with love on my mind it is so hard to see 
And still when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
It's true if I'm wrong 
Then tell me girl what should I do 
Or would you even care 
If I told you love could be so simple 
Between me and you 
Oh, baby 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart.
