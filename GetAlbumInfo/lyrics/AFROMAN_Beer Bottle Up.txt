Yeah,
Comeon Homeboy, Turn it up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh Buch-ach <i>[x2]</i>

Afroman, Double H, Double C
Double OG, Checking in the double tree

Colt 45, No Bubbley
Cops give me trouble, but they still don't trouble me
Hit the lights, read my rights
Fly somewhere, anywhere, anywhere, I really don't care
Run up in the club, grab me a woman (Oh)
Waitress keep them drinks 'a coming (burp)
Hah, easy come easy go, fuck what you talking bout?
I don't know, Shutup bitch, I'm in my own zone
Turn the music up, and leave me alone
Put your hands up if you're with me (ooh)
Tell the bartender, 'a hit me (Buch-ach!)

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

The hungry hustler, Afroman, That fool Raule
Fatso and Matt Payne, Drinking brew
Drinking brew, taking blunts to the brain
Palms in the air, cause it's a Palmdale thang
Everybody in the crowd, put your beer in the air (uh)
If you're real short, stand up in a chair (uh)
If you ain't quite, fucked up yet, smoke you a newport cigarette
Keep a beer, in your hand, take a swig every chance you can
If you feel the urge, go ahead and burp, chill for a minute
Then take a slurp, Drink slow homie, don't want the bottle
To get all foamy, moving, grooving, jumping around
Bottle in the air, chugging it down.

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Throw it in the trash, drop it on the ground
Stagger to the bar, get another round
If you got alot of money, than share
I'm sure another alcoholic will care
Smoke a sweet, to the beat, if it's good
Put it on the beat, gotta have alot fun before you get too old
Lock the door, to your room, drown everybody out with the boom
Stereo blasting loud as hell, cellphone calls go to your voicemail
Take a little time out for yourself
Cause Afroman is good for your health

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
