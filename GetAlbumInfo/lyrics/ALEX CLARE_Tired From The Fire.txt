I know you'll burn all, not given up awful lies
Tired from the fire, tired from the fire
I know you'll burn all, not given up awful lies
Tired from the fire, tired from the fire
Yes, it burns
Slow and low,
Consuming all,
Consuming all
Yes, it burns
Slow and low,
Consuming all,
Consuming all

She got me burning, smoldering like a <i>[?]</i> next to the fire
Next to a fire
She got me burning, smoldering, blazing all night
She got burning, smoldering like a <i>[?]</i> next to the fire
Next to a fire

I know you'll burn all, not given up awful lies
Tired from the fire, tired from the fire
I know you'll burn all, not given up awful lies
Tired from the fire, tired from the fire
Yes, it burns
Slow and low,
Consuming all,
Consuming all
Yes, it burns
Slow and low,
Consuming all,
Consuming all
