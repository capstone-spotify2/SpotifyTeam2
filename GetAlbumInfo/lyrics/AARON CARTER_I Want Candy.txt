I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
She's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy

Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
You're my girl, what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water

I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time

I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy

Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!

Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!
