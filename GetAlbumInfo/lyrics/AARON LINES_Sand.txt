Thereâs no place Iâd rather be
Than on this blanket here with you
Watching that big red sunset
Into a Caribbean blue
Weâre sure itâs hot down here
Or maybe itâs just you

Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong
Letâs let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
Thereâs no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong

Well Iâm glad we stole that bottle
From a hotel tiki bar
And Iâm glad the moon ainât out tonight
So we can hide out in the dark
Letâs show off our tan lines
To that endless sea of stars

Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong
Letâs let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
Thereâs no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong

Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong
By tomorrow morning
Baby weâll be boarding
That plane and flyinâ home
Thereâs no one around
God youâre turning me on and on and on
Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong
Baby letâs get sand
In places sand just donât belong
