We'd walk up and down the Concho River
We'd find a soft place to watch the sun go down
So was it me or was it what I could not give you
She left me shattered, my life scattered all around

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
She said time would heal my broken heart
and I'd find a true companion for my soul
You know she was right, we were wrong 
Nothing more than a pretty song
About a boy who loved a girl
In San Angelo

<i>[Repeat Intro]</i>

When I'd close my eyes, I could hear her singing
In the chapel where she said we'd wed someday
It rattled me so to hear them old church bells ringing
Knowing well enough we'd never love that way

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>

Looking back it was a blessing she broke my heart in two
But if I had never lost her, baby I'd have never found you

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
