I'm sorry, made you feel sorry

Last night, I came home too late
And you were there waiting
I know, it's easy to call
I guess I wasn't thinking of you
It's not that I don't care
You should know me better by now

I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am

I know (I know) I often forget
To say that I love you (that I love you)
And yes (and yes) I truly regret
The times that I might have hurt you that way
It's not that I don't care
You should know me better by now

I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am

True, I may defend the things I do
Though I know deep down I've done wrong
But when the heat comes down it's you
(It's you) that keeps me going on

For all that I am
I'm sorry, made you feel sorry
Trying to say that I'm not always that way
Love me for all 
I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am
(For all that I am) That I am
(For all that I am)
