Bobby had everything he thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car and a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, with no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says 'Change a kid's life with just a couple hours a week'
Normally he'd keep clicking, just surfing around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na

Well, Sara does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left, its hard to find the strength
She wipes a tear from her eye as she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, there's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight
No money, no romance, no end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says 'I love you Mom'
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na

Well, I know we've got problems
We've got to figure out, baby
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking or touching much lately
But I know this love's
Got a lot of life left in it
Oh, so let me hold you close, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, let me know, we won't wait another minute

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na

It can change the world, it can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name, it can change your heart
It can change your tune, it can change your life
