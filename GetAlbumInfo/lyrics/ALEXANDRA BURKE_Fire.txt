I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
I need you now
Cause every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter
I want you now

Sweat dripping from my brow
Hearts pumping hight speed
Chugging this water down but I'm still thirsty
Only getting worse the closer you stand next to me
Are you warm?
I feel my clothes sticking to my body
Should I take them off?
If I keep staring in your eyes
I might get a little lost
I'm walking over now it seems the whole room starts to close
I'm caught in your storm

Oh
Nothing can cool me down
Not how I feel right now
You've got my attention
Call 999
It's a problem

I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
I need you now
Cause' every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter
I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
5 and I'm Fire

Engines ring in my ear
The heats gonna start to burn
Come and whisper to me
Give me chills
With your dirty words
I can't keep myself away
The separation only hurts
How do you feel?

Oh
Nothing can cool me down
Not how I feel right now
You've got my attention
Call 999
It's a problem

I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
I need you now
Cause' every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter
I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
5 and I'm Fire

Oh
Nothing can cool me down
Not how I feel right now
You've got my attention
Call 999
It's a problem

I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
I need you now
Cause' every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter
I want you now
Like we're burning in the fervor of fire
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
3, 4, 5 and I'm
5 and I'm Fire
