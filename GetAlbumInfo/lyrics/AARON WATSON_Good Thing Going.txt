For the life of me will her memory keep on keepin' me awake?
This empty pillow by my head is proof you sleep in the bed that you make
Just like a fool I did nothin', nothin' short of helpin' her pack
Wish I could find a way, find the words to say
To bring my baby back

I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone

Thought she'd at least call to say that she was ok
While she left me walkin' the floor
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
She didn't scream or shout, she had it all mapped out, and she never even tapped the brakes

I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone

There goes my life down that highway
All of my dreams slippin' further away from this broken home
I've gotta put the pieces all back together

I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no signs of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone

I've got a good thing goin'
