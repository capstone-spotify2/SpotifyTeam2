Ay vamos
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

They can feel it when we walk in, walk in
Got no better place down
We're the summer sun they wanting, wanting
Give it to them right now

All my single ladies out there
Let me hear you say "Hell yeah"
Run the world, yeah, everywhere
Show 'em what you got, what you got

You know what they want
You the one they want
Give them what they want
You the one they want
You know what they want
You the one they want
Give them what they want
You the one they want
La fuega

La fuega, la fuega
La fuega, la fuega
La fuega, la fuega
La fuega

Everyday, we got 'em sweating, sweating
But we know they want more
Love the way we got 'em begging, begging
Waiting on the dance floor

You know what they want
You the one they want
Give them what they want
You the one they want
La fuega

La fuega, la fuega
La fuega, la fuega

(All my single ladies) La fuega
(Let me hear you say) La fuega
(Run the world, yeah) La fuega
Show 'em what you got, show 'em what you got
(All my single ladies) La fuega
(Let me hear you say) La fuega
(Run the world, yeah) La fuega
Show 'em what you got, show 'em what you got

You know what they want
You the one they want
Give them what they want
You the one they want
You know what they want
You the one they want
Give them what they want
You the one they want
(Run the world, yeah) La fuega

La fuega, la fuega
La fuega, la fuega
La fuega, la fuega
La fuega
