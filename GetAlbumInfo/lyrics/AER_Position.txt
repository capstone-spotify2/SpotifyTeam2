Whatever you thought it was it ainât
This the first time is hasnât gone your way?
I got a long list of hearts to break
Gone all the time Iâm too hard to date!
What? You gone call a lawyer?
Cuz I no longer adore Ya
Iâm a heart thief go turn a new leaf movin on is important
Cut the cord in the courtyard, Iâll give Ya more than 4 stars
But I ainât playing for keeps no you canât keep me for ya
I wish you could understand, but my signs are hieroglyphic to Ya
You want to hold my hand, but youâre always just missing arenât ya?

Iâm rollinâ
Iâm drivinâ, Iâm focused
Iâm straight gunninâ
Fast lane to the summit
You put me in this position <i>[x4]</i>

Whatever I thought it was it ainât
You put a little too much on my plate
Tried to lock me down and that I hate
Sins can be committed by a saint, what?
You hate surprises? Couldnât you see this for miles?
I might be a little bit bias, itâs not rocket science
Had a good time not lying, couldnât be more clear Iâm trying
To let you know that what youâre selling girl I ainât buying
I wish you could a comprehend but what you want just isnât comin to ya
And now for me Iâm just onto the next Iâm just lookin for someone cooler

Iâm rollinâ
Iâm drivinâ, Iâm focused
Iâm straight gunninâ
Fast lane to the summit
You put me in this position <i>[x4]</i>
