Once burned, twice shy
I've learned, I've cried
And I'm never gonna hurt that way again.
Once burned, twice shy
My heart, I'll hide
If it's ever gonna have a chance to mend.

Here he comes again, he wants to talk to me
And as he walks to me, I feel so empty inside.
Oh what can I say to him?
He's the one who hurts me so
Tell him that he'll have to go
I've got no more tears to cry.

Once burned, twice shy
I've learned, I've cried
And I'm never gonna hurt that way again.
Once burned, twice shy
My heart, I'll hide
If it's ever gonna have a chance to mend.

Someday he'll learn,
Someday he'll get burned,
And he'll say:

Once burned, twice shy
I've learned, I've cried
And I'm never gonna hurt that way again.
Once burned, twice shy
My heart, I'll hide
If it's ever gonna have a chance to mend.

Once burned, twice shy
I've learned, I've cried
And I'm never gonna hurt that way again.
Once burned, twice shy
My heart, I'll hide
If it's ever gonna have a chance to mend.
