I go walkin' 
Down a long road tonight
I go walkin'
Not a single soul in sight 
The night air is so cool 
The moon shines so bright 
It's lonely out here 
But I'm feelin' alright
I keep walkin' 
I keep walkin'
I'll be sendin' up a prayer 
I'll be climbin' heaven's stairs
I'll be lookin' out for fun
Like a son of a gun
Headed down a country road
I'll be carrying the load
I'll be lookin' for the light
'Till I get it right
I keep walkin' 
I keep walkin' I keep searchin'
For the love I haven't found
And I'm hopin' 
That the chance will come around
My days seem so empty 
My hearts come undone I'll keep on searchin' 
Until I find the one
I'll be sendin' up a prayer 
I'll be climbin' heaven's stairs 
I'll be lookin' out for fun
Like a son of a gun 
Headed down a country road 
I'll be carrying the load
I'll be lookin' for the light 
'Till I get it right
I keep walkin' I keep walkin'
'Till the tracks lead to the end of the line
We're all here for a reason 
And that reason I'm gonna find I go walkin'
Down a long road tonight 
I go walkin' 
Not a single soul in sight
I'll be sendin' up a prayer 
I'll be climbin' heaven's stairs
I'll be lookin' out for fun 
Like a son of a gun 
Headed down a country road 
I'll be carrying the load
I'll be lookin' for the light
'Till I get it right 
I keep walkin' 
I keep walkin' 
I keep walkin' 
I keep walkin'
