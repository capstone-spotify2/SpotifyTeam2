A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...

I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
Saying I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, or do you not think so far
I need someone different
You know it, or do you not think so far

No, I don't like you
I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Cause we live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together

Yes of course I remember
How could I forget how you feel?
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

But I need someone different
You know it, or do you not think so far
I need someone different
You know it, or do you not think so far

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cry if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
Saying I love you, too

Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I've been thinking about forever
