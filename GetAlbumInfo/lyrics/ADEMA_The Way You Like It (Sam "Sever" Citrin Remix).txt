I'll get inside you

Don't live with shame
'Cause feelings change
And fame remains
The reason why
You're gonna wanna take me home tonight
It's all the same
Up in this game
The people change
And money claims
Everyone from everything
I can't believe
That you would think that shit of me
I was amazed at the torment that you put me through
If you could see right through the greed
And all your needs
You'd realize that you're just about as bad as me

Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid
The way you like it
Come on baby help me
Someone to confide in
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay

My life has changed 
But fuck the fame
I'll stay the same
You can't complain when you can pay the bills and do your thing
Appreciate
Don't playa hate
Congratulate
I miss the pain and the torment that you put me through
So what's to fear
When everything is crystal clear
You realize you that should do the things you wanna do 
Don't give into
What people say
Don't be ashamed
To separate the feelings on your mind you can't sedate

Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid
The way you like it
Come on baby help me
Someone to confide in
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay
