Hey, here I am, I'm feelin' good
Takin' a ride on a hot summer night
'cause on a long, hot, hot summer night
Just don't know why I know what I am

So let'em keep on runnin'
So let'em keep on chasin' me

Yes, here I am, all heavy legged
Been dancin' on, on a hot summer night
Call me a scrounger, a degenerate bum
Every day hear it over again

So let'em keep on runnin'
But let'em keep on chasin' me

You are down and out
When you're just being your self
We ain't down and out
Man take a look at yourself

See a summernight sky,
I feel like runnin'
I feel like livin' the way I do
That's who I am,
what I'm doin's right, it ain't wrong
I'm livin' this way, if livin' is true

So let'em keep on runnin'
But let'em keep on chasin' me

You are down and out
When you're just being your self
We ain't down and out
Man take a look at yourself

You're always sayin',
I'm sleepin' all day
A day's too long to sleep it away
You gotta think it over, over again
My eyes may be closed
but I'm livin' within

Let'em keep on runnin'
For let'em keep on chasin' me

You are down and out
When you're just being your self
We ain't down and out
Man take a look at yourself

You are down and out
When you're just being your self
We ain't down and out
Man take a look at yourself
