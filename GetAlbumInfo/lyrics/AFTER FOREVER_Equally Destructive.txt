Ground is shaking
Waves are breaking
The wind has lost control
The air is shifting
While its lifting force fools gravity
A huge eruption
Vast explosions
As it bursts the earth water's pounding
Waves are sounding deadly and extreme

But we are equally destructive

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine and its endless stream

Alarming silence
Predicts the violence that is yet to come
We are senseless
Proud while blindness is catching up with us
We must measure
While the pressure of nature's force expands
We feel minor
Punished and meager
Betrayed by all our gods

We are a part of it
We are equally destructive

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine and its endless stream
