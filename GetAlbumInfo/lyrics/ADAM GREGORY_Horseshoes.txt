Sittin' on the front porch 
Rockin' on the porch swing
Wayon on the radio 
Listen to the crickets sing
Hi yi yippi yi
Yippi yi yeah

While the suns shines 
better make hay yeah
I'm feelin' lucky tonight, yeah
and everything's gonna be alright

Ringing those horseshoes
Ringing those horseshoes 

Kickin' back, kickin' butt 
knockin' on wood
There ought to be a law against 
feelin' this good
Life is a rodeo 
a one horse town
Get back up 
when it kicks you down

I'm feelin' lucky tonight, yeah
and everything's gonna be alright

I got it good I got it made in the shade
I feel like Gretzky on a breakaway
For no good reason things are goin' my way
I got to tell you
Life I love it, love it
love it yeah!

I'm feelin' lucky tonight, yeah
and everything's gonna be alright
