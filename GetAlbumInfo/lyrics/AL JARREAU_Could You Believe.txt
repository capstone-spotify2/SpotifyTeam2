Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
Could you believe precious friend of mine?
And would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
Give you courage to carry, give you courage to carry
Courage to carry your spirit up on high
Just to carry your spirit up on high

I saw people in trouble, yes heard the angels cry
Now don't tamper with my children, no, no, made the devil fly
Spent the night with David, he taught me what to say
I was looking for a smooth stone when I heard him pray

Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
And could you believe precious friend of mine?
And would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
It'll give you the courage to carry, the courage to carry
Courage to carry your freedom up on high
Go 'head and carry your spirit up on high

Oh, I could sing at times and reasons
Reason to lay your burden softly down
Kings and Prophets did for freedom
Precious dreams imprisoned underground
Well, I've got this song that I'll sing
And I'll make the mountains ring
Tell my mama that I am homeward bound

Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
And could you believe precious, precious friend of mine?
Would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
It will give you courage to carry, give you courage to carry up
Just to carry your spirit up on high, Lord
Just to carry your spirit up on high, up on high

Oh yeah, can carry up on, carry
Oh I make this promise, my Lord, I'm gonna carry
Ooh, and I promise to look for that little light
Little bit of light, gonna look for that light
Gonna look for that light bit of light when my heart is in trouble

Oh and I make this promise to look for that light
Little bit of light when my man is worried
You see the same night that brought the children through, yes it is
And it's the same night that brings the spirit through

He'll believe, gonna believe, I'm gonna believe
Don't you believe, I'm gonna believe, I'm gonna believe
Yes, I do believe, oh yes, I do believe
I'm going to believe, I'm gonna believe y'all
And I gotta believe, I gotta believe, I gotta believe

My better taught me to believe
My mama taught me to believe
And I believe, and I believe, I believe, I believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, oh my friend

Try it out one more time, try it out my son
And you'll learn how to believe
