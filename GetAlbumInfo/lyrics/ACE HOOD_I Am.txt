I sit back with this pack and this mac on my lap
And this weed that I breathe that give me the shit needed to be
One of the meanest Mc's on this earth
I'm a beast, I'm a jerk
I'm a lion, I lurk
And I rose from the dirt, I was raised in the church
Sunny days, they would fade daddy gone, mama work
Many nights of me crying know the times will get worse
Plus them bills on the first, not a dime in the purse
Tears falling know it hurts, you can feel it in this verse
Me and Four was in the murk, now he laying and in a hearse
I can't believe it, Lord Jesus reason why I'm so berserk
Its payback and I ain't sparin neither one of you, word
I'm such a maniac bring it back on this beat I just can't relax
I'm hottest not being modest you doubt it come see about it
It's fuck 'em I mean it go play roulette with the demons
Will not regret what I'm speaking so say hello to the deacon
I'm a 2Pac in its season, a living Legend in flesh
And all the bad you think of me you gon' fucking regret
I am the struggle, I am the hustle, I do rep the ghetto
Fuck the Grammy's I miss my granny in heaven she settle
I don't need no fucking medal or the hype of you niggas
I'm a killa, I squeeze the feelin and life out you niggas
Bars after bars, on some penitentiary sentence
I'm the one you should worry 'bout, but pay no attention
Till I show with them choppers risen the lord amunition
All the time that they doubted me I am through with reminiscing
Gotta get it by any means, it's my hustlers ambition
Put the bomb in yo mama car, when she crank the ignition
(Bomb exploding)

And I am, whatever you say I am
And if I wasn't, then why would I say I am
K-I-N-G, The king I am
Yeah, it's just the way it is
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
K-I-N-G I am
King of the South I am
Hood nation
We the motherfuckin best huh
Motherfuckin right I am
