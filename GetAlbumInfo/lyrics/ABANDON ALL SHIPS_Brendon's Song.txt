Help me, I canât get out,
I live my life not knowing what itâs about,
Just stains of guilt on my mind;
Heavenâs what I want to find.
This is now, that was then:
I want to be born again.

(Oh!)

The darkness came, 
The light fought through, 
Mercy is all
I ask of you. <i>[x2]</i>
Father, Father, please set me free,
From my misery. <i>[x2]</i>

I will be with youâ¦

In the beginning, I used to believe
That you were no saviour, but I was naÃ¯ve.
You were a stranger that I couldnât see.
Now Iâm in danger; please set me free.

Even softâ¦

Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
Pray for us, sinners now,
And at the hour of our death,
Save us.

Where would I be, 
Without you standing next to me?
I am the lock and you are the key
Release me from my,
Release me from my
Insanity.
