It was a pretty good performance
Yesterday out on the street
Maybe they should give me an Emmy or an Oscar
Cause you didn't suspect a thing
We made small talk on the sidewalk
I even laughed out loud
And I didn't blink an eye when I told you that I'm happy now
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar

Truth is I've had a lot of practice
I've put on this show before
Just like the day you told me we were history
I was brilliant standing right outside your door
I convinced you and me too
It was gonna be all right
That we'd both be better off that I would get on with my life

I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar

It's time I came clean
It's time I told the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
Baby I'm still in love with you

Yeah

I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Baby my heart's on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
Yeah I'm a good liar
