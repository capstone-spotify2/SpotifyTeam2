Well I see you staring from the front row, girl
With a challenge in your eye
Darin' me to knock you out of your seat
And you can't believe that a guy like me
Can rock you till your paralyzed
And leave you beggin' for more like a dog in heat

Now if its rock and roll you came for
It's rock and roll you're gonna get, ya!, ya!...

We got your rock, right here
We got your rock, right here
if you still don't understand,
I'll shout it out loud and clear
We got your rock, right here

You got a backstage pass and a nice little ass
And you say you wanna take me home
And it's nice to know that I've won you're heart
'Cause that's why I'm here, you see
But you won't get me as easy I'll get you

Now if its rock and roll you came for
It's rock and roll you're gonna get, ya!, ya!...

We got your rock, right here
We got your rock, right here
if you still don't understand,
I'll shout it out loud and clear
We got your rock, right here
