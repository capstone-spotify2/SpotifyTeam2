You've got a bad reputation
All over the street
There's some indication
You've been indiscreet

Oh I know you can turn on the charm
When you feel so inclined
Whatever I do
I can't get you out of my mind

It's a sad situation
I'm coming apart
A clear invitation
For trouble to start

If I knew what it was that you did
It's so hard to define
But whatever it is
I can't get you out of my mind

Maybe I'm seeing
What I want to see
Trying to make you
What you'll never be

Perhaps it's just the simple fact
You only want the things that you can't have
Well I suppose somebody broke your trust
Now I see you kicking up the dust

I wouldn't be at all surprised
If some of it got in my eyes
You've got a bad reputation
They're telling me so

I've got a strong motivation
To get up and go
If I knew what it was that you did
I'd just leave you behind

But whatever it is
I can't get you out of my mind
I suppose this will come to a close
It's just a matter of time

But whatever I do,
I can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
Oh no, whatever I do, I can't get you out of my mind
