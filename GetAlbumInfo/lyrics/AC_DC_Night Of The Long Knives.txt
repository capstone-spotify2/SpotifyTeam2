Who your leader who your man
Who will help you fill your hand
Who's your friend and who's your foe
Who's your Judas you don't know
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long long knife

Where's that saviour
Where's that light
When your prayin' for your life
Who's that fightin' back to back
Who's defending who's attack
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long
Long knife

Stab him in the back

It's the night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
It's the night of the long long knife

It's the night of the
Night of the
Night of the long long knife
