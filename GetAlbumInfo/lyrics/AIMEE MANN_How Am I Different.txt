I can't do it, I can't conceive
You're everything you're trying to make me believe

'Cause this show is too well designed
Too well to be held with only me in mind

And how, how am I different?
How, how am I different?
How, how am I different?

I can't do it, so move along 
Do you really want to wait until I prove you wrong?

And don't tell me, let me guess 
I could change it all around if I would just say yes

But how, how am I different? 
How, how am I different?
How, how am I different?  

And just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later, do I get my money back?

I can't do it, and as for you
Can you in good conscience even ask me to?

'Cause what do you care about the great divide 
As long as you come down on the winner's side?

And how, how am I different?
How, how am I different?
How, how am I different?

(Different) Different
(Different) Different  
(Different)

And just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later, do I get my money back? (Do I get my money back?)
Just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later, do I get my money back? (Do I get my money back?)
Just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later, do I get my money back? (Do I get my money back?)
