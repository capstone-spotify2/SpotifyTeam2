I am on your side
You light me up inside
You fill my eyes with stars
It doesn't get me very far

Just look around
You don't need no fairy tale
To get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up

But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in 
to space
