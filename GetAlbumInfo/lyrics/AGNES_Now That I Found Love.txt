Don't walk, don't talk with a stranger - mama used to say 
But I've been dying to meet you since I saw you the other day 
At the cofee house - you were walking out, and I was walking in 
I looked at you, you looked at me - and my head began to spin 

Is it you?
Could it be?
Questions run from A to Z 
Are you my once in a lifetime, baby? 
Is it now?
Whas it then?
Will I ever see you again?

Now that I found love
I just wanna find you
Remind you, baby 
Now that I found love
Baby, I'm dying to
Put my arms around you

Now I see what they mean by the saying
Love can make you blind 
Cause shoulda, woulda, coulda are the words that come to mind 
At the cofee house
Should've talked it out, but I let it go undone 
Will destiny get the best fo me
Or bring us back as one?

Remind you baby 
Now that I foudn love
Baby, I'm dying to

Can't even tell what I'm going trough or 
Why I feel like I've been knowing you for 
Ages and ages and ages and more 
It's a fever that needs a cure 
Is it you?
Could it be? 
Is t true what I feel? 
Am I head over heels? 
Or is (it) simply my mind playing tricks on me? 

Now that I found love
I just wanna find you
remind you baby 
Now that I foudn love
Baby, I'm dying to
put my arms around you
