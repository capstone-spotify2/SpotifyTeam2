You know, the landlord rang my front door bell,
I let it ring for a long, long spell,
I went to the window, peaked through the bar,
Tell me what was on the old manâs mind.

Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna stay here with me.

I scream and I scream and Iâm so hard pressed
I call the woman that I love best.
I finally reached my baby by half past three
I said I like to do what you want with me.

She said
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna get along with me.

She screamed and said âwhatâs wrong with you?â
Just stay home, problem is stay trough
I said, tell me, baby, face to face,
How could another man take my place?

She said
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna get along with me.

I learned my lesson and now I knew
They saw me shining, with me blue.
When my day come and where my day go
But though I say how I love âem so.

I want the
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna stay here with me.
