What once did exist, now is meaningless
And doesn't it seem funny, how soon you did forget 
(<i>[ECHO:]</i> how soon you did forget)
All the words have now lost their weight
But I remember, I remember

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know (all that I know...)
Is isolation
Self damnation
All life that I'd own
WAS SHED AND WORTHLESS NOW!

What I knew was wrong
One who lived is gone
Guess it was just an echo
When you would sing my song
(ECHO: you would sing my song)
All the notes you'd forgotten now
You left abandoned, I remember

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know (all that I know...)
Is isolation
Self Damnation
All life that I'd own
WAS SHED AND WORTHLESS NOW!

I can
hate myself
more... 
more than anyone

WILL YOU JOIN ME!?

I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THIS 
TORTURES ME!
HAVE I CREATED THE SUFFERING!?
SHOW ME!

Or do you happily cut, further in?
to sever what's left inside, that binds me.

Now all i feel is 

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know (all that I know...)
Is isolation
Self damnation
All life that I'd own
WAS SHED AND WORTHLESS NOW!

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know (all that I know...)
Is isolation
Self damnation
All life that I'd own
WAS SHED AND WORTHLESS, WORTHLESS NOW!
