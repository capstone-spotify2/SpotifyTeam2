IÂ´m all laid up in bed with a broken heart,
While I'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar,
And we don't know how,
How we got in to this mad situation,
Only doing things out frustration,
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard,

<i>[Alex G:]</i>
I need you now but I can't seem to find a time,
I've got a new job now on the unemployment line,
And we don't know how,
How we got into this mess
is it god's test,
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best,
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

<i>[Both:]</i>
But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine,
Sit talking up all night,
Saying things we haven't for a while
A while, ya
We're smiling but we're close tears,
Even after all these years,
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
for the first time

<i>[Jess Moskaluke:]</i>
He's in line at the door
With her head held high (high)
While I just lost my job but
Didn't lose my flight
But we both know how,
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts,
When you pick yourself up,
You get kicked to the dirt,
Trying to make it work but,
Man these times are hard

<i>[Both:]</i>
But we're gonna start by,
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine,
Sit talking up all night,
Doing things we haven't for a while,
A while ya,
We're smiling but we're close to tears,
Even after all these years,
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
for the first time.

Oh these times are hard,
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
