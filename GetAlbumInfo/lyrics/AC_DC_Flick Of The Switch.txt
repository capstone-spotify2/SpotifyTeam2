Well there's a love gone down on mine
Suicidal voltage line
She send signals out of distress
She devil she evil
She's got you reelin' on a rockin' machine

With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
She'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
She can satisfy

She's gonna blow you all sky high
Flash the eye electrify
A power force you should feel
She devil she evil
She's get you screamin' on a lightnin' machine

With a flick of the switch
Flick of the switch
She'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
Flick of the switch
She can satisfy
Give you pain
Blow your brains

Flick the switch
Flick the switch
With a flick of the switch she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch she can satisfy
With a flick of the switch gonna burn you down
With a flick of the switch raise to the ground
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch she gonna give you pain
With a flick of the switch she gonna blow your brain

Blow your brain
She gonna put the light out on
You
