Sometimes we need to start again 
When this crazy life of ours is slow 
And I guess that's why fools like us rush in 
Where wise men never never go 

In time we may find out why 
These walls we build seem so high 
But I've gotta believe that we can break through 
And I gotta believe this love is good for me and you 

And all we have to do to make it last, oh yeah 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove is try a little harder, try a little harder 

You're the wildfire in my life 
Always burning out of my control 
Sometimes you cut me like a knife 
Deep into my heart 
Way down to my soul 
But somehow we survive 
And we get another chance to make it right 
But I gotta believe that we know which path to choose 
And I gotta believe that somehow we will see it through 

All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 

Each precious moment that we share 
Is locked up in my heart forever more 
I just need to know that you really care 
When you touch my hand 
Swear I'm gonna fall apart 

All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder
