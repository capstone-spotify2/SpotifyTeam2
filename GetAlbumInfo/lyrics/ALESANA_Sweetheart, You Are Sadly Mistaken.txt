Mark my words this night is far from its end
Please spare me your threats and your useless remarks
Go ahead, I dare you!
Take one step closer to this gap baby! I'll show you what I mean!
I can't let fear get the best of me right now
Keep smiling and soon you will pay!

Close your eyes and let your mind escape into a world of dreams
I won't wake you
Close your eyes and keep them shut
The next part isn't going to be a very pretty sight
Forget about tonight, tomorrow will be here so soon
And we'll be busy singing, "The wicked witch is dead!"
Once upon a time seems so like a fairy tale, I guess
For us it's true

Who's laughing now?
Blood pours from her dry mouth as she begs for mercy
Oh, how she screams!
If you think you'll win my forgiveness
Awww, sweetheart, you're sadly mistaken!
You shouldn't have brought us! You shouldn't have hurt us!
You have not one clue what you've started but trust me
You'll know when I'm finished!
(Its time, baby!)

Close your eyes and let your mind escape into a world of dreams
I won't wake you
Close your eyes and keep them shut
The next part isn't going to be a very pretty sight
Forget about tonight, tomorrow will be here so soon
And we'll be busy singing, "The wicked witch is dead!"
Once upon a time seems so like a fairy tale, I guess
For us it's true

You'd better run faster than that
I know you're feeling scared but so am I
Don't you dare turn around...Hold on as tight as you can!
I know that you're afraid but so am I
There's no time for tears...run till you can't feel your legs!

Close your eyes...
Forget about tonight, tomorrow will be here so soon
And we'll be busy singing, "The wicked witch is dead!"
Once upon a time seems so like a fairy tale, I guess
For us it's true

Look who's laughing now!
Blood pours from her dry mouth as she begs for mercy
If you think you'll win my forgiveness
Awww. sweetheart, you're sadly mistaken!
(It's time, baby!)
