You take no victims
No oneâs ever spared
And hold the hearts of everyone whoâs ever cared
Why canât you just be done with this
Youâve always been known to cause a scene
I hope he wonât let you pull him 
Or Iâll have you screaming please, mercy

I bet you can still taste me on his lips
Smell my perfume as he grabs your hips
How does it feel to be last again?
Is this what you call a win?

Nostalgiaâs hit its breaking point
I guess this time I lost the fight
Trying not to care but I just care so much
I guess it wasnât enough
Why canât you just be done with this
Youâve always been known to cause a scene
I hope he wonât let you pull him 
Or Iâll have you screaming please, mercy

I bet you can still taste me on his lips
Smell my perfume as he grabs your hips
How does it feel to be last again?
Is this what you call a win?
We try but we fall every time
Can we ever get this right?
We try but we fall every time
Can we ever get this right?

I donât know
How to make this last
Iâve surrendered all the faith that Iâve ever had
Iâm giving up
Trying to see the good in you
All that I know is, that your cold heart beats through

I bet you can still taste me on his lips
Smell my perfume as he grabs your hips
How does it feel to be last again?
Is this what you call a win?
We try but we fall every time
Can we ever get this right?
We try but we fall every time
Can we ever get this right?
