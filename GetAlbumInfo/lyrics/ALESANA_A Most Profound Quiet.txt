We should go ahead and kill her right now
But her eyes are so lovely
I can't wait! Just imagine how she will suffer!
Would someone please tell me I'm not alright
How could you fall for my charming charade?

Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me
I feel as if I am responsible
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit?
I feel as if I am responsible

Does she know before I met her I have only dreamt of so much blood?
So why is she tempting me?
Can you see the visions of pain?
How could I? Is that possible?
You must give her to me!
I'm tired of washing my hands clean of what I've done
'Tis to a murderer's den you have come

Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me
I feel as if I am responsible
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit?
I feel as if I am responsible

Something in this empty room is telling me that I should run!
Its time we throw away the mask
What have we done?
We got too attached!
We can't let her escape!
We let her escape!
This is the last time we ever have to speak again!
She is no longer yours!
We can't let her escape!
She's all mine!

Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me
I feel as if I am responsible
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit?
I feel as if I am responsible

Does she know before I met her I had only dreamt of so much blood?
So why is she tempting me?
