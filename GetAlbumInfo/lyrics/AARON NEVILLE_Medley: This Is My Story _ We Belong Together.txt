This is my story, I have no song
Just alone and broken hearted
Just because I fell in love
In love with you

I pray that you'll come back to me
Just to hear you say you love me
And we'll never, ever part
Part from you

Dooba, da do , da do, da do
Dooba, dooba, dooba,
Dooba, da do, da do, da do
Dooba, dooba, dooba
Dooba, da do, da do, da do
Dooba, dooba ,dooba do
Da do, da do, da do

You pray that I'll come back to you
Yes, darling, I love you
And we'll never, ever part
No we'll never, ever part
No we'll never , ever part
No we'll never, ever part

You're mine, and we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For etern, eternity
Eternity

You're mine, your kiss belongs to me
Yes, it belongs to only me
For etern, eternity
Etern, eternity

You're mine, my baby
May you always be
I love you so
I love you so much
Well, I'm gonna give you everything I own
And I'll always (always), always (always), love you

Whoa, I know, I know you're mine
An we belong together
Yes we belong together
For etern, eternity
