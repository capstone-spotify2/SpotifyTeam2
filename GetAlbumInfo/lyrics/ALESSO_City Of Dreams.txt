Everything seems like a city of dreams,
I never know why,
But I still miss you.

There she's standing in a field of lights,
I close my eyes,
And I still miss you.

Uohooooo Ohooooo

And I still miss you,

Uohooooo Ohooooo

And I still miss you.

Everything seems like a city of dreams,
I never know why,
But I still miss you.

There she's standing in a field of lights,
I close my eyes,
And I still miss you.

Uohooooo Ohooooo

And I still miss you,

Uohooooo Ohooooo

And I still miss you.
