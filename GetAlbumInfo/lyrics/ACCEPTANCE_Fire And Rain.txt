We came for the fire, but we stay for the rain
And we count our time while we're feeling so sane
With a cannonball head and a paperback heart
Will you see where you've been when you get to the start?

Last season of this masquerade
One decision from our lips

Will you cover your heart when you see what I've done?
Will you look in my eyes and then stare at the sun?
I see you falling asleep while I'm saving the wane
I hear you calling my name when you make a mistake

I can see your breath, I'm looking numb now
You're running my way, I can't hear a sound
With a cannonball crash and a paperback spine
If I touch your face, tell me what will I find?

Last season of this masquerade
One decision from our lips

Will you cover your heart when you see what I've done?
Will you look in my eyes and then stare at the sun?
I see you falling asleep while I'm saving the wane
I hear you calling my name when you make a mistake

Let me down by the foolish flame
And I'll take the blame
I'll take the blame

We came for the fire and drowned in the rain
We went in alone and came out the same

Will you cover your heart when you see what I've done?
Will you look in my eyes and then stare at the sun?
I see you falling asleep while I'm saving the wane
I hear you calling my name when you make a mistake
