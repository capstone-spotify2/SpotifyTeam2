Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth, yeah

It's Friday and I'm ready to sing
Pick up my girls and hit the party scene
Tonight, oh, it's alright, umm
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood 'cause you know it's alright

So Mr. DJ keep the music grooving
Keep on moving
Don't stop moving, don't stop moving
Let me see you, let me see you go

Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
See you go back and forth

Now's the time for you to make your move
To the dance floor, so throw your hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care
Ya oh, it's the L I Y A H livin' up the stage
I got jazz personality, cheap mentality, breach to Soul Train

So Mr.DJ keep the music groovin'
Keep on moving, don't stop moving
Now let me see you go back and forth
Back and forth

Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
And let me see you go

Hey, here's the formality, get upon the floor, you see
Show your personality, be who you wanna be, tell me
See, can you feel the groove moving around you?
Hey, I wanna get this party move all night

So Mr.DJ keep the music groovin'
Keep on moving
Don't stop moving, don't stop moving
Now let me see you go back and forth
Back and forth
