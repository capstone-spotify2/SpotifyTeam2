night time - all alone - nowhere to begin
it seems to me that in the past
the darkness was my friend
those times have changed, i'm now a stranger
in a violent place
i walk alone down empty streets
i turn my head, did someone call my name?

i feel allright - but i keep on hearing voices in the night

i've got a feeling something's wrong
but i can't place it
a feeling that i know is real
'cause i can taste it
someone's watching me - i feel their presence
but i can't see them
some else is right behind me
i hold my breath - i get the feeling...

i feel allright - but i keep on hearing voices in the night
