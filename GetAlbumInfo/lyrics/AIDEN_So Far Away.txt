Misery, come take me,
Into a place I can't forget.
We'll take solace in the comfort of regret.
Misery, come take me,
I said I'm ready, now where's your hat?
Oh it's a million miles away from here, take my hand.

You're so perfect, oh you're so perfectly inept.

So far, far away, are you with me?
So far, far away, are you with me?
Will the music light, will the music light the day?

Misery, I'm with thee,
In this beautiful loneliness.
And your legacy will last a lifetime, my regret.

You're so perfect, oh you're so perfectly in death.

So far, far away, are you with me?
So far, far away, are you with me?
Will the music light, will the music light the day?

You're so perfect, oh you're so perfectly in death.

So far, far away, are you with me?
So far, far away, are you with me?
So far, far away.

Will the music light, will the music light the day?
Oh will the music light, oh will the music light the day?
Will the music light the day?

You're so far away.
