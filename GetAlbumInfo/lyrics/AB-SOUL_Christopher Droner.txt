(It's all subjective shit)
Yeah, you know? It's like the calm before the storm
(Perception is everything)
Soulo the god and The Ichiban Don

Bunch of fuckin' drones
Bunch of drones, can't think for your own

Can't think for your own

Out my window all I see is Babylon, grab your gun
You ain't a knight tonight, you won't live to see the mornin' sun
Yellow tape, pistols in your face, hold on, show no weakness
Money, murder, grab your burner, cabins burnin' where it's freezing
Soulo, yeah I'm the one you heard about
Fuck's gotten into Herbert now? He's so foul it's birds around
Had it my way like it's Burger King, you don't want beef, put that burger down
Don't go against my coalition, you can kiss my colon, pow
Guess it's in my heritage, I double-cross snakes and go ape shit
Psychedelic, she left on her heels and I'm chewin' pills, I can't taste shit
My dick look like a spaceship, "Stairway to Heaven" on my playlist
On 9/11 I called 9-1-1 and the voice recording said this (Hello)

This ain't no manifesto, you niggas know me
My niggas manifest O's of the OG
High tech sippin' hi-tech like Detroit Red used to coach me
AB, see he, D-E, F the (most G)
No pen though, I just pulled this shit out the wind, bro
Ain't got shit to lose, but a win bro, it's a win, bro, this shit's simple
Gettin' dough like Papa John, your momma all on Papa John
Ain't got no chain, I ain't no slave, ain't got no watch, I ain't got the time
The SWAT team got robots and I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' mine
Literally, fuck a pair of shoes, I'm cockin' nines, dare you to shoot
Headline, Ab-Soul facin' fed time
Rewind, it wasn't 'bout that, no rat but I'm droppin' dimes
Iceberg Slim with the furnace on, I knows war, that's real talk
All my life, I knew I was ill, Rock had me on the billboard
In God I trust, I ain't no fool, no
But on the real, I just hope my credit card does too, Soul

I bought some Alexander Wang, after I heard "New Slaves"
Went and bought some Alexander Wang, after I heard "New Slaves"
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul, y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul, y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul
