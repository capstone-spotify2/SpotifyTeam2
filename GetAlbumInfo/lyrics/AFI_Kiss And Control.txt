Watch the stars,
Turn you to nothing.
Now blush and smile as they whisk you away.

Part your lips a bit more,
I'll swallow your fear.
I will show you how.
All the bite marks impress
A need to be here,
A need to see.

City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall upon debutantes

Reeling from nights that
Kiss and Control,
All of our, broken hearts.

Velvet burns,
The wrists while restraining..
You blushed and smiled,
And said you would stay.

One more time seal my breath,
I'll feed you the sky.
I will show you how.
Steal the glamour from death,
And before you die,
Oh, you should see.

City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall upon debutantes

Reeling from nights that
Kiss and Control,
All of our, broken hearts.

Hearrrrrrtssss.
Ourrrrr heartssss.

"We all want to die like movie stars" you said as you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor.
While above us glowing, exploding, our dreams burst forth in light in death.
Hold me and tell me,
"We'll burn like stars. We'll burn as we fall. Watch as the city lights DANCE FOR US!"

City lights, like rain,
Dance and explode.
Fall upon the pain of our lives,

Reeling from nights that
Kiss and Control,
Fall apart, the pain of our lives, has pain.

Dance and explode.

City lights like rain
City lights sowcress me

Kiss and Control

All of our, broken hearts.
