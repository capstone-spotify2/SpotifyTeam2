I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone
And left me lonely

I, I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me
And my loneliness left me

I use to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak
But now that I've found you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you loves beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain

And you did more
Than mend a broken heart
Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel
The same way

I never dreamed there'd be
Someone to hold me until you
Told me and now that I've found

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I never dreamed there'd be
Someone to hold me until you
Told me and now that I've found

<i>[Chorus]</i>
