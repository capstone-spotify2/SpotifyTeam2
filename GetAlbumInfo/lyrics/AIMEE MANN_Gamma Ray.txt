You build bombs, youâre familiar with explosions
the flat palms of the holiday
but thereâs slime crawling back up from the ocean
you canât keep everyone at bay

It all starts with an accident or failure
it all starts with a great big bang
and guess who's gonna have to play the jailer?
and guess whoâs gonna lead the chain gang?
Gamma Ray

and one thing leads to another and none of it's good
none of it's good,
none of it's good

Thereâs some flaw that you cannot help but foster
thereâs some weakness you canât forgive
and from that, youâve been turned into a monster
a nightmare that you force yourself to live

And one thing leads to another and none of itâs good
none of itâs good
none of itâs good
