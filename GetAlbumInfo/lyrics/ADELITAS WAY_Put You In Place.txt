I think you got a bigger problem than I'm lettin' you know,
Your causing trouble all the time 'cuz you talk to much,
Your a weak kid I can see the fear in your eyes,
You better watch motherfucker 'cuz it's me this time,

I will put you in place,
I will show you my rage,
That's inside of me,
And I can feel it in my veins,

I will put you in place,
I will show you the way,
It all comes crashing down,
You know you can't stop me now,
And you know you can't stop me now,

I bet your wishing you could take back what you said before,
And when your begging me for mercy I'ma give you some more,
This lesson's free kid, I can see the shame in your eyes,
Cuz when it's all said and done your gonna see the light,

I will put you in place,
I will show you my rage,
That's inside of me,
And I can feel it in my veins,

I will put you in place,
I will show you the way,
It all comes crashing down,
You know you can't stop me now,
And you know you can't stop me now,

I think you got a bigger problem than your livin' within,
You wanna come at me now I can show again,
I think you got a bigger problem than your livin' within,
You wanna talk a little more and I will show you again,
Show you again,

Why won't you show your face?,
I will put you in place,
I will show you my rage,

I will put you in place,
I will show you my rage,
That's inside of me,
And I can feel it in my veins,

I will put you in place,
I will show you the way,
It all comes crashing down,
You know you can't stop me now,
You know you can't stop me now,
And you know you can't stop me now.
