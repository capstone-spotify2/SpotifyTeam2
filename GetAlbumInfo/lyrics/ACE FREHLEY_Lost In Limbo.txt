The party's over in the morning light
My head is spinning, lost my appetite
Barkin' dog, much too loud 
Chuck him a bone and get me outta this town

Voices I hear I can't explain 
These neon lights they hurt my brain
Feeling no pain, my body's numb
From hell's kitchen to kingdom come

Not feeling happy, not feeling sad
Not feeling anything, good or bad
I'm not in heaven, I'm not in hell
This must be limbo, now can't you tell

Can't you tell?
C'mon
Lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
We're just lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
Baby! We're just lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
With nowhere to go

The morning after is such a bore
Can't even focus on the kitchen floor
Telephone, please don't ring
Want to forget about everything

Not feeling happy, not feeling sad
Not feeling anything, good or bad
I'm not in heaven, I'm not in hell
This must be limbo, now can't you tell

Can't you tell?

Lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
We're just lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
We're just lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
Baby! We're just lost, lost in limbo, limbo, limbo
With nowhere to go
Nothin' to see
Feelin' no pain
It must be
It must be limbo
Limbo lower now!!
