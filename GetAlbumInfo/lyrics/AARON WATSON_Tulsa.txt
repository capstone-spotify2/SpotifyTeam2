When I left Tulsa she was still an innocent lady
Lord only knows why she loved a guy like you
She called me cryin and she said she was havin your baby
You turned your back on her and broke her heart in two
I swore id get you for what you're puttin me through
And the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to says she loves you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
If the sun goes down on you
If you're still here you're goin down too
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa

Shes the only thing I've ever really cared for
No she don't deserve this kind of shame
She carries a burden around that
You know you are to blame for
And you just laughed and said
They ain't gettin your name

I swore id get you for what you're puttin me through
And the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to says she loves you

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
