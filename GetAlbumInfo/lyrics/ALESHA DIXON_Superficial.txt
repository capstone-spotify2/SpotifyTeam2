I guess what I'm trying to say is,
Every day is like a different flavour
I know it can be superficial
But in the end, there's more that I discover
I'll it break down, what I'm saying
Cause one day you're high
And then the next you're low
It's like a merry-go-round
Wherever you go, you're gotta ride it
Anything is possible, I'm feeling good
Oh it's what I do it for, it's all the music's gonna give me *

Oh it's superficial
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful
It feels like no other high
But underneath it all, it's superficial, yeah

<i>[Adlib]</i>
I don't wanna sound ungrateful
I wouldn't change it cause I love what I do
It's a love hating complication
I'm getting knocked down but I always pull through
Cause one day you're high
And then the next you're low
You gotta work it out, what living is all about
Cause anything is possible, we're feeling good
Oh we do it just for you
We're getting back what we've giving

Oh it's superficial
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful
It feels like I'm on a high
But underneath it all, it's superficial, yeah

You got me dazed and confused
But I'm loving all that I do
Otherwise I wouldn't pursue
Cause I always live by the truth
And now I need a little time to do the do
Cause I'm living by the rhythm and the blues
I'm gonna tell you about how I made it through
By being open and wise to fools
It's it's electricity, hey connected physically
A mental stimulation, ya feeling me
Once, twice, and then comes the trilogy
For better or worse, they're still selling me
How ya like the way it sounds?
The way that the beat goes down
And all I wanna do is spit pon de mic
Cause the rest is superficial
Don't beleive the hype

Oh it's superficial
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful
It feels like I'm on a high
But underneath it all, it's superficial, yeah
