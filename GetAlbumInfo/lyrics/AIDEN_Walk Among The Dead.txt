This is for the godless and vilified
This is for the faithless soul
The last of human kind
This is for gutless and terrified
The end of the human race
To conquer and divide
We laugh, oh we laugh

Among the dead / Yeah I'm not afraid to die
We walk among the dead / I just stop breathing
Among the dead / Wake up wake up alive
We walk among the dead / Unafraid to die

This is for the godless and vilified
This is for the human race
They try to exterminate we laugh
Oh we laugh

This is a call to every kid on the street in search
of food and shelter, to every gay and lesbian
who need not suffer some divine dictatorship
instruction that was given to barbaric semi illiterate
tribe in the desert two thousand fucking
years ago, this song is to stand up and say "No
more!" Faith is the enemy of reason and religion
will be the end of us ALL.

Among the dead / I'm not afraid to die
We walk among the dead / I just stop breathing
Among the dead / Wake up wake up alive
We walk among the dead / Unafraid to die
Among the dead / I'm not afraid to die
We walk among the dead / Godless and Immortal

Among the dead / Not afraid to die
We walk among the dead / Godless and Immortal
