Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Open up your heart and see
All the love inside is just for me

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Baby I will set you free
All the love inside is just for me

I feel alive now, baby somehow, you raised me up and love when I was down
Now you're mine I won't give up, you give me light I will wake up
I feel alive now, baby somehow, you raised me up and love when I was down
And I promise you my baby now, I won't let you down

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Open up your heart and see
All the love inside is just for me

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Baby I will set you free
All the love inside is just for me

I feel alive now, baby somehow, you raised me up and love when I was down
Now you're mine I won't give up, you give me light I will wake up
I feel alive now, baby somehow, you raised me up and love when I was down
And I promise you my baby now, I won't let you down

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Open up your heart and see
All the love inside is just for me

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Baby I will set you free
All the love inside is just for me

A million years if I could live
A thousand lies if I could give
I would spend it all again with you
Don't forget where you belong, only with me you are strong
Now not even the Gods above can break, baby what we have

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Open up your heart and see
All the love inside is just for me

Baby I'm your angel
Please don't be a stranger
Baby I will set you free
All the love inside is just for me
