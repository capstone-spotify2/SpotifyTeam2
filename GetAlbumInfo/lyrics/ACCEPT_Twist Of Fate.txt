Everybodyâs got a line that they walk on
Somewhere between heaven and hell
A blank slate that the world gets to write on
Pick up the chalk and get out of your shell
Now and then, you know you got to ramble
Get out, out of your comfort zone
Sometimes ......you have to take a gamble
You might do better with the devil you know

There's a man sized hole in the ocean
Just a waiting there to suck you in
So before you go raising a commotion
Think twice about where you swim

So be careful what you wish for
You might get it, and then it's too late
The future's knocking at the front door
Beware now the Twist of Fate

Too late .........make no mistake
Beware now the Twist of Fate
Too late ......... what lies in wait
Out beyond the gates.......

Sometimes you put your hand in the fire
Take a chance and you don't get burned
Other times you get tripped by a wire
They watch you dance, it's a lesson learned

So be careful what you wish for
You just might get it, and then it's too late
The future's knocking at your front door
Beware now the Twist of Fate

Too late .........make no mistake
Beware now the Twist of Fate
Too late .........what lies in wait
Could be a Twist of Fate ........

<i>[Solo]</i>

Too late .........make no mistake
Beware now the Twist of Fate
Too late .........make no mistake
Beware now the Twist of Fate
Too late ........ what lies in wait
It's a Twist of Fate ........
