(Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy)

Wait Papa, sorry but I'm a big girl
Wait Papa, (get lost, get lost)
He walked and flipped everything in my world
Wait Papa, (you get busy or get busy or get busy)

Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave him, I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I

Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama

Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

(Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy)

Don't hate Papa, he ain't like everyone thinks
Wait Papa, (get lost, get lost)
No bad boy, whenever he is with me
Wait Papa, (you get busy or get busy or get busy)

Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave him, I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I

Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama

Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame

You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame

For the rest of my life
I got to leave him, I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I
