Each day the sun
Come out to shine
Yes the stars and the moon
They just live on, just live on all the time

The wind it blows
As we listen and breathe and breathe
God's living air

You know the flowers grow, yeah
And they do not talk, Oh Lord
They do not spend
Spend or work at all

You know the birds they live
Live and, get their care
Surely there is, there is a God somewhere

Yes my heart tells me
Surely, surely, surely
There must be, must be a God somewhere
