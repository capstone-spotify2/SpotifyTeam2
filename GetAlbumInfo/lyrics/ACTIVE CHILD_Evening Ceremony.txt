Even if I wanted to love you,
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you,
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you

Hold me, hold me close,
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise Iâll take control
Even if I wanted to run with you,
Would you run with me?
Even if I wanted to hold you
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you <i>[pray for you, pray for you]</i>,
Hold me, hold me close,


In the middle of the night
I feel your presence taking control
So many reasons 
Donât try to take what you didnât wanna start
So many reasons
Donât try to take what you didnât wanna start

Hold me, hold me close,
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise Iâll take control
Even if I wanted to love you
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you,
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you,
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you
