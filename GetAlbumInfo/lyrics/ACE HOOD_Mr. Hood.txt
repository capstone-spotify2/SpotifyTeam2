Now I dun been so talked about and laughed at,
Doubted by my family,
Reachin for them favors but nobody giving hand backs,
Came back, anthrax, spitting like a automacâ
This is where it started at, way before that We The Best,
I was back in Deerfield, giving momma heart attacks,
Calling but no answer she just wonder where her son was at,
I was in the studio, you was moving work and blow,
I was thinkinâ bigger shit, they just want some 24â²s,
Me Iâm dreaming millionaire, I don't think they hear me though,
Slidinâ with my brother them, what you think that rental foâ
Livin at my momma house, tellin me to watch my mouth,
Workin with that 9 to 5, hated it without a doubt,
Fuck that job and left it there, met with DJ Khaled them
Couple months Iâm outta here broward county pioneer,
Walking with no kinda feel, passed up on them scholarships,
Mr. Broward county in the flesh remember I am him,
And I play the game how Iâm âposed to got my name all on
Them posters I ain't boastin Iâm jusâ stating facts,
And Iâm taking over fuck you loners,
Tell yo owner I pulled over like my Rover may have caught a flat
I am fucking back, like yo spinal cord,
All you lames extinct, to many dinosaurs,
Flow is super sick, Iâm talkin herpey sores
Biggest shit in years, Iâm talkin jersey shores,
ya, and like a cheeto I remain the same,
Gotta let the world know wat my fuckin name,
That's why I hustle like Iâm ten of yall,
And they don't believe me check my protocal
Iâm mista, keep a bad bitch, Louis V frames
I jusâ hope you get the picture
Man a nigga starvin marvin and no time to bargain,
None you niggas pose a threat, yâall ain't in my target,
Swingin to the top spot you can call me Tarzan,
Walking over lames, they can clearly play the carpet,
Hot shit, arson, murder scene caution,
They don't want it with the kid, gladly get abortion,
See you niggas pocket watching, you wont get a portion,
Think I'm really slippin tho, bullets to yo organ,
Yea you niggas supa ducks yea Iâm talkin oregon,
Ride the beat no choruses, like Iâm in some foreign shit,
Kayko told me murder dat, so I went and bodied this,
Ballin like Iâm by the rim, I deserve a scholarship,
This is where I'm at today, you should come and follow him,
I be on my planet tho, come and see my mother ship,
Fuck the game and let it go, there is no more sportsmanship,
3 years with that We The Best, sorry I don't see the rest,
I don't care who comin next, you wont see me break a sweat,
Better than yo next effects, greater than yo thoughts can get,
Its me I am in the flesh, and this as good as it can get,
Man you niggas never pose a threat.
