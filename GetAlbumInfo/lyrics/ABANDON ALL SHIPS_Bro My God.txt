You are nothing but a false prophet
A sworn enemy from the day we met
Head held up higher than your eyes could see
Your source of greed lacks divinity

For all that is and whatever will be
May you all die in your animosity

Doesn't matter what is written
Life will pass you by
Cause a book full of stories
Means nothing when you die

To believe is naive
His words may deceive
To believe is naive
Fuck you I geeve

Take a chance
Don't look back

Take a chance
Don't look back
Cause time is running out
I'm in a trance
With things I lack
But don't have any doubt

Take your chance

I am your God
Not your friend
He is a fraud
Embrace the end

You are nothing
But a false prophet
