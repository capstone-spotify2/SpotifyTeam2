<i>[Hook:]</i>
Smoke sum'n, bitch!
Blow a kiss to my dick,
Wash my body with the sponge
Feed me flavored rices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-costal man we supposed to be rich

<i>[Verse 1: Action Bronson]</i>
Leave the party with your daughter (little Deborah)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais, rockin' shorts in the winter,
Don't fuck with splinters, roll with sinners
A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinner
While my drug jar look so empty
Drop a hook, and then I'll probably cop an M-3
Long nights (machete), that's an e-event
Somebody try to get me then to heaven they'll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and porche taste!
All the beans are getting boston-baked
On thin ice I skate across the lake
With the CCM tags, my feet are like Cassius,
Smoke premium cabbage

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Smoke some, bitch!
Blow a kiss to my dick,
Wash my body with the sponge
Feed me flavored rices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-costal man we supposed to be rich

<i>[Verse 2: Riff Raff]</i>
Yo with eighty thousand shopping mall
But we ain't browsing, popping hood
At tresco towers, prowlin prowler, gucci towels in bathroom viles, niles, ailes, aston-martins,
Sparking one in valet parking,
Loan sharking, hoping that my days don't get darkened,
Cheeta skin, outside the park the propaganda propellers.
Ostrich feathers, security guards with 9 berettas
Pulling up Wolkswagen Jettas
Cause a storm in sunny weather,
Sunny weather, it's sunny weather,
Hoping that my days get - hoping, hoping - days get, days get - better!
