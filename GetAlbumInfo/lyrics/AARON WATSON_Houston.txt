Well, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Oh, Houston
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through

Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you

Well, singin' at the world's biggest rodeo show
Was a great time for me and the guys
Ah, but when I'm away from you, honey
Time always never flies

And sleepin' all alone in that holiday hotel
Sure makes a cowboy blue
Ah, but here I am in Houston
And I'm one day closer to you

Well, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Oh, Houston
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through

Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you

Well, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Well, Houston
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through

Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Well, honey, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
