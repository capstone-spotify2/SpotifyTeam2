Build for me and I'll burn it down
Under siege in a fallen town

Honey believe in me for all time
Honey believe in me for all time

In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold

We can be quiet now

Pull the plug it all ends now
The endless din of a fallen town

Honey believe in me for all time
Honey believe in me for all time

In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold

We can be quiet now
We can be quiet now
For all time
Sort it out
We can be quiet now

In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold

We can be quiet now
We can be quiet now
For all time
