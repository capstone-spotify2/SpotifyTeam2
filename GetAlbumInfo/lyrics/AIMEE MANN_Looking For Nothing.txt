Macka wants to ride on the Mouse and the Tilt-A-Whirl
Canada is looking for a smile from a pin-up girl
But I ain't looking for nothing
Just spend the money I made
I ain't gotta do nothing today

Everybody's waiting for their thing just to come along
They all got something they can pin all their feelings on
But I ain't looking for nothing
Just spend the money I made
I ain't looking for nothing today

I got high on the Ferris Wheel
Didn't like how it made me feel
So alone
Another cog in the loading zone

Macka went on home when the fireworks and rides were done
Canada got busted with a girl who was way too young
But I wasn't looking for nothing
Not trouble, money or thrills
âCause when you're looking for nothing
Babe, it's not the speed that kills

Oh, I'm not looking for nothing
Just spend my money and go
I'm not looking for nothing
To put me in the rodeo
