I canât help but I wanna be around you
Canât forget about my home
When Iâm lonely
You might not know but I always think about you
As you fall upon your soul
I wanna thank you

Home is where I belong
Itâs a place, Iâm taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on

Come on down
Thereâs a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down

Youâre always around when I have some time to steal
When I need some time to heal 
For remedy (for remedy)
And there are times when itâs hard to be myself
Turn me into someone else
But you know me

Home is where I belong
But itâs a place, Iâm taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
And on and on

Come on down
Thereâs a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Stay around
Come on down
Come on down

Call on to please me tonight in a while
Just so Iâm kind when Iâm home
Days turn to seasons and years have gone by
Hold on

Come on down
Thereâs a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

I said come on down
Coz thereâs a fire in my heart
I said and youâll look down
Just I need you here right now
You gotta come on down
And bring me back to solid ground
Come on down
