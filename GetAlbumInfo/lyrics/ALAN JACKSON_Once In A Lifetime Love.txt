Some people have it
Some people don't
Some people never will
Sometimes its hard to know when you got it
Sometimes its perfectly clear
Well I know it's out there
I've seen it happen
I know the way it should feel
'Cause there's no mistakin
That good kind of achin
Of once in a lifetime

Once in a lifetime love
Love like we've all dreamed of 
it may go disguised 
right before you very eyes
once in a lifetime love

So if you think you've got it
You feel it inside ya
Don't let it slip away
You may not ever 
Find what you never 
Thought you had anyway
You've always had it
Just realize it
You know how lucky you are
To wake up beside
What some never find
A Once in a lifetime love

Once in a lifetime love
Love like we've all dreamed of
It may go disguised
Right before your eyes
A Once in a lifetime love

It may go disguised
Right before your eyes
A Once in a lifetime love
