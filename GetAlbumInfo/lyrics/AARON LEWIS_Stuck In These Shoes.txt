I'm stuck in these shoes
And I ain't a hero, or role model material
Well I'm just a man, that's tryin' to get by
And I'm stuck in these shoes

And they're made for walkin'
Let my songs do the talkin'
I'm just not really sure
How much further they'll go

'Cause sometimes I still feel like I'm losin'
And sometimes I still feel all alone
And sometimes I still feel I won't make it through this
On my own
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes
I got nothin' to lose
I've played the fool, I broke all of the rules, and I have to choose
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes

And I ain't a savior
And I ain't here to save ya
'Cause I'm not very good
At savin' myself

'Cause sometimes I still feel like I'm losin'
And sometimes I still feel all alone
And sometimes I still feel I won't make it through this
On my own
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I play the fool, I break all the rules, and I need to choose
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes
