Dearest...
Close your eyes now
Don't you cry
It's all right

Lie back
Leave the lights on
It's all right, dear

I'll be here through the night
With you till the first signs of light
Say the word and I'll come tonight

It's all right now
Don't you cry now
Hush...
Wipe your tears away
There's never a forever thing

All through the night
I'll try so hard to be there somehow
With you till the first signs of light
Say the word and I'll come 
Tonight

Darling, don't you
Cry.
