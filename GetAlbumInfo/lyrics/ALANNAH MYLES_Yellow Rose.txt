Opening slowly I sit by the water,
I'm broken
There's nothing left to say
Red, Red Roses
All but one yellow bud
The gentle thud of unrequited love...

Am I protected by this thorn in my heart?
What must I have been thinking of?
The roses of recognition
Or the yellow rose of unrequited love...

Here in the aftermath,
Hopes crashed asunder
I wonder, can I camouflage my sadness?
Begging forgiveness
I don't understand love
How could I not notice my madness?

Red, Red Roses

All but one yellow bud
The gentle thud of unrequited love...

Am I protected by this thorn in my heart?
What must I have been thinking of?
The roses of recognition
Or the yellow rose unrequited love...

Holding my head up
To fight off their glances
I shifted and picked up
My coat and my glasses
Boldly I stood up to everyone's weakness
I've lifted my spirits but still
I am sleepless

Am I protected by this thorn in my heart?
What must I have been thinking of?
The roses of recognition
Or the yellow rose unrequited love...
What must I have been thinking of?
