What do I know, where should I go
Telling me things that I can't see

Who am I now, je suis enfant
Who am I now, il y a longtemps
The light and the chill, fermer les cils
Open your ears, listening leaves

Distance device, crossing the line
Taken in kind, rÃªves jor et soir
Lost in a maze, je restais lÃ¡
Transforming views, l'esprit confus
