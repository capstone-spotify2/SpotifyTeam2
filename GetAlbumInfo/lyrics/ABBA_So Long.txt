You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
They say that money's got a magic touch,
But not to me; it doesn't mean that much.
You won't have me tonight.
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
Tracy and Daisy, they may be crazy,
But I'll never be your girl.
So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!

You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
I wouldn't keep a thing from you; I gave them all away.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
The girls might fall for everything you've got,
But I'm not one of them. You know I'm not.
You won't have me tonight.
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
Tracy and Daisy, they may be crazy,
But I'll never be your girl.
So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!
So long. So long. So long!
So long. So long. So long!
