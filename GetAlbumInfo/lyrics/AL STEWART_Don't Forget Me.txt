The sun is going down across the great unknown
Lights come on inside the towers made of stone
A muffled drum plays out of sight and all alone
Summer is over
The city lies awake and breathes electric air
The sailor in the bar dreams of a love affair
Young girls seem to shimmer in fluorescent glare
Summer is over
It's a never ending show
Faces come and go
Like a river
You're a rainbow wrapped in gray
Shake the dust away
Like a river
But don't forget me
Don't forget me now
Oh don't forget me
Don't forget me now
It's a never ending show
Faces come and go
Like a river
You're a rainbow wrapped in gray
Shake the dust away
Like a river
The crowd is spilling from the video arcade
The owner of the restaurant pulls down the shade
The thunder of the trucks is like a cannonade
But now it's over
But don't forget me
Don't forget me now
Don't forget me
Don't forget me now
Summer is over
Summer is over
But don't forget me
Don't forget me now
Don't forget me
Don't forget me now
