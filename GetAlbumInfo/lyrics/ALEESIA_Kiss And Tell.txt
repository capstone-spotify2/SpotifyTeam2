I'm just a kid
I'm feeling right
Only thing to do
Is to get to you

I wanna dance
I wanna move
I wanna feel
The way you make me do

It-it-it automatic
It-it-it so dramatic
It-it-it problematic
And-and-and I'm an addict

The way you move, baby
It drives me so crazy
You make me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

Na la de-da de-da
Na la de-da de-da

You're playing hard
I'm playing too
Know what I want
And you know what to do

I say it's on
You know it too
I gonna prove
That I'm the one for you

It-it-it's automatic
It-it-it's so dramatic
It-it-it's problematic
And-and-and I'm an addict

The way you move, baby
It drives me so crazy
You make me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

Na la de-da de-da
Na la de-da de-da

Got me under your spell
You're making kiss and tell
Got me feeling so high

Got me under your spell
You're making kiss and tell
Got me feeling so high

I don't know what it is
But it got me feeling so crazy

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

I need my oh, oh
I need my oh, oh
You're making me feel that
Na la de-da de-da

Got me under your spell
You're making kiss and tell
Got me feeling
Na la de-da de-da

Got me under your spell
You're making kiss and tell
Got me feeling
Na la de-da de-da
