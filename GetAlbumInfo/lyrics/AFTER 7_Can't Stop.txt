Last night, I had the time of my life
(It's true)
Oh last night, I made love for the very first time
(With you)

I never knew love could be so sweet
(Never knew love could be so sweet)
It never made a difference to me
(Well, well)
But ever since the day that you appeared
(Ever since the day that you appeared)
I'm telling you, you made the difference 
Now love is so clear

And I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel 
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we
And girl I can't stop
(Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we

Last night, you brought something special out of me
(Ooh wee)
And for the first time girl
You made my dream a reality
(Indeed)

I never thought love was meant for me
(Never thought love was meant for me)
For I was blind and could not see
(I was blind and I could not see)
You brought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you made the difference
Now love is so clear

And I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel 
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we
And I can't stop
(Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You're diggin on me
(On me girl)

Can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel 
Ooh I can't stop
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop the way that I feel
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we

You've got me thinking that I need protection 
'Cause your love is so strong
I don't wanna do wrong
Girl your love seems like it's true perfection
You just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we, girl
Can't stop
(Can't Stop)
How I feel
You know I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
Ooh, I can't stop the way that I feel
(Can't stop the way that I feel)
And oh I can't stop
(Can't Stop)
How I feel
I can't stop it, baby
(I wanna stop it, baby)
I can't stop
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we, girl
(Ooh wee, girl)

I can't stop
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
(Can't believe you're diggin on me)
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel 
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we, girl
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel

You diggin on me
(I can't stop)
