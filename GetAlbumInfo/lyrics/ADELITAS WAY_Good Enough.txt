I know what's coming,
You've taken me down this road before
Something's missing,
Too many times you've let me know
And I am trying,
To make it the way it used to be
Back when all you said that you need,
Was the best of me

If I gave you the ocean,
You would ask for the sun,
But if I gave you that sunlight,
You would say it's not what you want,
And I give, and I give, and I give,
But I don't give up,
There was a time,
When my best was good enough

Sometimes I wish,
I could walk away and not think twice,
I can't get past the thought of you in someone else's life,
Can I keep you if I try,
Can I make it right

If I gave you the ocean,
You would ask for the sun,
But if I gave you that sunlight,
You would say it's not what you want
And I give, and I give, and I give,
But I don't give up,
There was a time,
When my best was good enough

Can I keep you if I try,
Can I make it right

If I gave you the ocean,
You would ask for the sun
But if I gave you that sunlight,
You would say it's not what you want
And I give, and I give, and I give,
But I don't give up,
There was a time,
When my best was good enough

There was a time
When my best was good enough <i>[x3]</i>
