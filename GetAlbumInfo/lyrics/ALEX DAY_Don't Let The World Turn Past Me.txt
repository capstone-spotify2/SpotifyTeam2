Frozen
I've lost control
There's so much I can still achieve
I'm waiting endlessly
I need someone to walk me through
So I'll be safe to continue, 
Or this game's over
My credits all been spent
I was made to reach the end
Don't let the world turn past me
I'll prove that I can shine
It's all in my design
Don't let my enemies kill me
I will not lose my life 
I'll craft a star all night
To free my mind
I'll battle through my mistakes 
The level I am at right now
Isn't good enough to make me proud
Experience will help me on
I wont cheat my way to the top
No short cuts for me
My credits all been spent
I was made to reach the end
Don't let the world turn past me
I'll prove that I can shine 
It's all in my design
Don't let my enemies kill me
I will not lose my life
I'll craft a star all night 
To free my mind
I'll break out of the boundaries of my home
I'll pick out an objective of my own
This wont beat me
Don't let the world turn past me
I'll prove that I can shine
It's all in my design
Don't let my enemies kill me
I will not lose my life
I'll craft a star all night
To stop the world
From turning past me
I'll prove that I can shine
It's all in my design
Don't let my enemies kill me 
I'll craft a star all night
To free my miiiiiiind
