I like to live a little
I like to drink a little
I like to smoke a little

I like the rush a little
Misunderstood a little
We're all the same a little
Some where just born to be bad

I got it bad, bad, bad
Don't tell me what I should do or say
Cause I want to do it my own way
I don't give a fuck what you think, what you say
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad

I roll the dice a little
I let it ride a little
Out of my mind a little

I'm like a lion I'm chained
I like the finer things
Sippin' on wine I'm singing I was just born to be bad

I got it bad, bad, bad
Don't tell me what I should do or say
Cause I want to do it my own way
I don't give a fuck what you think, what you say
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad

I got it bad, bad, bad
I got it bad, bad, bad

I got it bad, bad, bad
Don't tell me what I should do or say
Cause I want to do it my own way
I don't give a fuck what you think, what you say
I got a bad reputation

Don't tell me what I should do or say
Cause I want to do it my own way
I really don't care what you think, what you say
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad

I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad
I got a bad reputation
I got it bad, bad, bad
