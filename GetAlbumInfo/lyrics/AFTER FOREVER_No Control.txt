I fight
I sweat
I drag the whole world along
I care
I break
I'm spiritless but strong
My will stands strong
I ache for inspirational and additional hearts to help me fight

Deep in my mind lies the map of my destiny
Deep in my heart lies the strength to conquer myself

In your nightmares
In your dreams lies the deepest fear
In ambitions
In belief lies the deepest strength

I doubt
Don't care
Don't see what's ever driven me
A wall
Will stand
All rending thoughts can't end
I'm paralyzed but strong
In need of comprehensible but sensational plans to fight

Deep in my mind lies the map of my destiny
Deep in my heart lies the strength to conquer myself
