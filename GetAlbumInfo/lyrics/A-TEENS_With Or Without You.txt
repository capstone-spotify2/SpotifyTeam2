With or without you
(Ooooo)
With or without you
(Ooooo)

Looking back, back in time
When you were there by my side
Suddenly, it all changed
You were not here, and it feels so strange. 

Now I gotta stop myself from going crazy
(Crazy)
I just gotta figure out how to let go
But hey,

With or without you,
I carry on...
With or without you,
I stay all night
(Ooooo)
I'm thinking about you
Everytime that I close my eyes
With or without you,
(Aaaaaaa)
I'm moving on

Remember how, how we tried
Not to let a day pass by
There's no way to comprehend
Your memory fades,
I will see you again

Now I gotta stop myself from going crazy
(Crazy)
I just gotta figure out how to let go
But hey...

With or without you,
I carry on
With or without you,
I stay all night
(Ooooo)
I'm thinking about you,
Everytime that I close my eyes.
With or without you
(Aaaaaaa)
I'm moving on

She said...
He-ey, he-ey
You gotta say what you want,
Do what you wanna do
She said...
He-ey he-ey
You gotta be who you are,
Do not let go
But, hey...

With or without you,
I carry on
(I carry on)
With or without you,
I stay all night
I'm thinking about you,
Everytime that I close my eyes
With or without you 
I'm moving on
(Oh yeah)

With or without you,
(With or without you)
I carry on
With or without you,
I stay all night
(Ooooo)
I'm thinking about you,
Everytime that I close my eyes
With or without you 
(Aaaaaaa)
I'm moving on
(On, on, on, on)
