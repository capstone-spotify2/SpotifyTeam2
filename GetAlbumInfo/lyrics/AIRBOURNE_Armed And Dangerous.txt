With a cocked and loaded gun and the girl of my dreams 
I can't control myself know what I mean 
I had one too many pills now I'm high on sextasy 
Yeah I'm a supercharged hot blooded sex machine 

Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night 
Armed and dangerous 
Oh feel my snake bite yeah 
I'm armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight alright 

I'm just checking her oil and stirring up her cream 
Bringin' her, to the boil making her jump and scream 
Say, the longer I go honey the longer I get 
And if I run out of ammo I just use my bayonet 

Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night 
Armed and dangerous 
Oh feel my snake bite yeah
