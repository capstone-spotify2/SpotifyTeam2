When you get a number one
The only way is down
And if you have a sticky patch
They start looking, start looking around

Listen close to what men say
Take what you want, what you want
What you want, what you want
And throw the rest away

In the night when things go bump
Think of me, think of me (here comes the grump)
Think of me, think of me (here comes the grump)
Think of me, think of me 
Here comes the grump

Doctors said "Adam, sex kills"
So come inside, come inside 
Come inside, come inside
Come inside and die

When you get a number one
The only way is down
And if you have a sticky patch
They start looking, start looking around

In the night when things go bump
Think of me, think of me (here comes the grump)
Think of me, think of me (here comes the grump)
Think of me, think of me 
Here comes the grump
