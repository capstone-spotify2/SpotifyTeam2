Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue

Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying just to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue

Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go you know you ought to come home
And I'll be right here little baby waitin' for you
I know you've been wild and blue

Wild and blue and it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
And they ought to just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
