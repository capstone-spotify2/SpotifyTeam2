Something so benign for me construed as cruelty 
Such a difference between who I am and who you see 

Conclusions you come to of me routinely incorrect 
I donât know who youâre talking to with such fucking disrespect 

This shitâs making me crazy 
The way you nullify whatâs in my head 
You say one thing do another 
And argue thatâs not what you did 
Your wayâs making me mental 
How you filter as skewed interpret 
I swear you wonât be happy til 
I am bound in a straight jacket 

Talking with youâs like talking to a sive that canât hear me 
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow whatâs happening 

Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body 
One day Iâll introduce myself and youâll see youâve not yet met me 

This shitâs making me crazy 
The way you nullify whatâs in my head 
You say one thing do another 
And argue thatâs not what you did 
Your wayâs making me mental 
How you filter as skewed interpret 
I swear you wonât be happy til 
I am bound in a straight jacket 

Grand dissonance 
The strings of my puppet are cut 
The end of an era 
Your discreditingâs lost my consent
