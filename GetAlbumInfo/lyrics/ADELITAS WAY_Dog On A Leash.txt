I see it coming, I'm supposed to follow 
No, I don't even want to hold the chain
If this is really what it's like to let go
It was all in my brain.. 
There's something living in the house tomorrow 
'cause you don't even wanna hold their face
Would it be of I refused to let go
It was all in my way! 

I see it coming, it's so hard to swallow
Cause I don't even want to help the chase
Too hard to sleep if you can hear the echo
Hear it calling my name...
Now I've been searching in a love so shallow
Never even wanna have the blame 
If this is really what it's like to let go
Was it all in my way?! 

It's you and it's me
Dog on a leash

I'm like a dog on a leash
No one in life, I feel it holding on
I'm like a dog on a leash
No one will stop you savin' my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me
Killing the dream
Dog on a leash

Is there a reason that you hold the solo now 
You don't even wanna help us stay
I wouldn't be if I could learn to let go
Would it all be the same! 

It's you and it's me
Dog on a leash

I'm like a dog on a leash
No one in life, I feel it holding on
I'm like a dog on a leash
No one will stop you savin' my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me
Killing the dream
Dog on a leash 
Dog on a leash

It's you and it's me, the dogs on a leash
And I can't be fine like that
It's you and it's me, the dogs on a leash

I'm like a dog on a leash 
No one in life, I feel it holding on
I feel like a dog on a leash 
No one will stop you saving my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash 
It's you and it's me
Killing the dream
Dog on a leash
It's you and it's me 
Killing the dream
Dog on a leash.
