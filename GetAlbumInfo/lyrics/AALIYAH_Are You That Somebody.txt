Boy,
I've been watching you
Like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but
You are my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you
If we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (days)
We gone hook it up
Probably talk on the phone
But see I don't know if that's good
I've been holding back
This secret from you
Probably shouldn't tell it but if I

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

Boy,
Won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone
Sleep, Sleep, Sleep
I'll be waiting there
With my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
Don't speak, you know that would be weak
Oh Boy,
See I'm trusting you
With my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you, but...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody (uh)
Tell me are you that somebody (uh)

Baby girl
I'm the man from the big Va
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland
Don't you know I am the man
Rock shows from Virginia to Japan (what)
Have people shaking shaking my hand (what)
Baby girl
Better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Making playahaters to believers
Don't you know
Gotta tell somebody 'cause...
'Cause I really need somebody (Uh huh)
Tell me are you that somebody! (Say What!)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

<i>[Pause]</i>

You can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
I'm not just anybody

Sometimes I'm goody goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
