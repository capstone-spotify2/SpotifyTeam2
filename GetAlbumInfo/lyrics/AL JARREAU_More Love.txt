I should have listened more and listened well
I should have been your shelter in the rain
I should have touched you more and held you closer
'Til I felt it melt your quiet pain

Should I have had more time to spare for you
should have been there for you, to care for you
with more love, more love

I could have given you the gifts I threw to total strangers
passing through my nights
I could have cuddled near your gentle flame
been warmer there than in these glaring lights

Should have had more time to spare for you
should have been there for you, to care for you
with more love, more love, more love

What would it have taken if only could have taken
my eyes off me for a while
I'd have seen the hurtin' hidin' just behind the curtain of your smile
oh, I swear I didn't know, which goes to show
How long it takes a man to be a man
but if I say enough
and try enough
and pray enough
and cry enough
I can still can
have more time to spare for you
always be there for you, to care for you
with more love, more love, more love needed just more love.
