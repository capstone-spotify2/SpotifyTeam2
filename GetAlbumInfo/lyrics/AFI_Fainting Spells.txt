Give me this before 
I slip, 
before I sink, 
because I think 
I may have found 
the short way down
Just give me something
Somethings cold and clear
the love spent here,
as I had feared, 
means nothing dear.
I pray to reason Il forget 
Ill trade whats left

Im the devout, 
praying just to 
get the blood out, 
bound by this flesh I own
Im the devout,
cutting just to 
get the blood out
Desecrate til we die alone

I will defy 
the pulse disguise 
but please pretend 
were still alive 
if it gives you hope
I sung and drowned,
Im taking the short way down

Just give me something
Im the devout, 
praying just to 
get the blood out, 
bound by this flesh I own
Im the devout,
cutting just to 
get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone

Give me something I can take 
to make the memories fade,
Poison kiss, remember this, 
I was never meant for this day

Just give me something
Im the devout, 
praying just to 
get the blood out, 
bound by this flesh I own 
Im the devout,
cutting just to 
get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone

Just give me something
Im the devout, 
praying just to 
get the blood out, 
bound by this flesh I own
Im the devout,
cutting just to 
get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone
we die alone
we die alone
