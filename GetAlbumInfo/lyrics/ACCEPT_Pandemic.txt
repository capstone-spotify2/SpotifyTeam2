In the cool of the evening, when the fires start burning bright
Hear the twilight callin', as the flames burst into the night
It's creeping in your bloodstream... like a Metal disease

Underneath the streetlights, everything is larger than life
Ya hear the roar, see it gleaming like the edge on a switch-blade knife
A worldwide eruption... underneath your skin
Worldwide corruption... slowly seeping in,

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's a pandemic
It's a metal disease... pandemic
Brain cell abduction, creeping in like sin, it's a pandemic...
'A metal disease... pandemic
Brain cell destruction, breeding metal from within...
Whaaaa!!!!

Give into the venom, circulating underneath the skin
Like mercury poison, liquid metal boils within
Spreading like a wildfire, burning up the earth
Caught in the crossfire, all around the world
There's no way to stop it now...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It's a pandemic
It's a metal disease... pandemic
Burnt in your hard drive, smokin' up the earth, like a Pandemic
A pandemic... it's a metal disease

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Pandemic... wow, it's a metal disease
Pandemic... caught in the barbed wire, it's underneath the skin
it's a pandemic... it's a metal disease

Pandemic
It's creeping in your bloodstream
It's a pandemic!!!!!!!... it's a metal disease
