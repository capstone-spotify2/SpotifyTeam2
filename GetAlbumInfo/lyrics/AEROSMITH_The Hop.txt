Thinkin' 'bout the night life 
In the ladies powder room 
Brother's like a howlin' wolf 
By the light of the silvery moon 
Joey's like a Pavlovs dog 
When he starts to salivate 
A hardened man himself 
Is hard to shake his rattle snake 

Me, I got a brand new babe 
You know that something just ain't right 
I say yeah, yeah 
Can't stop rockin' tonight 

Hangin' at the shopping mall 
With a watchman full of sash 
Leave your smile outside the door 
'Cause the kids be kickin' ass 
My old boot heels be smokin' 
You really got to understand 
We're burning down the town tonight 
A when the new shit hits the fan 

And me, I got a brand new baby
You know something just ain't right
I say yeah, yeah
Can't stop rockin' tonight
Yeah yeah
Can't stop rockin' tonight 

Layin' on her back tonight 
To watch the moon eclipse 
Baby eatin' out tonight 
But I just ain't leavin' tips 

So y'all best watch out what you do 
And who you do it with 
'Cause you'll be kickin' ass tonight 
With the boys in Aerosmith...yeah
