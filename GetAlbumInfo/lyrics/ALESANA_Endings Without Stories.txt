this time I die

our love ruined by your malignance
broken shards of feelings are now just tainted memories left
beautiful dreams that I cherished now are so disgusting as I strangle the light from you

I watched the smile fading from your face
you bled till there was nothing in your veins
blood stains my hands so I won't forget you
its all over now so dry your eyes
there is no forgiveness, be afraid to die
blood stains my hands so I won't forget you

tears fall as your screams of anguish rage throughout the heavens
amidst the penance you must pay
caress this bullet as eyes close to the painful memories you left
consume the rest of me
my vision of you has now turned to dust, your porcelain smile gone

I watched the smile fading from your face
you bled till there was nothing in your veins
blood stains my hands so I won't forget you
its all over now so dry your eyes... there is no forgiveness, be afraid to die
blood stains my hands so I won't forget you

you let me go
you let me go too soon
I love you are meaningless words that slip away as I slit your throat
and I will slit your throat
