If I leave in the mornin', if I do go away
If I do have a life to lead, knowin' I couldn't stay
If I leave in the mornin', if I'm gone one day
Hope I do come back to you, hope one day I stay
You know I think you know, I would never truly let go
And no matter how hard I try or how hard it is for my soul
I just had to let you know
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
You the one who down to ride
You're the savior in my nightmares
When it's darkest in the night
You the one who picked me up
When no one showed me love
You a angel undercover
Your home is up above

I've been trippin' like luggage
Ride around the city with a buzz like fuck it
Feel this buckshot yeah I know I can't duck it
But at the same time feelin' like I can't trust it
History like text books, love story text book
Don't open up my phone to even see how ya' text look
Long distant call and we still connected
Walls caved in and I'm tryin' to exit
My communication terrible, mood unbearable
And I know to you that kind of me ain't fair at all
I've been messin' up since I made the move
Expectations vs reality a hell of a truth
Don't know what I thought it would make of me
I was thinkin' of it like it was some make believe
Back home I would suffocate inside the walls
Cuz I thought when I left they would finally fall

You know I think you know, I would never truly let go
And no matter how hard I try and how hard it is for my soul
You know I think you know, I would never truly let go
And no matter how hard I try and how hard it is for my soul

If I leave, if I do go away
If I do have a life to lead, knowin' I couldn't stay
If I leave in the mornin', if I'm gone one day
Hope I do come back to you, hope one day I stay

You know I think you know, I would never truly let go
And no matter how hard I try and how hard it is for my soul
You know I think you know, I would never truly let go
And no matter how hard I try and how hard it is for my soul

Cuz if I leave, if I do go away
If I do have a life to lead, knowin' I couldn't stay
If I leave in the mornin', if I'm gone one day
Hope I do come back to you, hope one day I stay
