I keep my heart on my chest
Not on my sleeve.
Can she read my mind? 
And see right through me?
Is it to soon? 
Would everything change?
What if she don't say it back?
Oh, but what if she feels the same?

Just say it
Just say it
Stop thinking all these crazy thoughts
Look her in the eyes, be a man for once
Just say it

Life is way to short 
To be draggin' this on
If I don't tell her tonight
Tomorrow she might be gone
What if I do?
Will I lose my best friend?
Oh, but what if I don't
Oh, here I go again

Just say it
Just say it
Stop thinking all these crazy thoughts
Look her in the eyes, be a man for once
Just say it

Ooh, Ooh

Just say it
Just say it
Stop thinking all these crazy thoughts
Look her in the eyes, be a man for once
Just say it
Just say it

Tellin' her you love everything about her
You know there's no way you can live without her
Just say it
Just say it

If you listen to your heart not your stubborn head
You'd never look back on what you wished you'd said
Just say it
Just say it
A-ooh, oh oh

Just say it
