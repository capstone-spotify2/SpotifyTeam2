Sing it out, shout it loud
Cover all the earth
Let the sound of the saints
Everywhere be heard
Praise the God who has come
To cure every broken heart.

He is lord over all
His reign will never end
Through the fire and the flood
He draws his children in
He's the light of the world
Brighter than the brightest star.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The god of brilliant lights
Is shining down over us
Breaking through the darkness
Covering all the earth
Oooh, his love is like an ocean
Oooh, forever overflowing
The god of brilliant lights is shining over us

Sinners come to the cross
And lay your troubles down
At the feet of the one whose mercy will abound
He's not afraid of our filth
He will never turn away

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The god of brilliant lights
Is shining down over us
Breaking through the darkness
Covering all the earth
Oooh, his love is like an ocean
Oooh, forever overflowing
The god of brilliant lights is shining over us.

Is shining over us
Like the morning rises
God your light is shining
Shining over us
Is shining over us
Like the morning rises
God your light is shining
Over us

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The god of brilliant lights is shining over us
He's shining over us
