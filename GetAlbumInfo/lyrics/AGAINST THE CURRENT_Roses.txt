Waited all night for you to come home
I always hated sleeping alone
Watching the roses wither away
Wishing my memories would die out the same
I waited all night, yeah, you never came

I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

Everyone's trying to help me move on
They say it gets better in the long run
You could say that I've had a couple good days
But nobody's eyes shine quite the same way
I waited all night, yeah, you never came

I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

Waited all night for you to come home
I always hated sleeping alone
I hope that the lipstick I left on your face
Stays red like the roses I laid on your grave

I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Yeah, I miss it all
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
