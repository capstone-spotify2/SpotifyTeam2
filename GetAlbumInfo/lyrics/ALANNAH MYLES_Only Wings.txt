Here... here in my heart, I can see the moon on the rise
Here in my heart, a symphony of angels in flight
And if I made you feel doubt
It was my heart beating too loud
Nothing could keep me away...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Only wings... Could make this heart soar any higher
Only wings... Could chase the moon across the sky
Only wings... Could make us brave enough to fall
Are you ready to risk it all... For love...

Fear... is the only thing that lets us down
Where, are all the angels when we begin to drown

My heart is breaking inside
Like a part of me has died
It's just a question of pride
When everything stands in your way...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Heaven knows how I adore you my love
But heaven knows that angels aren't enough...

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
