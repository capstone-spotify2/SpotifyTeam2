<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Memories, in my head
I just cant stop thinkin
About you
Your not here with me
Darlin I don't know what to do
Never thought that this could ever be

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh I feel that I'm in love with you
Please don't tell me
You don't feel the same
Say you do
Cos I cant take it
The essence of you
Drives me crazy
I need you next to me
Please say you do (please say you do)
Please say you do (please say you do)
Please say you do....
Please...say you do

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Ooh
Every hour (Ooh)
All the time
I seem to look at a picture
Of you
I know its been awhile
Maybe you got a lady right now
But I gotta let you know
How I feel...

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh I feel that I'm in love with you
Please don't tell me
You don't feel the same
Say you do
Cos I cant take it
The essence of you
Drives me crazy
I need you next to me
Please say you do (please say you do)
Please say you do (please say you do)
Please say you do....
Please...say you do

I...Can't...Breathe without you
(I cant, no, no, I cant No, no)
I cant sleep without you
By my side
Come back to me
Come back to me 
Come Back To Me

Please say you do
Please say you do
Please say you do....
Please...say you do....
Hmmmm.....
