Captain, there be vikings off the starboard bow!
Attack!

'Twas off some Caribbean shore,
While on an epic quest.
We came across a strange device!

A mystic portal into another time.
Where vikings ruled the land and sea!
Such mighty treasure they did hold.
We killed them all to steal their gold!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You put your faith in Odin and Thor!
We put ours in cannons and whores!
Your viking gods won't save you now,
When the pirates strike from the starboard bow!
Back through time, to fight the viking foe!
Back through time, where our voyage must now go!
Six hundred years into the the past,
Our destiny is here at last!
For infamy and plunder we will ride!

Their ships were powerless against our cannon fire.
We took no prisoners that day! (Yahaharr)

The Vikings prayed for mercy,
As we cut their throats!
But their worthless gods did not hear their cries!

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Solo]</i>

Such mighty treasure they did hold.
We killed them all to steal their gold!

<i>[Chorus]</i>
