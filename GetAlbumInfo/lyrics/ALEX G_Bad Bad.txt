Take your empty things
Take your words and go
Take your so called change
Itâs all over now

You did a bad bad thing
And youâre a bad bad man
Cause when you thought of me
You still made your plans
And Iâm a broken thing
In your bad bad hands
You never thought of me
Iâll never understand

Take my flesh and bone
Take is all you do
Take your best and leave
Iâm glad to see you go

You did a bad bad thing
And youâre a bad bad man
Cause when you thought of me
You still made your plans
And Iâm a broken thing
In your bad bad hands
You never thought of me
Iâll never understand

You did a bad bad thing
And youâre a bad bad man
Cause when you thought of me
You still made your plans
And Iâm a broken thing
In your bad bad hands
You never thought of me
Iâll never understand
