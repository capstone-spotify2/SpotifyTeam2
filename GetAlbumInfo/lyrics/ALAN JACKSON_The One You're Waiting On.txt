Is he tall? Is he handsome?
Does he make enough and then some
Does he miss you every minute that he's gone
Is he funny? Is he witty?
Does he tell you that you're pretty
Did he hang the moon? Did he do no wrong?
Is he Mr. Right, I wonder what he's like
The one you're waiting on

'Cause there's an empty seat beside you
And every guy here's trying to buy you
Something to drink, but you just keep brushing them off
You're watching whatever's on cable
Swirling your glass on the table
Wondering how long is too long
Is he working late? Is he worth the wait?
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many minutes slip away
How many times were you gonna check your phone
I'm telling you if you were mine
You wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
You'd never spend a single moment alone
I bet he don't get how lucky he is
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many boys can you turn away
How long 'til you turn off your phone
And look up at me, I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on
I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on
