I rebuke the devil away from me
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Pray for me mama
Live, Starvation

If I should die before I wake
I pray and ask the lord for my soul to take
Niggas dyinâ everyday so I keep that Glock on me
Iâm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey <i>[x2]</i>

Man Iâm sick and tired of this bullshit
And I lost my dog and I felt like this the worst that it could get
Till I lost my daughter, felt like emptyinâ out that full clip
And I put it on my mind feel for the hand, Iâm just gonna slow sip
Cuz Iâm way to stressed and again Iâm blessed because Iâm still here
Lookinâ in that mirror I can see a man with no fear
Oh lord, oh lord this world is hell although we livinâ in it
Gotta keep my vibe. Oh why? Oh why must I just keep on sinninâ?
Tryinâ to keep it real in a world so fake, now can I get a witness?
Got niggas killing over Jordanâs, getting life in prison
Iâm tryna tell you man
Watch the ones who you hang around
The enemy approaching any second now

If I should die before I wake
I pray and ask the lord for my soul to take
Niggas dyinâ everyday so I keep that Glock on me
Iâm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey <i>[x2]</i>

Woke up early in the morning, said I gotta get it
Loadinâ up my pistol, I just pray that all my sins forgiven
And I know Iâm livinâ wrong but mama, you just pray for me
Gotta make this money so my family forever eating
That Jesus piece around my neck keep the devil away from me
In an old school cut letâs keep that problem with me on the secret
Just hopinâ right but the man above before I go to sleepinâ
In nothing lesser than a G, thatâs how they bury me
Have mercy on âem
If I should die before I wake
Pull me out some liquor when youâre at the wake
And Iâll be good as long as I know my daughterâs straight
Realest shit I ever wrote, this has a hustler's prayer

If I should die before I wait
I pray and ask the lord for my soul to take
Niggas dyinâ everyday so I keep that Glock on me
Iâm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey <i>[x2]</i>
