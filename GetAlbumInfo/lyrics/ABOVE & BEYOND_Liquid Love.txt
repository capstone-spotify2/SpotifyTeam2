I wait for you, my love
I ache for you, my love
Call this a liquid love
Rain down on me

You should have come over

Your love slips through my hands
These streets like sinking sand
Drowning in liquid love
Rain down on me

I call out your name
(You should have come over)
Your love is chasing through my veins
(You should have come over)

Such a foolish game
(You should have come over)
Your love's no good for me, good for me
But it makes me happy

Makes me happy

I wait for you, my love
I ache for you, my love
Call this a liquid love
Rain down on me

I call out your name
(You should have come over)
Your love is chasing through my veins
(You should have come over)

Such a foolish game
(You should have come over)
Your love's no good for me, good for me
But it makes me happy
