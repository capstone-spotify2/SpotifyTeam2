yeah, i can hear you even now
telling me - here's what makes this world go 'round
and again, i can see that you believe
isn't that what it means to be nieve?

think ahead, and watch your step
do your best, to make the most
of every chance, that you can get
it's in your thoughts, it's on your mind
it's in your head

hey you!  this is not your lucky day
would i lie?  no!  i'm behind you all the way
what will you do, when this thing hits you like a bomb?
you will laugh (ha!),  and you'll know that i was wrong

<i>[chorus]</i>

i don't know - sometimes i just can't believe my eyes
the things i see, things that really
mean the world to me - just falling down
and i wonder, how long will it last?
i don't know, all i know is we have got to do our best

think ahead, and watch your step
do your best, to make the most
of every chance, that you can get
it's in your thoughts, it's on your mind
it's in your head
here it comes - give it everything you've got
yeah this is it, and like i said
it's in your thoughts, it's on your mind
it's in your head
