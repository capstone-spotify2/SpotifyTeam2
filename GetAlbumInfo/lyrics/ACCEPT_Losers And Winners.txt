You told me that you like her
But she doesn't wanna know
You tried so much to take her
But there's no way to go
I know that kind of feeling
Knocking on someone's door
I know the endless crying
When you don't know what you're living for
Write a letter (what's the matter)
You'll feel better (write a letter)
You'll feel better when it's done
There is one way to show
What you feel for the girl
Write her a lovely letter
Tell her what you're looking for
Don't think it's old fashion
To take one's heart (when it's true)
You gotta take it as a man
When you can't win her in this game
Write a letter (what's the matter)
You'll feel better (write a letter)
You'll feel better when it's done
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners
Just like you and me
You should give me the letter
I'll use it for my own (haha)
Maybe she wants to take me
Before she stays alone
Could be my destination
To pick up broken heart
Why don't you take easy
And screw the girl who's next to you
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners
