Lock the door, to your room.
Pray they don't find us, pray they don't kick it down.
Oh you've been keeping secrets,
and these kind of lies have consequences.
So many possibilities for this to all end badly.
It's almost guaranteed.
Nothing but shame and paranoia.
A slightly desperate feeling to calm you to sleep.

Young flesh searing on a twin mattress.
But it doesn't have to be, the way things end.
We don't have to give up just yet.

What could we have done to deserve the violence like this?
