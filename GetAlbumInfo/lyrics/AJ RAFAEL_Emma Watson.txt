You are a star
And I'm just a nobody

You're not just a girl
You are a somebody
And I wanna be
That someone for you

You cast your spells
I watch in the movies
Can I pick you up
At 7 o clock please
Cause I wanna be
That someone for you

And I know that
It's hard for you to see
Just a normal guy like me
Can be just what you need

But if you would notice me
I'll give you everything
That you are missing can I be the ordinary guy for you
So take a good look at me
Cause I'll show you everything
Cause you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you
The ordinary guy for you?

So can I be
Can I be your secret
Just give me your heart
I promise to keep it
Cause I wanna be that someone for you

And I know that
It's hard for you to see
Just a normal guy like me
Can be just what you need

But if you would notice me
I'll give you everything
That you are missing can I be the ordinary guy for you
So take a good look at me
Cause I'll show you everything
Cause you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you
The ordinary guy for you

Oh
The ordinary guy for you

So can you notice me
Cause I'll give you everything
That you are missing can I be the ordinary guy for you

So take a good look at me
Cause I'll show you everything
Cause you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you
The ordinary guy for you
Ohh
The ordinary guy for you
Ohh
The ordinary guy for you
