There will be blood
And violence in the panicked streets
Can you feel the danger?

There will be love
Deep inside the veins of a broken heart
Can you feel the danger?

You're going down with me
Can you feel the danger?

We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Will you miss me?
We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Yeah, when London turns to dust

When I go mad
I lose my voice and everything is gone
I can feel the danger

There, there go love
To pull me back, the violence in our mind
Say I'm not in danger

You're going down with me
Can you feel the danger?

We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Will you miss me?
We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Yeah, when London turns to dust, when London turns to dust

Well, ten, ten is for the lonely hearts
And nine, nine is for the lad
Or eight, eight is for the working class
Now seven, well, seven starts today

Or six, six nights to get it right
Five nights to hold me tight, four candles glowing bright
Now three, three seconds left to town
Two stories, we're alone and oh, how you'll miss me

Co-exist through broken dreams and love
When London turns to dust (we'll turn to dust)

We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Will you miss me?
We co-exist through broken dreams and love
Yeah, when London turns to dust, no
