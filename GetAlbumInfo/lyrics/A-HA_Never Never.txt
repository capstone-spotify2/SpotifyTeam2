Come the winter, falling snow
I could swear I'll make this promise hold

I won't give you shadows
Never, never
I won't give you shadows

See me standing on a bridge in white
I watch the water being scenes by ice
Now I swear to make these words sound right

I won't give you shadows
Never, never
I won't give you shadows

And my love is all that matters
And my love is all I see
Hold me me and give all your love
Touch me and give all your love to me
Hold me me and give all your love
Touch me and give all your love to me

I won't give you shadows
Never, never
I won't give you shadows
Never, never
I won't give you shadows
Never, never
I won't give you shadows
Never, never

I swear to you I'll make this promise hold
