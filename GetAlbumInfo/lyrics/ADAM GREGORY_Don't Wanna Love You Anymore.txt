can't find no comfort in this house
in every room i feel a chill
wanna knock that clock down off the wall
cause i've got too much time to kill
kitchen faucet it still leaks
i hear its slow and steady drip
reminds me of the things i should've done
and what's too late to fix
i don't want to love you anymore
don't want to love you anymore

don't wanna see you leave everytime i close my eyes
i don't wanna hear you whisper one more sad goodbye
i don't wanna miss your touch in the middle of the night
i just wanna shut that door
don't wanna love you anymore

i found that button you lost
it was underneath the bed
and i remember how beautiful you look
unbuttoning that dress
i don't wanna love you anymore
don't wanna love you anymore

don't wanna see you leave everytime i close my eyes
i don't wanna hear you whisper one more sad goodbye
i don't wanna miss your touch in the middle of the night
i just wanna shut that door
don't wanna love you anymore

don't wanna see you leave everytime i close my eyes
i don't wanna hear you whisper one more sad goodbye
i don't wanna miss your touch in the middle of the night
i just wanna shut that door
don't wanna love you anymore
