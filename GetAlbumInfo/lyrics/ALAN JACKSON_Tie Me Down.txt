I've dodged the flame of love, my heart's been slippery and cold
I always thought I'd walk this path, 'least until I was almost old
Those sweet lips and eyes of green cut me like a blade of steel
Pull my heart like an eighteen wheel running up a Tennessee hill

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I was a rollin' stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down

Feel like I left behind, trapped to an angel's wings
Bounded to a new born love, tied up in the apron strings
I used to live alone, never needed anyone
And she turned my head around, I didn't even try to run

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, I was rollin' stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down

Lookin' back, I realize happy is not what I was
When you run across a woman, it's your true love that stronger than a moonshine buzz

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, I was rollin' stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, I was rollin' stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Yeah, I was rollin' stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down

Yeah, she was the only one that ever could tie me down
