I wonât stop till I got private planes
After that plane comes the yacht
After that yacht comes the island
Till then Iâm workingâ¦ grindingâ¦

Hey mama, hey mama, I think you and I should roll to the crib mama
Hey mama hey mama, donât bother if you gone bring the drama
Gimme something good girl balance that karma
Yellin carter hundred times youda thought it was a mantra
I wander with my gang but we ain't no mobsters
Just punks gettin lost among the genres
Manage my game stay upping my roster
Gold cleopatras, need that spirit round to open my chakras
More layin em down w less police helicopters
She my tall glass of water when Iâm all hungover
Now I need you in my life chick, wherever we going
I'll be learning the different language

I wonât stop till I got private planes
After that plane comes the yacht
After that yacht comes the island
Till then Iâm workingâ¦ grindingâ¦

Hey mama, hey mama, I think you and I should roll to the crib mama
Hey mama hey mama, donât bother if you gon get insane
My pockets rarely empty cuz we bringing that change
Margaritas in the tropics stay bringing them waves
And she didnât believe me when I declared my age
Iâm 21 with riveting content filling up the page
Iâm a whole other animal when i rip through the stage
And Iâm taking names, only way is wayland making the claims
I want a lot of hot as lava Aubrey Plazas to play
Wasnât Harvard material but that's coming my way
Now I need you in my life chick, now I need you in my life chick wherever we flying
Iâll be taking private planes in

I wonât stop till I got private planes
After that plane comes the yacht
After that yacht comes the island
Till then Iâm workingâ¦ grindingâ¦
