We're steppin' in, we're not steppin' out.
We are going to step aside, let A*Teens pick up the style.
Ah! Show them it!

The seaweed is always greener,
In somebody elseâs lake.

You dream about goinâ up there....
But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you;
Right here on the ocean floor:

Such wonderful things surround you;
What more are you lookinâ for?

Under the sea, under the sea
Darling itâs better
Down where itâs wetter,
Take it from me.

Up on the shore they work all day,
Out in the sun they slave away

While we're devoting
Full time to floating
Under the sea.

Huh, we're gonna make it so. Watch out!

Down here all the fish are happy;
As off through the waves day roll...

The fish on the land ainât happy;
They're sad 'cause they in their bowl.

The fish in the bowl are lucky,
They're in for a worser fate...

One day when the boss get hungry...
Guess who's goinâ be on the plate?

Under the sea, under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us in fricasee...

We're what the land folks love to cook,
Under the sea we off the hook,

We got no troubles life is the bubbles

Under the sea, (under the sea)
under the sea, (under the sea)

Since life is sweet here
We've got the beat here naturally(naturally)...

Even the strugeon an' the ray,
They get the urge anâ start to play,

We got the spirit,
You got to hear it under the sea (under the sea)...

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin sharp.
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of the soul
(oh yeah)

They ray he can play
He lings on the strings
He trout rockinâ out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where itâs at
Anâ Oh. That blowfish blow

Under the sea, (under the sea)
Under the sea, (take it from me)

We're what the land folks love to cook
Under the sea we're off the hook

We got no troubles life is the bubbles,
Under the sea

Under the sea, (under the sea)
under the sea, (under the sea)

When the sardine
Begin the beguine itâs music to me...

What do they got, a lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band

Each little clam here
Know how to jam here under the sea (under the sea)

Each little slug here
Cutting a rug here under the sea (under the sea)

Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
Thatâs why itâs hotter under the water
Yeah, we in luck here
Down in the muck here under the sea!! (Woo!)
