Hate me, does it feel good?
Take me understood
from this awful life i despise, throw me out in disguise
But I'll wait, I'll fucking wait for you

Here lies the waste
I will suffer, I will suffer for this taste and not forgiving

Fuck you and your love
So fake and out of touch
Can you kill me quick? close my eyes, throw me out with no surprise
But I'll wait, I'll fucking wait for you

Here lies the waste
I will suffer, I will suffer for this taste and not forgiving
