A dreaded curse - Is spoken of
By all men of the sea - An ancient tale
Of pirate's woe - And sailor's tragedy

A map was drawn - By grizzled men
Forgotten years ago - A chest of glory
And mortal sin - The none should ever know

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

A pirate captain - Of many years
Had heard these whispers grim - But lust for treasure
And endless wealth - Had all but blinded him

He hired a crew - Of hardy men
To help him in his cause - They never knew
The danger of - This bounty's evil force

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

Now stormy nights - When moon is full
Will herald in their call - A ghostly crew
Who loot and kill - 'til all before them fall
Now listen, lad - Remember this
When foul winds blow agale - Lest shadow come
And write your name - In adage to this tale
