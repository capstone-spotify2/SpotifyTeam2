It is 1999
The human race has to face it
They are confronted with the truth
It's secret - mysterious
A surgeon said it in the news
The human race is dying
But the result is no disease
Searching for you
Metal heart - metal heart
They found it everywhere
Metal heart - metal heart
Lifeless piece of steel
The scaring fact was even told
Total confusion
They found the same nightmare
Heartbeats - timebombs
Metal heart - metal heart
Unplugged they're dying
Metal heart - metal heart
Unplugged they die
Metal heart - metal heart
They found it everywhere
Metal heart - metal heart
Lifeless piece of steel
Metal heart - metal heart - metal heart
Unplugged they're dying
Metal heart - metal heart
