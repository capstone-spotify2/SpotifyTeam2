If you gave me only one wish
I wouldn't want to feel this way
They told me I'd have your memory
But all I want is you to stay
And I can't stop my mind from haunting me
It's like a scar on a butterfly's wing
I wanted you to know

This beautiful pain that I feel
Is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And leave me with the truth
And ill give you everything
If it's the last thing that I do
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
For you

If I sailed the world on stormy seas
Chasing sunlight that I can't see
I was a dreamer here before
Before I woke up and fell to the floor
And I'd climb to heaven if I could find you
Even with the scar this butterfly flew
I wanted you to know

This beautiful pain that I feel
Is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And leave me with the truth
And ill give you everything
If it's the last thing that I do
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
For you

And all I'll ever need
And all I'll ever be
Within every part of me

This beautiful pain that I feel
Is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And leave me with the truth
And ill give you everything
If it's the last thing that I do
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
This beautiful pain
For you
