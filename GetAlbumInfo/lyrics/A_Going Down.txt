Suck it up, we're going down
30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground
The passengers have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 

Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
So this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 

Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care 

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 

We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 

I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays
