And when you touch me where you touch me
When you call my name

And when you kiss me wher you kiss me
When you call my name

And we can get together and catch a movie

It's good to know we got something in common see
So if lovin' you's wrong I don't wanna be right
Because you got the thing that I like, I'm our
