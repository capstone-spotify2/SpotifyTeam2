You are my lover
My lava flow
Burn like no other
Right through the core
Just like the constellations, we shine
No wreck or ruin, our planets align

The tide and the moon yeah
You pull like the sea
In waves I can feel ya
You're My ecstasy
The lamb and the lion
We lay down in peace.
Like air to the fire
I need you to breathe

By the rules I play
By the rules I play
By the rules I play
Let nature have it's way
Predator and prey
That's the way we're made
So by the rules
By the rules
By the rules

After the thunder
Must come the rain
After our beautiful karma
Must come the pain
Just like the constellations, we fade
As blades of sunlight send, send night away

The tide and the moon yeah
You pull like the sea
In waves I can feel ya
You're My ecstasy
The lamb and the lion
We lay down in peace.
Like air to the fire
I need you to breathe

By the rules I play
By the rules I play
By the rules I play
Let nature have it's way
Predator and prey
That's the way we're made
So by the rules
By the rules
By the rules, ouhououou...

By the rules I play
By the rules I play
By the rules I play
Let nature have it's way
Predator and prey
That's the way we're made
So by the rules
By the rules
