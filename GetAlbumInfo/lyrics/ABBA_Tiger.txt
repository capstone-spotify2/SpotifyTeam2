The city is a jungle. You'd better take care.
Never walk alone after midnight.
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me!

I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
People who fear me
Never come near me.
I am the tiger.

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream.
Some of us will dream it forever.
Look around the corner, and try not to scream.
It's me!

I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
People who fear me
Never come near me.
I am the tiger.
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights.
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights.
I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
People who fear me
Never come near me.
I am the tiger.

The city is a prison. You'll never escape.
You're forever trapped in the allies.
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me!

I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
People who fear me
Never come near me.
I am the tiger.
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights.
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights.
I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
People who fear me
Never come near me.
I am the tiger.
And if I meet you,
What if I eat you?
I am the tiger.
I am behind you.
I always find you.
I am the tiger.
Tiger!
(Tiger!)
Tiger!
