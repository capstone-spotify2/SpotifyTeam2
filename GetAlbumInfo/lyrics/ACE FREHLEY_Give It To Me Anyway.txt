Oooooh Yeah!
Ow baby I need it
I want it
Give it to me!!

Girl, I've heard you've got a nasty reputation
I've been standing on my heart with an open invitation
Babe, I've been warned to stay away as far as I can
Curiosity like mine, makes me a hungry man!

I feel the time has finally come
For you, to feel the shot of my
Love, love, love, love, love gun

Give it to me anyway
I'll take you out tonight
Or any time of day
Girl, give it to me anyway
Stay with me tonight
Until the light of day

Anyway, anytime, anywhere
Ooooh Yeah!

Babe, when I see you comin' don't know which way to go
You'll just have to follow your heart, then you'll really know
Yes, I've been warned of what all the people say
To me, all this talk so cheap

I gotta have you today
I feel the time has finally come
For you, to feel the shot of my
Love, love, love, love, love gun

Girl, I'm not afraid of you
Taken my chances many times before
So, don't you be afraid of me.. noooooo
We'll have each other to much to let it go

Nothing in this world could keep us apart
And that's a promise from me to you
From the bottom
Of my heart

Woow, Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Girl, give it to me anyway
Give it to me baby
I'll take you out tonight
Or any time of day

Any time of day
Girl, give it to me anyway
Give it to me darling
Stay with me tonight
Until the light of day Oooh

Girl give it to me any way
