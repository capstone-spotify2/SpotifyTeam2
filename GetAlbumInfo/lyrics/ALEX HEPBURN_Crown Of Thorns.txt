Baby's got it bad
And she knows it
She gonna have to go and bear it
They don't understand
Gave her a crown of thorns
Now she gonna have to wear it

It's so hard to choose
Which way you wanna get you

She gives it all to the thing that she love
Over and over again
She gives it all to the last drop of blood
Over and over again
And I know what you gonna go through
Been there before
I said I know you don't have to go there
Not anymore anymore

Baby's had it high
And she shows it
In every little things she does
Tries to hide the scars
You wear a crown of thorns
It's gonna leave a mark

It's so hard to choose
Which way you wanna get you

She gives it all to the thing that she love
Over and over again
She gives it all to the last drop of blood
Over and over again
And I know what you gonna go through
Been there before
I said I know you don't have to go there
Not anymore anymore

Pain and go to hell
And gonna heal the wound that you left no
Only the stranger in the skin
Know what you're feeling

She gives it all to the thing that she love
Over and over again
She gives it all to the last drop of blood
Over and over again
And I know what you gonna go through
Been there before
I said I know you don't have to go there
Not anymore anymore
