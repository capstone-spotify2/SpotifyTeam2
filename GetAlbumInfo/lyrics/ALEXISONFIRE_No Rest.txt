We greet each day with bloodshot eyes
The dirt of our labor still clinginâ to our hands
Filled with our warped intentions
The tread of our shoes filled with foreign sands
The sun laughs in all our faces
It shows a world that we canât save
So now, armed with blades in hand
We cut a path from birth to grave

We donât know where weâre going
But we know that weâre getting there

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked

We donât think like you think
And we move like no one moves
With a song on our lips, across the land
Born to traverse
We donât think like you think
And we move like no one moves
With a song on our lips, across the land
Born to traverse

We donât know where weâre going
But we know, weâre getting there

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked

Like a car crash
Like a landmine
Like mixing drugs, we are dangerous

Like a snakeâs tooth
Like thin ice
Like mixing blood, we are dangerous

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
