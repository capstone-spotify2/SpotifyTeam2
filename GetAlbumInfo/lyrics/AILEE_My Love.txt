<i>[English Translation:]</i>

You gonna be a My Love
You gonna be a My Love

Whenever I become exhausted
Please give me a shoulder by my side
I am not afraid of anything if you are next to me
You're my boy who protects me

woo woo woo woo woo
One person who makes me laugh
woo woo woo woo woo
Only one person who will look after me

Even if we get into a fight sometimes
If you stay with me it's alright
I want to share this song for you

You gonna be a My Love
I'm so much different from other girls
I don't care what kind of watch you wear and what car you drive.

I'm not interested in any other thing.
Baby you're my love
Ma ma love Ma ma love
Love Love

<i>[Rap:]</i>
I have a light purse. I'm a plodder gain.
My house owner calls me twice a day.
But it's not weird that my cell phone breaks up.
My friends keep asking me when will I get a smartphone
âYour friends are worried about you. And your mother doesn't allow youâ
Wouldn't I be ashamed when I go to the gathering?
I'm short of careers to go out with such a nice girl as you
Let's reconsider with this reality in mind

woo woo woo woo woo You're not enough to be described in word
woo woo woo woo woo You're a person who took my mind
No one can replace you
Could you be the sunlight that shines on me
I'll stay with you

You gonna be a My Love
I'm so much different from other girls
I don't care what kind of watch you wear and what car you drive.

I'm not interested in any other thing.
Baby you're my love
Ma ma love Ma ma love
Love Love

Just be like this with me
Please smile at me even if I don't look so good
I can go miles if I am with you
Being this way at this very moment Baby you're my love

You gonna be a My Love
You gonna be a My Love

No one could replace you. I will give you all of me.
I Love You Baby
Nothing is more precious than you to me since you're my everything.

Although I am away at times
Please call my name
Baby you're my love
Ma ma love
Ma ma love
Love Love
