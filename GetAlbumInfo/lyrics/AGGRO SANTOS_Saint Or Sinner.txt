Waooohhh, in the night
I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy, Saint or a Sinner

Yo, she's a part time good girl, other time raver
Wants to be rescued, I'll be her savior
Experimental, hyper yet gentle
When I'm in a rave man I drive her mental
Straight to the center, roll no pretender
Loves to tease me, wear a la senza
I didn't think it would be like this,
But now I'm gonna give you a time you'll remember

I got what you need boy boy...
Yeah? And you do dress stylish
Plus you look good to the iris,
Off all the girls in here your the nicest
Pretty in pink (yeah), thinks how I think (yeah)
Up for a good time after a drink
Bring out the bad side ever so slightly
And the next day there's a good girl beside me

(Vamos!)
No need to decide you want a saint or a sinner
I can be both just speak what's on your mind
Two people in one, baby I'll be a winner
Just let me know and turn off all the lights
I got what you need boy, what you need boy
SeÃ±oritas come with the Santos, I got what you need
I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy, Saint or a Sinner
I, I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy boy, Saint or a Sinner

Eh baby girl, what's happenin'
Where do I know you from? I've been travellin
I've been everywhere for someone like you
But I haven't found someone that does what you do
Stay in do ya? Go out do ya?
Like a pound coin, got two sides do ya?
I wanna see a bad girl in the zone
So tell me ya left the good girl at home
Pretty in pink (yeah), thinks how I think (yeah)
Up for a good time after a drink
Bring out the bad side ever so slightly
And the next day there's a good girl beside me (ha)

No need to decide you want a saint or a sinner
I can be both just speak what's on your mind
Two people in one, baby I'll be a winner
Just let me know and turn off all the lights
I got what you need boy, what you need boy
I got what you need boy, Saint or a Sinner
I got what you need boy, what you need boy
SeÃ±oritas come with the Santos, I got what you need

Eu faco amor todo dia
Baby bring it here
Faco amor todo dia
Baby bring it here
Faco amor todo dia
Baby bring it here
Faco amor todo dia
I got what you need

Ahhhhhh Ahh Ahh Ahhhhhh Ahh Ahh Ahhhhhh...
I got what you need
I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy,
I got what you need...
I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy, Saint or a Sinner
I got what you need boy, got what you need boy
I got what you need boy boy, Saint or a Sinner.
