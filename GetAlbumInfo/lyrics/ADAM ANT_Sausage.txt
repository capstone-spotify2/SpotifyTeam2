You walk around with all that long blonde hair
I said oooh
Call me sausage

You look at me with all that Vincent Price
Stare
I said oooh
Call me sausage

And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're drinking
And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're thinking about

Call me sausage

You lie to me
You really know that's not fair
Oooh call me sausage

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone and call me
Call me, call me sausage

And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're drinking
And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're thinking about

Sausage

I call you up and you still ignore me
Call me sausage
You're acting tough and talking salty
Oooh call me sausage

And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're thinking
And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're drinking
And you don't, no you don't
Let me know who you're winking at
And you don't, no you don't
Let me know, let me know
What you're thinking
Sausage
