Don't have to be a wonder alone
Don't have to be a dog without a bone
Just come to my house, I'll be home
I can hear you

And how did you end up lost at sea?
You don't have a boat or live near a beach
But if you're in need of rescuing,
Well, I will hear you

I want you to know,
You're never alone
You'll always have a place to go
It's on a brighter side

I'll color your night
I'll lead you to light
Put hope inside for you to find

You don't have to be lost,
Lost in your own life

Lost in your own life

Don't have to have a heart that's turned to stone
Don't have to be a King without a throne
What does that even mean, do you even know?
Cause I can hear you

I want you to know,
You're never alone
You'll always have a place to go
It's on a brighter side

I'll color your night
I'll lead you to light
Put hope inside that you can find

You don't have to be lost,
Lost in your own life

You don't have to live in strife like before
No one uses the word "strife!"

Anymore
No, no, no, no, no

I'll color your night
I'll lead you to light
Put hope inside so you can find

You don't have to be lost
Lost in your own life

Lost in your own life
La, la, la, la, la
