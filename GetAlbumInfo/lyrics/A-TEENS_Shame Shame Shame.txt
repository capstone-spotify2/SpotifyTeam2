Oh
I feel somebody
And I want you to know about
You see
I want you to feel it too
So just listen to me
baby.
Can't stop me now
hear what I say
My feet wanna move
so-get out of my way
I'm gonna have my say
I'm goin' to every discotheque
I'm gonna dance
dance
dance - ooh -
'Til the break of day.
I say :
Shame
shame
shame
shame on you.
If you can't dance too.
I say :
Shame
shame
shame
shame

Shame
shame
shame
shame on you.
If you can't dance too.
Don't stop the motion
if you get the notion
You can't stop the groove
'cos you just wanna move
Got my sunroof down
got my diamond in the back
Put on your shaky wig woman

If you don't
I ain't coming back.
Shame
shame
shame
shame on you . . .
If you don't wanna go

Remember one monkey don't stop no show
My body needs action and I ain't gonna blow.
Yes
I'm goin' out
and find a dancing man
If you really think you're fast
Try to catch me if you can.

Shame...
