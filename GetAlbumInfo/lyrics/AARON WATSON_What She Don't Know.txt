She said she was not the one for me
There was nothing I could do to change her mind
She said she was sorry but some things aren't meant to be
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
What she don't know is I'll always love her forever
What she don't know is that I've never done her wrong
Underestimation will break her heart for sure
What she can't see, what she don't know
Won't hurt her but it's killing me

Deep in the shadows of the smokey neon lights
I play myself in a lonely game of pool
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side
I take another shot, swallow my pride and I play a fool

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Watching her dance with him 
Around that empty hardwood floor
Is like putting sawdust in the wound
And I cry a little more

<i>[Chorus]</i>
