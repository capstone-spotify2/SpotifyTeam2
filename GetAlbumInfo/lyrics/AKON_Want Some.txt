You just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

There goes all those things that you was saying when we were leaving
There goes all that fighting we was doing this evening
What happened to the shit that you were saying?
Oh, now you just playing?

<i>[Hook:]</i>
You just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

Ooh, you in trouble, girl
Ooh, you in trouble, girl

Cause while we spooning, you keep twerking your booty
I feel you moving and getting closer to me
And why you acting all mad?
Girl, you know you wanna do it
You get horny too fast
Girl, I can feel your fluids
Can't be mad at me forever
Girl, cause you wanna come
Oh, now you just playing?

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Cause you just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

Ooh, you in trouble, girl
Ooh, you in trouble, girl

<i>[DJ Chose:]</i>
Most nights, we don't get to sleep much
Chose eat the pussy like free lunch
But tonight, she wanna stunt like she dozed off
But she playing with that pussy like Mozart
Shawty water wet, I see no drought
I can't take her serious with her clothes off
She got her back turned to me with a fake pout
She was waiting on your boy to come and put it out
Chose

I can tell you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some
