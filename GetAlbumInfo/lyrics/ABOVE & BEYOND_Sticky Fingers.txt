We painted the picture you want
I wanted it too
But now there's something that I
Would like you to do

Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.

It's not that I'm ungrateful for
The chance to dream and then explore
But your elegant dinosaur limbs
Are still willfully bruising my skin

Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.

Get your sticky fingers out of my head 
(get your sticky fingers out of my head)
