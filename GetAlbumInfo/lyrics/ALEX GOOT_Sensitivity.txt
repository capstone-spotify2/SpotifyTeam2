I donât even know the real me anymore
I canât even show how I feel
I hit the floor
Iâm talking rock bottom
My feelings I fought âem
I canât believe itâs come to this
Cause I need to a grip on reality

Yeah, Yeah

Now I-uh-I-I-I wanna feel some, some sensitivity
I-uh-I-I-I Iâm here, Iâm telling you I

Cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
Iâm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
Itâs my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity, yeah
I stepped back from the edge
Now Iâm living it up again

Yeah

Iâve been doing fine in my misery
Not crazy
I told them not to worry about me

But every time I-uh-I-I-I wanna feel some sensitivity
Iâm here, Iâm telling you I

Cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
Iâm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
Itâs my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity
I stepped back from the edge
Now Iâm living it up again

Living it up again
Living it up again
Living it up now Iâm not crazy Iâm just sensitive
I stepped back from the edge

I cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
Iâm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
Itâs my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity
I stepped back from the edge
Now Iâm living it up again

Living it up again
Iâm living it up again
Living it up now Iâm not crazy Iâm just sensitive
Living it up again
Iâm living it up again
Living it up now Iâm not crazy Iâm just sensitive
