On a planet not so far away
We were born together
In the beginning there was just you and me
Where we was washed up
Upon this river
Suckle on the honey of the Tennessee
Where we would sleep
In the soft sunshine
I smile at you and you to me

And in the dark
I see the moon shine in your eyes
We were strong and tall as weeds
Never live forever, there
No such thing
I looked at you, and you looked into me
And we saw in each other, everything
We knew no fear as we grew the years
That's the growing up, we've come to love

On this planet not so far away
We wouldn't stay together
Rolling in a dream
We'd drift apart, on down the stream
Like honeysuckle tangled up in kudzu vine
The snake that lay in the sun, so fine
I saw the true you and you, true me

And in your eyes
I'd see the dark inside of you
Woke from dreams
Pulled up like weeds
Never knew no better
There was no such thing
I reached for you like a child that clings
Oh, how we saw in each other, everything
Everything
Everything
