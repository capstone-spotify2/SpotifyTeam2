I know a girl with a broken smile
He's been hurting her for quite a while
But she loves him
She still loves him
I've got a friend with a heart of gold
He loved his wife even when he was told
She's unfaithful
He still faithful

I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know

Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it

I've seen a man working all his life
Lose his job to a new device
Still he's grateful
Yeah, he's grateful
I know somebody who's got all they need
Who built an empire stepping on the weak
Still ungrateful
So ungrateful

I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know

Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it

Who decides this?
It seems so unfair
Is there somebody
Somebody out there?
Who decides this?
Does anyone care
Is there somebody
Somebody out there? <i>[x4]</i>

Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it
