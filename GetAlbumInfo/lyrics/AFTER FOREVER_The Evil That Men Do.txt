Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

The evil that men do lives on and on.... <i>[4x]</i>

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
But I will pray for you
And some day I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

The evil that men do lives on and on.... <i>[4x]</i>

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

You know <i>[x2]</i>

The evil that men do lives on and on.... <i>[4x]</i>
