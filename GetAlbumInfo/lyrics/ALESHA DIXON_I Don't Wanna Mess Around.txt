No, no, no, no
The time I tried to wait you caught me in the spell I'm under
I don't ever wanna shed no tears over yo-o-ou
There's somethin' in your face, you look so fine
I wanna let my (unknown) fears behind
Trust you, hope that you will to-o-o

Quietly alone
I'm figurin' out
What's a girl to do
And now I don't wanna show you everything
You got a lot to prove
Quietly alone, I'm workin' out
What's the deal with you
I wanna carry on, baby you're the one that I, I'll put my trust in you (no, no, no, no)

I Don't Wanna Mess Around, pretendin' I don't need you
Just wanna be with you oh
Baby I wanna please you (no, no, no)
I Don't Wanna Mess Around, pretendin' that I Don't care
