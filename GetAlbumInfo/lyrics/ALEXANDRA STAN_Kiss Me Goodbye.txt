Do you remember?
It was last summer
When you told me all those little lies
I realized your freaky motions were just alibis
Why didn't you call me?
To say you miss me?
That you thought about me day and night
Cause without me, there's no color
There's just black and white

Now I think it's time that you should know what I'm about
Boy, I'll try to help you figure out
There's so much you're missing out, so hear me out

Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame
Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame

You thought that you'd still be, driving me crazy
Played with fire once, I know it burns
There's no magic trick that you can do to make me turn
You can stop trying, won't be replying
You better know that I am so much more
Since I freed myself from everything we had before

Now I think it's time that you should know what I'm about
Boy, I'll try to help you figure out
There's so much you're missing out, so hear me out

Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame
Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame

Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame

Dame la, dame la
Dame la boca, besame
Dame la, dame la
Dame la boca, besame

Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame
Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame (Ã¡ndele)

Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame
Kiss me goodbye, bye, bye
Kiss me goodbye
Dame la boca, besame
No, no me tocas, besame

Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame
Dame la boca, besame
