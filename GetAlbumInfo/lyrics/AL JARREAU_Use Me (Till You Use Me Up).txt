Well, my friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
Well, my answer said all that use me stuff
Is I wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Uh huh, until you use me up

Well, my brother, you know he sit me right down and he talked to me
Well, he told me, that I ought not let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well
But when our talk was through
I just said: Now, brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me
Well, you get me in a crowd of high class people
And then you act real rude to me
But oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
When you love me I can't get enough

And I wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Talking 'bout you using me
Well, it all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me
'Cause I sure am using you
