I turned out the lights
Layed down my pride
But she never said goodnight to me

She just closed her eyes
And waited while I watch her just fall asleep
So tell me why, oh why?
If there just aint a cloud in the sky?
Why? Oh why?
If feels like rain
It just feels like rain baby

Everyday day and every night
I try and I try to just be youre everything
The light of your life
That you hold on so tight
To protect you from anything

So tell me why, oh why?
If there just aint a cloud in the sky?
Why? Oh why?
If feels like rain
It just feels like rain darling
If feels like rain
It just feels like rain

If we hold on to something
If we just let it slide
We can make it to everything
Cause baby youre all that i want
Youre all that I want little darling

So tell me why, oh why?
If there just aint a cloud in the sky?
Why? Oh why?
If feels like rain
It just feels like rain darling
If feels like rain
It just feels like rain

Oh I wanna love, I wanna love you....
