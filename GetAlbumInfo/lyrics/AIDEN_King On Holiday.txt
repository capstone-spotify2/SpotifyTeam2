This open letter read,
"I'm gone on holiday"
Started off as a secret headline.
"The king has passed away"
Goodbye to the world.
Goodbye to the pain.
Goodbye to the screaming children.
Your hero passed away.

Hey, Hey, Hey!
If you ever caught a glimpse of hell, would you kill time?
(All the lives are torn)
Hey, Hey, Hey!
If you ever caught a glimpse of hell, would you kill time?
(Every bastard mourns)
Hey, Hey, Hey!

I was born,
Try to suffer this fame.
I sold my soul for dirt.
Goodbye to the legend Elvis.
Goodbye to this whole shit world.

Hey, Hey, Hey!
If you ever caught a glimpse of hell, would you kill time?
(All the lives are torn)
Hey, Hey, Hey!
If you ever caught a glimpse of hell, would you kill time?
(Every bastard mourns)
Hey, Hey, Hey!
If you ever caught a glimpse of hell, would you kill time?
(Would you kill yourself?)
Hey, Hey, Hey!
