Tell me where did they go
Your hugs, your kisses, baby I gotta know
X's and O's
Tell me where did they go
I'm fuckin' missin' these X's and O's

I'm feelin like Kanye, no not the old Kanye, obsessed with goals Kanye, no time to hold Kanye, how much we sold Kanye, like where's my soul Kanye, been obsessed with the next can't say I live in today, I been writing for weeks I leave my present on page, I been stepped on and slept on I finally broke out the cage, log in check my statistics we doin thousands a day, been half heartedly sorry my heart just ain't been in the same, I'm focused you know this I'll be in Sweden in May, get the team in the studio blow the whole world away, used to dream bout dreamin like this, you don't like this at all, destiny callin my name but yours I struggle to call, my shine be higher than ever I'm petrified of the fall, if I don't work every second then I ain't workin at all, wish I could love like I used to, wish I was strong for us both, ice in my jack that's just the way that I cope

Outta sight outta mind, there's just too much on the line, not enough time in the day and not enough of its mine, bout to get that level that I been searching to find, told you how I been feelin while the world is thinking I'm fine, cause this fame isn't money and this life isn't free, I know how I been feeling, and what I'm feeling ain't me, I'm more concerned with my come up than really feeling complete, I see less of reality more I'm living my dreams, I ain't got time for you, I barely got time for me, I'm out here making the moves being who my family need, promise you when I get it that I'll be here if you need, but I know you're losing hope in who you want me to be, I got a hole in my heart, i got a glitch in my soul, Got a couple screws loose inside this mind that I own, but I'm here holding the gun, I rewired my soul, and I'm the one with the Philips head twistin left with it so
