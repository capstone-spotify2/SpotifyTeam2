She must need somewhere to stay tonight
She's not right all alone
She must need somewhere to play tonight
She's so tired, I should know

She's a reckless, drama, senseless and she feeds like a leech
She's so my records that her best friends always bitching at me
Oh, she must need something from me tonight (me tonight)
In the blink of an eye

She's a blur (blur, blur, blur, blur)
I'm only happy when she's leaving
Tell myself I'm living a (blur, blur, blur, blur)
Call me crazy, I'll be leaving
She's so not like the other girls
She's a blur

She must need someone that's weak tonight
That's alright, moving on
She's a distant memory in life, I'll get by on my own

She's got arrested while it end and now she's better at be
And the sentence is she never got the better of me
Oh, she must need somewhere to sleep tonight
In the blink of an eye

She's a blur (blur, blur, blur, blur)
I'm only happy when she's leaving
Tell myself I'm living a (blur, blur, blur, blur)
Call me crazy, I'll be leaving
She's so not like the other girls
She says she's not like these other girls
I think she's right, I think she's worse
I can't describe her, there are no words
I can't describe cause she's a blur

She's a blur (blur, blur, blur, blur)
I'm only happy when she's leaving
Tell myself I'm living a (blur, blur, blur, blur)
Call me crazy, I'll be leaving
She's so not like the other girls
She says she's not like these other girls
I think she's right, I think she's worse
I can't describe her, there are no words
I can't describe cause she's a blur
