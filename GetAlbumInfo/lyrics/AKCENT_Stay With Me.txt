I remember the prison of all memories
And I'm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I was so crazy
All the time I made you cry.
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I tried to hide the pain,
But all I see is you
How can I do it?
I don't have a clue.
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I remember the prison of all memories
And I'm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I remember a voice
That was calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I was so crazy
All the time I made you cry.
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I tried to hide the pain,
But all I see is you
How can I do it?
I don't have a clue.
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I remember the prison of all memories
And I'm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me Stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I remember a voice
That was calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I remember the prison of all memories
And I'm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down

I remember a voice
That was calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me stay with me
Baby, when the lights go down...
