I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?

Does the grass look greener on my side of the speakers?
I tried a couple weekends, but that green's not for me
I thought I'd get clever
Make my lyrics come out better
But at 7/11's where you would find me

Don't wanna get paranoid 
Just wanna be makin' noise
You wanna hit?
It's your choice
But please enjoy the show

I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?

Last night at the concert
The audience it flickers
They're lighting up like Christmas 'til that greens not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain't no concern of mine
I keep doing me

Don't wanna get paranoid 
Just wanna be making noise
You wanna hit?
It's your choice
But please enjoy the show

I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?

I'm not narcissistic
I'm just high off the music
And I don't wanna miss it
But I wouldn't stop you
I'm not narcissistic
You light up 
If you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you

You just keep doing you like

I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's 'cause I'm the one on stage
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that's because I love to play
So, who am I to take away what makes you feel this great?
