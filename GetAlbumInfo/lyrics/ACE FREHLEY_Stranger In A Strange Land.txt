I got a feeling inside
About to drive me half wild
I'm not afraid of it
Kinda like the taste of it!

We're gonna get it on tonight
Things are feeling oh so right
It makes me tingle inside, so gimme more, gimme more

I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, kinda like the taste of it
You really got to understand
I'm not abusing it, girl, because I'm choosing it!
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, want a little more of it

It's only ten o'clock
Really fell the need to rock
I think I got it now
No one has to show me how

I'm feeling more at home
I don't feel the need to roam
Everything is in the right place
So gimme more, gimme more

I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, kinda like the taste of it
You really got to understand
I'm not abusing it, girl, because I'm choosing it!
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, want a little more of it

When the feeling is right, there's no need ot fight
I'd rather make love to you
So come along for the ride, don't wanna see you hide
You can please me, while I'm pleasing you, yeah

I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, kinda like the taste of it
You really got to understand
I'm not abusing it, girl, because I'm choosing it!
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it, want a little more of it
