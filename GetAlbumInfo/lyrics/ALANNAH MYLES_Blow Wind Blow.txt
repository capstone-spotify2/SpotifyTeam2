Blow wind blow all my worries
Away from me
Blow wind blow a little heaven my way
Blow wind blow a little heaven my way

Day goes down
Upon this dirty little town
You gotta find another lonely soul
To share the night

So may you never end
All my sweet and ragged friends
Won't you raise your glass, your voice
And your will to fight

Cause your life belongs to you

Love's unkind
It'll make your heart unwind
You gotta send a message
To yourself to carry on

Burnt out and broke
Another romance in smoke
You better love a little bit of
Somethin' that'll make you strong

Here's a song to see you through
Yes a song will see you through

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Blow wind blow all my worries
Away from me
Blow wind blow a little heaven my way
Blow wind blow a little heaven my way
<i>[2x]</i>

Life comes true
In spite of,
Everything we do
You gotta, learn to love
When the joke is played on you

The great unknown
Will make you shiver to the bone
You wanna close your eyes
And pretend you're not alone

Here's a song to sing you home

Yes a song will sing you home

<i>[Chorus 4x]</i>
