Sometimes, yeah, sometimes
It gets hard trying to reach my goals
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes
I pretend like I'm real close
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes
I have to put my life on all
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes
I can't dream because
I'm still woke

(I'm still woke)

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
My life is music, when I hit that mic I gain control
Speaking purely through my soul when my minds in over load
For so long I was cold, I mean my heart was froze
Treadmilling emotions how the fuck was I suppose to grow
But how the fuck were they supposed to know that my ambitions had me dissing those creating distance from me and my goals
I was so bitter, feeling like I was the runt of the litter
But now I deliver like Dominos dinner, go call me whatever but can't call me quitter
I'm stuck in my work, they all wanna be eaten but then they dessert
Wasn't here in the kitchen I ate and did dishes why they here for dessert
They tryna wife the game but all they ever do is flirt
I give my heart, I give my soul I swear I really put in work
Now they look up to me, we see from the same height on the same earth
Walk the same ground through the same dirt, live the same love and the same hurt
Cause I'm still woke, but my dreams keep teasing me
They ask when I'm gon blow up, but that ain't up to me

Still woke screaming what the hell I gotta do
Where the hell I gotta take it just to get it through to you
Switching states, constant moves, I even been switching crews
That's the way it happened but it's not what I wanted to do
Remember talking bout the top, talking how we'd make it
Earthquaking when we hit the ground, till the day we make it
Kept it concentrated while they watered down, that's why they hated
Till I make it learn to simulate it neo in the matrix
Struggle rappin not by choice but where I'm at I should rejoice
Rollin through the city with the crew screaming we them boys
We up next like we with khaled called it feelin we the best
Girls want me signing there's by gettin weight up off my chest
God and I may disagree, but these days I been feeling blessed
Pretty crazy how this life is mine
Still woke but I'll get my shine, bored, broke, you know I still grind
Maybe one day I'll wake up find I was dreaming the whole time
