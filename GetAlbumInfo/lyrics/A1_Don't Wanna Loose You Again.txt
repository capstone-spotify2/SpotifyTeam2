I can feel that the wheel is in motion
And there's life in this old timer yet
Looking back there's a new reflection
Now I know what you give is what you get

In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
âCause I don't wanna lose you again

Now I bet that your ears are burning
With three words on the tip of my tongue
I just hope that your heart is open
So that I can undo what I've done

In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
âCause I don't wanna lose you again

Like a star, it's so hard to reach you
Not enough just to call you a friend
And I know that I don't deserve you
But I don't wanna lose you again, oh

In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
âCause I don't wanna lose you again
No, I don't wanna lose you again
