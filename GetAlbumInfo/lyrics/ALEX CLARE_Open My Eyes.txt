It's been a lot to know
Beyond my capacity for rational talking
Show me. Can you show me?
I daze a lot to understand
But I'm just a simple man and I'm stuck in the sand
Won't you help me? Won't you help me?
Oh, there's so much to take in
But there's nothing going out I don't want make a scene
Can you help me? Just help me

I would open my eyes if you would ask me to
I would open my eyes if I thought it would do some good
I would open my eyes if you would ask me to
I would open my eyes if I thought it would do some good
If I thought it would do some good

Had do I explain mistakes that you've been making?
It might it's time to change
Can you tell me? Won't you tell me?
Oh, crucial situations have heart illusion
Don't need a revolution in there
Not again
No, they don't really work
Just someone has to fill the void left behind when they go
When they go

I would open my eyes if you would ask me to
I would open my eyes if I thought it would do some good
I would open my eyes if you would ask me to
I would open my eyes if I thought it would do some good
If I thought it would do some good

I would open my eyes
If I thought it would do some good
I would open my eyes
If I thought it would do some good
I would open my eyes
If I thought it would do some good
I would open my eyes
If I thought it would do some good
