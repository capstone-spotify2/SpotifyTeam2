Hey, beautiful farm on the top of the hill
Whenever I pass by
I'm thinking I will
Find someone like you
Goodbye avenue
And then I'll be yearning for this too

Over the treetops fly
Birds in the sky
Over the treetops high
High in the sky

Stop calling her restless
She moves in the sun
Gets out of the bed past noon
Closer to one
I follow her mind
I follow her blind
She leaves and I'm two steps behind

Over the treetops fly
Birds in the sky
Over the treetops high
High in the sky

A trip is a fall
To fall is to trip

She changes how she feels
About things, that's okay
It works for me
I think I like it that way
No thing is true
Some thing is false
Address the child as a whole

Over the treetops fly
Birds in the sky
Over the treetops high
High in the sky
