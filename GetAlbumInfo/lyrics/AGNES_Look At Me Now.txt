And I finally understand that I don't need your hand
I know I can be happy with who I am
Look at me now, look at me now

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I tried my best gave you what you wanted
I gave you everything I could give
You didn't care and took me for granted
That's not I bout wanna live
You thought that I'd fall apart without you
You say that I'll come and call back in time
You didn't think that I'll dear to doubt you
But I made up my mind

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Look me I'm so much stronger
Look at the way I've spread my wings
But I can't believe I haven't thought that you were the one that I need
Look at me, you see me smiling
No one is gonna bring me down
You didn't think that I'll survive it
Baby just look at me now

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
You say you're different and now you realized
That you were crazy to let me go
If for a while there were tears in my eyes
I'm standing here on my own
So if you're thinking I'll reconsider
And take you back again for one more try
I'm moving on and know I'm not reader
This is the last good-bye

<i>[Chorus]</i>

And I finally understand that I don't need your hand
I know I can be happy with who I am
Look at me now look at me now
