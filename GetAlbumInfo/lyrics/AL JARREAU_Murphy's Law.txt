It's too good
It's too right
So something must be wrong
It's a bubble
That's gonna break
Says Murphy's Law

I need you
I want you
Been alone too long
If it might miss
It's gonna miss
That's Murphy's Law

And the perfect fit just
Rubs my worry stone
But if it works don't fix it
Ya leave it alone

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
'Cause you're the only luck I need
You make it go
You're the only luck I need
To make Murphy pass my door

We put something on baby
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we, didn't we
It's so sweet
I repeat
That something must be wrong
If it might not
Then we must stop
And talk about it

It's a work of fiction
They call it a law
But the contradiction
Is we fooled 'em all

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
You're the only luck I need...
...You're the only luck I need
You make Murphy tell and show
You're the only luck I need...
...You're the only luck I need
To make old Murphy pass my door

If it works don't fix it
The winner takes all
You know it's the Murphy fiction
That's due for a fall

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
