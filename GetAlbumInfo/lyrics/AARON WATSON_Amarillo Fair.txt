I've never won a bear throwing a ball at the tri-state fair
I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
You were laughing at me and looking mighty dandy
Licking your lips and your cotton candy
I fell in love with you right then and there
When I saw you at the Amarillo Fair

Time stood still as we rode the Ferris wheel
There I was on top of the world
I said that I've been known to be accident-prone
So I asked you if I could hold your hand
That night I stole a kiss on the tunnel of love
And to this very day I still can't get enough
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair

My hearts a tilt a whirl since I gave it to you girl
I don't want this ride to ever end
Corn dogs and barbecue a frosted funnel cake and you
All made that night to good to be true
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair

I've never won a bear throwing a ball at the tri-state fair
I still can't hit the broad side of a barn
I've never won a thing till I gave you a diamond ring
Now I'm the luckiest man in the world
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
