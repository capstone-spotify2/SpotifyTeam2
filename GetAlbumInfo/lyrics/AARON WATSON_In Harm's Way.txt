Like that old Titanic 
Running full steam ahead
You fogged up my mind
With love words you said
I could not see the danger
I got myself in
Till my ship was sinking
And I couldn't swim

I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way

Now the door went under
In an ocean of regret
With no hope of rescue
From love I can't forget
I never knew just what hit me
To far gone to say
I never knew my heart 
Was in harm's way

I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way

I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way

I didn't know my heart 
Was in harm's way
