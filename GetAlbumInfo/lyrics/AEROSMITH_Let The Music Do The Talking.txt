Rock-a-bye baby 
If you wanna dance 
Grab yourself a body 
And take a chance 
Said one time around 
Is all you get 
I'm still dancin' 
So you lost your bet 

I got a hardcore mama 
With a hot hoochie coo 
Make my wheels start spinnin' 
Like a formula two 

Got one for the money 
Two for the show 
Three for my honey 
And four to let you know that I... 

Let The Music Do The Talking 
Let The Music Do The Talking...'cause I can't wait 
Let The Music Do The Talking 
Let The Music Do The Talking 

Cheese cake 
Maybe if I take another bite 
I'm a real fat city 
I'm an aero delight 
Threw out my pipe 
And my alkaline 
Got a squeaky clean body 
And a dirty mind 
I'm a real fine dancer 
I'll be cuttin' the rug 
Got a brand new baby 
She's my brand new drug 

I got one for the money
Two for the show
Three for my honey 
And four to let you know that I...

Let The Music Do The Talking
Let The Music Do The Talking...'cause I can't wait
Let The Music Do The Talking...I gotta get it
Let The Music Do The Talking...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...yeah

Yak yak yak 
yak yak yak yak yak yak yaou 

Let The Music Do The Talking

Let The Music Do The Talking
Let The Music Do The Talking
Let The Music Do The Talking
