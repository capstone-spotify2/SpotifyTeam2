B-b-b-b-better! B-b-b-b-better!
B-b-b-b-better! B-b-b-b-better!

I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!
I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!

<i>[x2:]</i>
I can feel your love is real,
But I know that you're making me sick!
Boy, you're serving me your poison meal
And I know that you're making me sick!

I am like a bittersweet pie,
Filled with love and also denial.
When you're not around, everything goes down,
Everything goes wrong with me!
When you're not around, everything goes down,
Why in hell you cannot see?

<i>[x2:]</i>
I can feel your love is real,
But I know that you're making me sick!
Boy, you're serving me your poison meal
And I know that you're making me sick!

I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!
I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!
Without you.

You are like a bittersweet pie,
But you are filled with cream and the cherry top lie!
When you're not around, everything goes down,
Everything goes wrong with me!
When you're not around, everything goes down,
Why in hell you cannot see?

<i>[x2:]</i>
I can feel your love is real,
But I know that you're making me sick!
Boy, you're serving me your poison meal
And I know that you're making me sick!

I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!
I think I'm better, I think I'm better,
I think I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-better!
Without you.
