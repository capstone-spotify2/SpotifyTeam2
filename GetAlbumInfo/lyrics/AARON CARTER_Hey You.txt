You got your hands in your pockets
And you walk real slow

Wanna tell you what I want
Wanna try, wanna see
Hey you, hey you
Whaddya say, whaddya say

Hiding away. Hopin' that you'll call me
I can't seem to get you off my mind
There you are, standing on the corner
You said "Hi, I lost your number.
Gimme a sign!"

I know you really wanted me baby
