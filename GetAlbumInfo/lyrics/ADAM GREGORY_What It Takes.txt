What makes you hurt? What makes you smile?
What calms your nerves? What drives you wild?
I wanna know, I wanna understand
What it takes to be your man

What's your favorite color? What's your favorite song?
If I sing it to you would you sing along?
I need to know, I gotta understand
What it takes to be your man

What you want, what you need, baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know, so that I can be what it takes to be your man

What makes you cuss? When do you pray?
Is your daddy your hero? What would your momma say
'Bout what I need to know? I need to understand
What it takes to be your man

What you want, what you need, baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know, so that I can be what it takes to be your man

What you want, what you need, baby tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know, so that I can be what it takes to be your man

Oh, what it takes to be your man
