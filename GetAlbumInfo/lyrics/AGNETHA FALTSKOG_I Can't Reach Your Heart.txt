I can't reach your heart 
You're near but yet so far 
Am I reaching for a star 
Am I aiming too high

I can't reach your heart 
Can it be that you don't care
I'm not getting anywhere
Though I try and I try 
I've told you so many times 
I'm in love with you
Oh, what more what more can I say 
I wish I knew

I can't reach your heart 
We can't go on like this 
Though your lips are mine to kiss 
I can't reach your heart 

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

Though your lips are mine to kiss 
I can't reach your heart
