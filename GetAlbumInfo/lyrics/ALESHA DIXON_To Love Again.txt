All this time I felt so lost, lost and needed help.
Incomplete, out of reach, All alone by myself.
It all becomes so clear, when I see your face.
And it's only when you're near, I feel I'm safe.

So before we take this road, before you change my mind,
Fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time.
I've been torn apart, desperately try to find a way back to my heart,
So I can love again.

Ooh, help me love again. Ooh yeah.

I'm so tired of holding on, so tired of waiting.
I need to feel something real, without it breaking.
It all becomes so clear, when you touch my hand.
And it's only when you're near, I know you understand.

So before we take this road, before you change my mind,
Fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time.
I've been torn apart, desperately try to find a way back to my heart,
So I can love again.

There's a fire within me, but I don't know where to stop. There's light beginning. There's a dark kind leaving there's a hope I'm feeling now

Oooooohh yeah!

So before we take this road, before you change my mind,
Fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time.
I've been torn apart, desperately try to find a way back to my heart,
So I can love again.

Uuuh, yeah.
Turn the page to love again.
