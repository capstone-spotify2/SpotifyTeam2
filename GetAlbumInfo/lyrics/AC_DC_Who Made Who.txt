Video games she play me
Face it on the level but it take you every time on a one on one
Feel it runnin' down your spine
Nothin' gonna save your one last dime
'cause it own you
Through and through

The data bank know my number
Says I gotta pay
'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you round the world
There ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you, yeah

Who made who, who made you
Who made who
Ain't nobody told you
Who made who, who made you
If you made them and they made you
Who pick up the bill and who made who
Who made who
Who turned the screw
Yeah

Satellite send me picture
Get it in the eye
Take it to the wire
Spinnin' like a dynamo
Feel it goin' round and round
Runnin' outta chips
You got no line in an eight bit town
So don't look down, no

Who made who, who made you
Who made who
Ain't nobody told you
Who made who, who made you
If you made them and they made you
Who pick up the bill and who made who
Ain't nobody told you
Who made who
Who made you
Who made who
Who made who
Yeah
Nobody told you
