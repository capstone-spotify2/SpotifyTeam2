Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made

Then went down to LA
They roped 'em in
She couldn't get away
Spending cash all about
The die was cast
There's no burning out amount of money made

Work work money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work work money made
Work work money made
You keep it up, you get it made
Work work money made

Can't bring me in to Hollywood
See you livin' it up
It feels mighty good
Recommendations all around
Come taste the sweet life
That's what it's all about
That money made

Work work money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work work money made
Work work money made
Keep it up, you make the grade
Work work money made

That money made
Hit the gas

That kind of life is good for her
Getting outta bed nearly half past four
Her swimming pool is the biggest about
So don't you call her 'cuz she ain't around
That money made

Oooh, money made
Oooh, that money made

Work work money made
Work work money made
Shake it baby shake it
Shake baby shake
Shake baby shake
