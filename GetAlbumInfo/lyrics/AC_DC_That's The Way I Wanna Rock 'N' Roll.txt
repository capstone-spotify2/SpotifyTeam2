Party gonna happen at the union hall
Shakin' to the rhythm till everybody fall
Pickin' up my women in my Chevrolet
Glory hallelujah gonna rock the night away
I'm gonna roll roll roll
I'm gonna roll roll roll
I'm gonna take this town turn it around
I'm gonna roll roll roll
Now there's a blue suede boppin' on her high heel shoe
Rollin' round together like a wreckin' crew
Be bop a lula baby what I say
Ya gotta get a dose of rock 'n' rollin' each and every day
We're gonna roll roll roll
We're gonna roll roll roll
We're gonna take this town turn it around
We're gonna roll roll roll
I'm gonna blow up my video
Shut down by radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way

That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way that's the way
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way that's the way
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way that's the way
To rock 'n' roll

Roll, roll, roll, I got roll, roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town turn it around
I'm gonna roll roll roll
I gotta roll, that's the way I want it
Roll, roll, roll, gotta hear it now
I'm gonna take this town turn it around
I'm gonna roll roll roll
Blow up my video
Shut down by radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
That's the way I wanna rock 'n' roll
