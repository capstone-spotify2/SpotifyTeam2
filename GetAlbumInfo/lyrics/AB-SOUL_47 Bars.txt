This verse was ghost written by Capital STEEZ
Iâm high cause I fly with Lorianaâs angel wings
Not cause I smoke weed, we in the era of the Pros
If you peepin' this your speaker Is worth 47 Karat gold, Soul
Yo, correct me if I'm lyin', you got a Hublot, but we both know
You still check your iPhone to tell the time
Only time will tell, you're atomic as my microscopic
You tryin' to spit a verse, I'm trying to crack the microcosms of the universe
It's all Mathematics!
I multiply division like I was fitted for glasses
The difference between me and you is
All you do is subtract, all my tracks sub
To sum it up that ain't adding up, I've had it up
To here with this shit I be hearin' These Days
Marvel Comics' superheroes in capes with marbles for brains
But I'm the Peter Parker in this World Wide Web
Spider senses tingling, move like I have 8 legs
I got next, cause I show them how to use their head
Rip the arms of a grizzly with my bare hands
I bet you play dead and I bet they think
That I'm delivering babies the way I bring in the bread
And I hate to address it but niggas wearin' dressses now?
Hey, it do cost a lot to live this here lifestyle
Cash money talk, bullshit walk a million miles
And I don't even write, where am I supposed to draw the line?
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd actually be Rapsody
Half of these niggas sell pussy after the
Top Dawg that mastered this craftsmanship
Ain't cop these Margielas to go back to the ave then Crip
To make you more jealous cause now we getting paid per view
Cash stacks in the plasma, that's a Pay-Per-View
And I still remember what Pac's Pop told us
"Keep your enemies close nigga, watch your homies"
And it's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, troll your insta
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
My little sister just did molly for the first time
While I'm rolling with models, forgetting I'm a role model
Who else you know who shot across the whole nation
No MTV Jam or radio rotation
So don't ask me about Kendrick and Q
Jay Rock, Zaywop and SZA's sexy ass too
Cause I was thinking Long Term before I met them
I've been through Hell and back I deserve Heaven
And I thank all of yall who supported the 'These Days Tour'
For 47 cities there's 47 Bars
And this is the 47th bar
