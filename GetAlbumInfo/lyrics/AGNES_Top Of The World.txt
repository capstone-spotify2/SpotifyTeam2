(If you were mine, boy...) (wailing) 

You get my heart beat beating like a drum 
I'm going crazy baby insane 
What would it take for me to be your number one 
Just let me know cuz baby I'm game 

<i>[Speaking voice:]</i>
Up an down you make me go 
Like you don't even know 
How much I want you, don't ya see that 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you were mine boy 
And I was yours 
We'd be on top of the world 
(So baby talk to me, talk to me) 
Give me your time boy 
I'll be your girl 
We'll be on top of the world 
(So baby come to me, come to me) 

I'm so addicted to the things you do 
You've got my number won't you call me? 
I've been so nervous waitin' for your move 
So tell me do you see what I see 

<i>[Speaking voice]</i>

<i>[Chorus + overlay]</i>

Now when I dream, I dream you'll take me in your arms 
If I wake-up at night and you're not by my side 
Boy I wonder were you are 

If you were mine (If you were mine) 
If you were mine (ooooh yeaaah) 

<i>[Chorus 2x (impro/variation + overlay)]</i>

If you were my boy friend 
I could be your girl friend 
We'd be on top of the world 
If you were my boy friend 
I can be your girl friend 
We'd be on top of the world
