I'm a modern privileged gay
You spend most evenings on your back
Disposable income everyday
I think itâs time that we both give back,
Turn off Doctor Oz,
Ride a bike for a good cause,
Raise some dough for our friends who are pos

Training, sweating - that shit hurts.
Feel the wind blowing in your hair
Trading in our mini-skirts
For some fashionable active wear
I still donât see the appeal,
Plus I canât ride a bike in heels
But just think how good youâll feel
I can make my rump hurt better for a weekend

Get your ass to San Francisco,
Then ride down to LA.
Safety first so wear a helmet.
Bitch I said âNo way!â
How âbout I ride a flat-bed?
Iâll look cute and pay for gas.
Cause you know I love a road trip,
But Clif Bar tastes like ass.

Youâre a shady fucking drag queen.
Probably going straight to hell.
But then you do a little AIDS ride.
...And the PR goes well.
I'll look like a real good person,
With generous charity ways.
Oh, Iâll make a stank face baby,
But Iâll ride for AIDS.

Are you a Starbucks lover, Willam?
(I donât know what that means)
Is there WiFi on this thing?
I will beat you with your selfie stick!
Young man, sexual body wear,
Plus the Lycra shows off his dick.
Oh my gosh! The view is right.
I will bike all through the night.
Pitch a tent it feels so nice.

So each mile that I go,
Makes the donations pile on up.
Plus we get free Gatorade.
Can I get some backup in myâ¦
Shut your mouth youâll swallow a bug.
Itâs a nice break from drag and drugs,
Plus I get to shake these big jugs.
(I knew we shouldâve asked that Aussie whatshername to come.)
