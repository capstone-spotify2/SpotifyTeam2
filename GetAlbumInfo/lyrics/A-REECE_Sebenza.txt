Hello

<i>[A-Reece:]</i>
Fede why o saya sgela?
I see that you online and esale 10
But that ain't why I really called
I didn't mean to bother, mare nna ke tlala ka wena
I couldn't hold it in, ke khale re chatta
Going back and forth about how breaking love
And how we never saw each other as friends
Bafethu baka bare you just pretending
Haba di bale so don't worry about it
I ended up telling them that you just ain't ready
Ao nchaele osa blama Pearly
Ke shapile dry o nose teng

But anyway we need to talk about this
Coz anyway I think you really 'bout it
Airtime ya fela hake batle nkhate
But just know I can't wait to feel your body

<i>[Amanda Black:]</i>
I really want to say
I want you too
But I can't tell the truth it will be too easy
If you really want me
You gotta know my love ain't mahala
Sebenza Sebenza Sebenza
My love ain't mahala
Sebenza Sebenza Sebenza
My love ain't mahala babe

Why o arabe phone?
You know that I call you alone
I even know your ringtone and I know oyi one at home
Mamazala o chaisa ka bo 7
And am sure msizo otswile ho jola till bo ma 11
Invite me over ke zokale ke goetse monate esale nou before eba 10
Let's play some music and close all the curtains
Beat beat you until you swerve out your back
And bring it out in reverse

But anyway we need to talk about this
Coz anyway I think you really 'bout it
Airtime ya fela hake batle nkhate
But just know I can't wait to feel your body

Sebenza Sebenza Sebenza
