Oooohhh

You know that I would follow you
To the end of the Earth
And maybe I was kinda bold
You shoulda known my worth

I was waiting for the time to remind you
We were in love
What I gave was so incredible
But it was never enough

You took my love
And broke my heart
You took my smile
And tore it apart
You left me crying
Down on the floor
The funny thing is
I still want more
If only you love me like I wanted you to
But you trick me into loving you
You tore me apart
You broke my heart

You charm me with your little ways
You knew the buttons to press
And you said I was your everything
But boy you couldn't care less
And you said we'd be together forever
Now look what you've done

What I gave was so incredible
But it was never enough

You took my love
You broke my heart
You took my smile
And tore it apart
You left me crying
Down on the floor
The funny thing is
I still want more
If only you love me like I wanted you to
But you trick me into loving you
You tore me apart
You broke my heart

All that I needed
Was someone to hold me
And all that I wanted
Was someone to show me
Just what it is to be loved
And I hoped that someone was you

Oohhhh

You took my love
And broke my heart
You took my smile
And tore it apart
You left me crying
Down on the floor
The funny thing is
I still want more
If only you love me like I wanted you to
But you trick me into loving you
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You tore me apart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
