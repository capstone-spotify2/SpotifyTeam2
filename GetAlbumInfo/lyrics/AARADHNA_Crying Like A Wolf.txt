Every night I sit by the window
Crying like a wolf cause your love's gone
I didn't mean it when I said that I hate you
Know that I love you

And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you

I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf

I'm thinking to myself â who's loving you now?
The thought of another is making me break down
I didn't mean it when I said it's over
Please don't say it's over

And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you

I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf

Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Howling at the moon and I hope that you can hear my call
Come back to me
Said come back to me

That's the sound of the beat of my heart, boom boom
Hoping that you will hear my call
I'm howling at the moon, I hope you hear me baby
Hear me baby
