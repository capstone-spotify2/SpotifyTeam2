There's no frost on the windows,
It's always eighty degrees,
Everybody is beautiful
and there is always an ocean breeze.

They got palm trees and white sand,
Moviestars and Malibu,
Got everything that a man could want
Well everything but you.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warmer
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.

I bet back home its snowed,
You're good and warm in your bed.
I wonder if you miss me,
Cause I just can't get you out of my head.

I haven't seen you in so long,
But I still feel you so strong.
This place looks so right,
But feels so wrong.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.

Three in the morning
And I can't sleep,
And if I could you'd be in my dreams.
Laying here without you I'm not me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.

That's the trouble with California.
That's the trouble with California,
You're not here.
