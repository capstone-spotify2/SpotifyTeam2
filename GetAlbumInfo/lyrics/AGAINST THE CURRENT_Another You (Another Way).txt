I wish there was another you, 'nother way
And I just can't find the words I should say
If I wanna tell you how I feel, how I feel
Without breaking all that we've made

But they say life goes on anyway
If things should change, oh yeah
Stuck in the same old melody, of misery
And don't you remember

All of the times we spent late at night
We wasted our breath
We're over and done with
I couldn't see what you did to me
It's not for the best
We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night
The last thing that I ever wanted to do
Was to say goodbye to you

Tell me if it's right or wrong, right or wrong
Staring at your pictures till the shadows fade
Acting like there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong
What we had is slipping away

But they say life goes on anyway
If things should change, oh yeah
Stuck in the same old melody, of misery
And don't you forget that

All of the times we spent late at night
We wasted our breath
We're over and done with
I couldn't see what you did to me
It's not for the best
We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night
The last thing that I ever wanted to do
Was to say goodbye to you

You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
But I can't keep on
Living life this way
You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
Yeah...

You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
But I can't keep on
Living life this way
You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
I'll find another you another way

All of the times we spent late at night
We wasted our breath
We're over and done with
I couldn't see what you did to me
It's not for the best
We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night
The last thing that I ever wanted to do
Was to say goodbye to you

You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
But I can't keep on
Living life this way
You say that I
I'm the one who's changed
I'll find another you another way
