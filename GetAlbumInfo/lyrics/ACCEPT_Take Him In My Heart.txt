Once upon a time
There was a girl so young and sad
And holy prayers blessed her sleep
Before she went to bed

Her body was imaculate
Her hair was shinning gold
With twenty still a virgin
For a virgin rather old

But no one could imagine
How the girl would need a man
She dreamed about a man all night
So sadly - so sadly

Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't exist for you
Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
If you don't know where's your way to go

One morning she was feeling bad
And didn't go to school
She went to town to find a man
Who fucks her very cool

Moving hard and randly
She was walking down the street
Suddenly she saw a man
The man she dreamed to meet

Hello guy, you're looking good 
Don't you think it's allright
To love me now - I need a man
So badly - so badly

Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't exist for you
Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
If you don't know where's your way to go

The man looked in her eyes
And took her kindly by the hand
I want you help you, babe
But I can't understand

Why don't you leave your castle
And try to live your life
Without your holy prayers
You will do it always right

You think you are the greatest
And whole world is your own
For ever you will feel so good
So happy - so happy

Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't exist for you
Take him in my heart - it's a long way to start
If you don't know where's your way to go
