In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight

Like the moon glowing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, in the still of the night

Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight

Like the moon glowing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, in the still of the night
Of the night, of the night, of the night
