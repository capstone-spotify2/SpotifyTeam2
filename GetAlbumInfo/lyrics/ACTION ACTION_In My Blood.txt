There's a war inside my head
I need you alive
Oh my God Oh my Lord
I've deceived the deceivers and fooled the believers

Hold your breath Hesitate
To the fit
Your fix yesterday
I've been up beaten down
To the sounds of my song out of time

I've lost control
And when I think about what all went wrong
It was what a change into you
(whoa-oh)
S-surrender s-surrender My Love
It's in my heart it's in my blood
It's in my heart it's in my blood

There is life
There is death
And death is just a frame of time
Placed your bets
Doubled down
Everythings meant to be broken down
And how

I've lost control
And when I think about the thoughts I know
It was what a change in mind for you
(whoa-oh)
S-surrender s-surrender My Love
It's in my heart it's in my blood
It's in my heart it's in my blood

I've lost control
But I'm not sure what I've lost at all
It was <i>[?]</i> so just forget about it
Oh just forget about it
Oh just forget about <i>[?]</i>
What a dream
What a scene

S-surrender s-surrender My Love
Its In my heart it's in my blood
It's in my heart it's in my blood
S-surrender s-surrender My Love
It's in my heart it's in my blood
It's in my heart it's in my
