Maybe I have waited for too long
Maybe I got caught up in the storm
And I sent you off so incomplete
Now your lonely call is haunting me

And it's all over the world
Your call lost in the wind
You soar over the world
Your call over the world

All over the world

I've tried untethering my despair
Tried to forget and not to care
But the ropes that hold me are of stone
And your call it cuts me to the bone

And it's all over the world
Your call lost in the wind
You soar over the world
Your call over the world

All over the world
All over the world
It's all over the world
All over the world
