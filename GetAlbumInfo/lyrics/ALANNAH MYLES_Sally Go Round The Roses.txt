Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses

The roses they can't hurt you
I know the roses they can't hurt you

Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
The saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown

Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses
