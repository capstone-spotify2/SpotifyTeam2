Hey...hey...hey...whoa...whoa...
Oh...

You can think that I'm just playin' games
You can think I'll do you wrong
You can think that I don't mean a word I say
You can think what you want (What you want)

But if you think you're gonna stop the way
I feel about you
Baby, you're just wastin' your time
'Cause I'm not changing my mind

Can't stop the rain from falling down, oh
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round, oh
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

You can trust that I'm gonna stay around
You can trust I'll treat you right (I treat you right)
You can be sure that I won't ever let you down
Sure as there are stars in the night (In the night)

And if you ever think there'll come a day
I'll live without you
Baby, you're as wrong as can be
Can't change the way that I feel

Can't stop the rain from falling down, oh
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round, oh
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop a river running free, no
Can't stop this love I feel in me, no
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop the wind, can't stop the sea
Can't stop the feelin' I feel in me
Night needs the stars, stars need the sky
And I'll always need you here in my life

Oh, oh, oh
Can't stop my love, can't stop my heart
I'm in too deep, I've gone too far (Oh...oh...)
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop
Lovin' you, oh, oh, oh

But if you think you're gonna stop the way
I feel about you
Baby, you're just wastin' your time
'Cause I'm not changing my mind

Can't stop the rain from falling down (Just can't stop the rain)
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round (Can't stop, oh)
Can't stop my heart from loving you (My heart, baby)
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop a river running free
Can't stop this love I feel in me
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop the rain from falling down (I'm here by your side)
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round (I'm gonna love you forever)
Can't stop my heart from loving you (Can't stop my heart from loving you)
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby
