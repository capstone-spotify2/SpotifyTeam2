You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come all
Devil's Carnival
You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come all
Devil's Carnival

Welcome to my gates
You gay and lucky souls
Get your tickets
Form a line
You can't help help but fall
From my humble hole

O, those grapes of green
Hanging down from Heaven's vine

You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come all
Devil's Carnival
You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come YOU
Devil's Carnival

As your ordinary sinners
And extraordinary ones
Bring your brothers
Bring your fools
And daughters if you got 'em
They're a lot of fun
Bring the whole damn family
Cause my belly's never full

You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come all
Devil's Carnival
You're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come YOU
Devil's Carnival

One little blind mice
Scurry down the trail
Chop goes the farmer's knife
Coming for your tails

At bedtime tales and fables
For your greedy hearts
Some have razors 
Some have keys
How they end depend 
On how you play your part
Fortunately how you played your part
Has got you here

Sing a song of six-pence
A pocket for our king (a pig for our king)
Sire, let me hold the reins 
While you pluck your fiddle-strings

(Na na na-na na)

Keep your hands and arms
And legs and head
About you at all times
Use discretion 
Stay alert
And pick the pace up, tortoise
As a gate smacks your behind
Welcome to eternity
Now eat your just desserts

We're in the Devil's Carnival
Come one, come two, come all
Devil's Carnival
You're in the Devil's Carnival
You can't help but fall
Devil's Carnival

You can't help but fall... 
Devil's Carnival
