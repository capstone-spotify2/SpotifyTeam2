<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
So baby hollah at a G
I keep you away from prankstaz
You can be my mistress, I can be ya gangsta
Seen you on the money rockin bring me back the paper
Give you back half just for doin me dat favor
And yeah dats a thug's move
Show you what a thug do
Beat it while I feed it to you good like soulfood
Forget about old dude, call him Mr.used too
I can put it down like the top of my new Coop
Baby dats roofless
Tell ya what the truth is
Niggahz can't hit it right
Den baby he useless
I'm a yung thug, give it to you with my Chews on,
Shoes on, just incase a yungin gotta move on

<i>[Chorus: Lloyd]</i>
When at home all alone at nite
Cause dat otha niggah ain't lovin you rite

You spendin money on dat buddy ain't hood
And no worries baby it's all good

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
And though he bought you dat watch
Ya man ain't nothin
So hollah at a G if you need some thug lovin
Late nites on a call say she wanna feel sumum
She tell me put it down

I give her refunds and her body keeps cummin
She know I put it down baby girl stop runnin
So what you wanna do cause I'm yung and still thuggin
Jus take this good while I'm headed to the money
Takin shots of the goose just to mix with gettin blunted
See I can brighten days keep ya wrists all studded
Ya boyfriends' lame tell'em Guttah get money

Dats why you keep comin rite back

<i>[Chorus: Lloyd]</i>
When at home all alone at nite

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
And baby I can show you new things
Sumum u ain't used to
Kick it with the guttah none otha you need a thug dude
Type of niggah beat it in his jeanz and his Tim boots
Hit it from the back, see you feelin like fruit juice
Fitted to the back, see he can eat what ya man do
Ain't doin his job, you can hit me on the hip boo
Ace
You know the name
A real niggah
Heavy off in the streets, see ya man, I'm a deal with him
Baby he play it lock like the Tommy The Hilfiger
Call me ya boss boy or just call me ya deal giver
Heard you needed a thug so there go ya meal ticket
Baby girl don't worry I'm dat hurry and get it like

<i>[Chorus x2: Lloyd]</i>

And no worries baby it's all good
