Where will we go?
Where will we go?

Sign away all of my decisions
Choke me when I breathe
Too many opinions
I gave away my freedom to please you
Let them talk so they feel important
They don't mean a thing, this is my own dream
Why do you have to put this on me?

(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess
(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess

Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want

Life's a game, so don't complain
You can't obtain, figure out how to maintain
It's a shame, make a change
So life will never ever bind me down
Found out just what it's really all about
Never doubt, I wish I could get out
Why do you have to put this on me?

(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess
(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess

Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want

Find a way
<i>[Repeat]</i>

(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess
(Where will we go?)
I'm a mess

Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
When the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
