I should have known, 
That your wings were sewn. 
Fell down from his throne. 
Sins heavy as stone. 
You'll die alone (you'll die alone) 
You'll die alone (you'll die alone)
I should have known, 
That your wings were sewn. 

I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
Call me insane, but my life or yours. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
But my life or yours, I'd rather fucking die. 

I know you meant well 
But your love is not kind. 
I bet burning in hell 
Was not on your mind. 

Fly with me, to the place where angels go. 
To the place where angels go. 
The place where angels go. 

I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
Call me insane, but my life or yours. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
But my life or yours, I'd rather fucking die. 

I'd rather spend an eternity in hell, 
Than go to heaven without you (without you). 

I should have known, that your wings were sewn. 
Fell down from his throne. Sins heavy as stone, you'll die alone. 
I should have known, that your wings were sewn. 
(i should have known)
Fell down from his throne. Sins heavy as stone, you'll die alone. 
(i should have known)

To the place where angels go.
