I went outside to take a walk
So I could relive memories
I thought that you would lend a hand
But you were never ever there
It's all in your mind
You do what you wanna do

Your promises are all played out
You've got your wish you've worn me down
I treated you the best I could
I realize that I don't need you

I lost my way when you left home
I thought that you could change your life
What did I do why do you lie
You've walked back in my hands are tied

I'm tired I'm so damn angry
With you
Your not gonna change
I see who you really are

Your promises your promises
They're all played out
Your so played out your so played out
There all played out
