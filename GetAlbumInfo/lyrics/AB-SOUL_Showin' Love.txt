<i>[Intro:]</i>
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Pants still saggin' to the floor, saggin' through your turf
Like I own this fuckin' earth, I saw my fuckin' life
I'm just livin' fuckin' life, This ain't house Party 5
But what's poppin' for tonight? I got a 'lil more dough to spend
This Rest in Peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smokin' y'all jokin', Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm tokin'
Bomb House on Skid Row ain't this potent, holy shit
I'm God-Sent, admire my skit, callate la voca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right, true achiever, new ADIDAS still tryna earn my stripes

<i>[Hook:]</i>
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit <i>[x2]</i>
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
It's easy to assume we doin' decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
Were you the Prius, sure it's one, it's two, it's 3
You'd have this music down to a Tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a Ki, it's only one in Ab -Soul
Still open do's, Don't forget the dash
I might leave you with a gash, I ain't doin' no more shows unless I'm gettin' cash
Feelings full of Hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put the llama on the map
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complanin'
And everyday I'm rainin' got the most precipitation
Soul-o, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, where's your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch and pry patience
And watch us pop across the population

For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit <i>[x2]</i>
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Do that shit, we done that shit
You new to this, we run that shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clownin' when you see me
Stylin' jokin', smilin' sculpture poker face, through these black shades (Smokin' on Haze)
In the middle of the bar, at least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 &amp; 38 (Great)
