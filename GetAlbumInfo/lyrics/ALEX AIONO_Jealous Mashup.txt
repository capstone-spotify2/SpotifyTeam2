You're to sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why I still get jealous

I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
Oh I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than my shadow
Oh I'm jealous of the wind

I wish you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive

I always thought you'll come back
And tell me that all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

I don't like the way
He is looking at you
I'm starting to think, you want him to
My crazy have I lost you
Even though I know you love me
Can't help it

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting ready to face you
You call me obsessed
It's not your fault
That they hover I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish, yeah

And I always thought you'll come back,
And tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I still get jealous
So jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I still get jealous
It hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
