There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know
It isn't time, no
But could you be m-mine?

We'll never get too far
Just you, me, and the bar
Silly mÃ©nage Ã  trois, sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh baby, light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Give you fever, fever, yeah

There it goes
You're still my soul and so
'Cause, sweetheart
No-no-nobody a-kno-kno-knows me
Or can find me, ooh
Time to be m-mine, mine

Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of mÃ©nage Ã  trois, sometimes 
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh baby, light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Give you fever, fever, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
You baby, oh baby, oh baby, yeah, oh baby, you're mine! 
Baby you're mine, mine, you're mine

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh baby, light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
I got this fever that I can't sweat out

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh baby, light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Give you fever, fever, yeah

Give you my f-f-fever, my f-fever
Give you my f-f-fever, my f-fever! 
Give you fever, fever, yeah
Give you fever, fever, yeah!
