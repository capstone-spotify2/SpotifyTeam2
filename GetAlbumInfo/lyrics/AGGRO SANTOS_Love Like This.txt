I feel your touch when we connect on the floor 
After I find you watch you got me wanting it more
My friends tell me to leave her but my heart isn't sure
I've never had a love like this before  
<i>[x2]</i>

Yeah, I meet lots of women and that made me a villain 
You're not the same so a pool side killing 
Vamos la Vamos a boom bam widdum 
Girls in la ropa dance to the rhythm 
Fest and fiesta, drinks in my system 
This girls got me wishing 
Back to mi casa, drinks in the kitchen
Tom Cruise. Man on a mission.

I love the 4 by 4 
Bass
As it drives me to the floor 
I'm safe 
I wouldn't wanna be in any other place 
Let's stay face to face 

I feel your touch when we connect on the floor 
After I find you watch you got me wanting it more
My friends tell me to leave her but my heart isn't sure
I've never had a love like this before  
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

You're mine, mine
Single for one at a time
No stress, just love all the time 
RosÃ© or champagne, that's fine 
Yo girl, let's get this party all-nighters full
And time to party strong 
Everybody loves a party some
Too many girls 
Aye aye aye 

I love the 4 by 4 
Bass
As it drives me to the floor 
I'm safe 
I wouldn't wanna be in any other place 
Let's stay face to face 

I feel your touch when we connect on the floor 
After I find you watch you got me wanting it more
My friends tell me to leave her but my heart isn't sure
I've never had a love like this before  
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I've never felt like this
I'm sure, I'm on the edge 
And I'm wanting your more 
Put your hands up, let's explore
Come on and ride if you like tonight 

I feel your touch when we connect on the floor 
After I find you watch you got me wanting it more
My friends tell me to leave her but my heart isn't sure
I've never had a love like this before  
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I've never had a love like this before 
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I've never had a love like this before
