<i>[Hook - Aloe Blacc:]</i>
I'm gonna get in my car
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me

I admit I play hide and seek with the violence
String theories together just like a violin
Red roses, blue violets
The top pick in the cockpit
That's fly shit
Like defecating on a private plane, it's simple
G4 with it, women with me
In the present, here's a test
If you tour the future then the past represents death
Life, will it take me under? I don't know
The good die young and the ugly get dough
I feel this prickly feeling on the back of my neck
The reaper tippy toe behind me everywhere that I go
That's why I ride slow, I used to be in a rush
Fast life, slow motion
These days, I'm so focused
And as soon as the chauffeur hold this door open I'ma

Here's a tiny tip
There's no escapin' the trouble that come with this grand hustle
You willin' to give everything for the glistenin' wrists
Findin' the right fabric to keep your family knit
Vanity slave, runnin' red lights, smokin' weed, they in love with you
When you're untouchable, sonny
You was born to fuckin' die, 'til then get money
The belly of the beast ain't no tummy, you mistaken
Track record longer than a train station
You just record tracks, what a waste of wax
Name an individual exempt
From a candlelight vigil and bring me his head
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Optimistic but they say I need an ophthalmologist
Now they just look at me like they owe me apologies
So many red eyes I might need Visine
Audio pilot, that's why I'm so high up
The trouble still finds us like a citation, that's why I'm hatin'
The waitin' and silent conversation with God like
Why the Hell is Heaven so far?
Don't need a stairway, I need a rocketship to blast off
So what? No buts, I work my ass off
And all my champions comply
It's do or die when I ride, Tracy Chapman didn't die, nah

I'm gonna get in my car, I'm gonna drive real fast
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me

<i>[Aloe Blacc:]</i>
No more, no more, no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
Said I don't want trouble to find me no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
