Well take a ride, just us alone
Well find our answers on the road
The keys to my car are sitting on the table.
It wont be you and me no more
Well finally get some time to explore
It sounds like a plan were willing and were able

When were driving in the fast lane maybe
Well find a better way
To deal with our troubles baby
But until that day
Well go our separate ways and stop counting the days
Could you see a way out other than this?
Could you see a way out other than the road?

Its better this way, get used to it
Stop holding on to what cant be fixed
Times are hard and they dont get easy til you discard
Everything that meant something to you

When were driving in the fast lane maybe
Well find a better way
To deal with our troubles baby
But until that day
Well go our separate ways and stop counting the days
Could you see a way out other than this?
Could you see a way out other than the road?

The road becomes our lives per se.
In some sort of metaphorical way.
Everything amounts to something 
we could never try to disassemble
(like some kind of a riddle)
take your time, you must try. 
Its your call, end it all
and were just caught in the middle

When were driving in the fast lane maybe
Well find a better way
To deal with our troubles baby
But until that day
Well go our separate ways and stop counting the days
Could you see a way out other than this?
