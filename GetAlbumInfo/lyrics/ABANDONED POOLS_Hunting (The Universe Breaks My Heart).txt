Ginny I know what love is now
I know what we could be
This time it will be different
This time you'll be happy

Stupid twisted irony
You know what your heart is worth
Cause I'm the one who trampled it
And pushed it in the dirt
In time we'll see what grows

I've been hunting through forests 
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home

Ginny I know what love is now
Give your heart for me to keep
This time I wont ruin your life
Or drink myself to sleep

Maybe we could settle down
And plant a tiny family tree
I'll rid myself of what troubles me
And set my little mind free
In time we'll see what grows

I've been hunting through forests
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home
I've been building the tallest sky-scrapers
I've been spinning the earth the other way
I've been adding the numbers
I have got to find a way to bring you home

Ginny I know what love is now
I know what we could be
For what it's worth I love you
If its just too late for me
I've got only me to blame
I've got only me to blame

I've been hunting through forests 
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home
I've been building the tallest sky-scrapers
I've been spinning the earth the other way
I've been adding the numbers
I have got to find a way to bring you home

In time we'll see what grows
In time we'll see
what grows
