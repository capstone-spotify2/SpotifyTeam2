Inflation, starvation,
I need another occupation
Everybody's got a hand out now ....âhard luck"
Hey buddy can you spare a dime
Can't take any more frustration,
Every day there's a new temptation
L gotta find a way to live ....."hard luck"
Why is it such a crime

We all need a little compensation
All I want is a real vacation
No money gotta pay the rent ......"hard luck''
The check is in the mail
But YOU get your tax deduction
Outsourcing mass production
No work it's no surprise ..... "hard luck"
It's all gone to hell

They wanna bleed us dry
I think we've had enough

Stand Up ..........Join the Revolution
Don't take it anymore
Stand Up .......... Join the Revolution
Right now ..........Join the Revolution

What's wrong, with this picture
The poor get poorer and the rich get richer
Banks ready to foreclose ..... "hard luckâ
Occupy the streets
Get up, take action, be a link in the chain reaction
It's time to unify ..... "stand up"
Get up on your feet

They're trying to bleed us dry
I think we've had enough

Stand Up .......... Join the Revolution
Don't take it anymore
Stand Up .......... Join the Revolution
Right now .........Join the Revolution

<i>[Solo]</i>

Stand Up ..........Join the Revolution
Don't take it anymore
Stand Up ..........Join the Revolution
Right now ..........Join the Revolution
Get Up .......... .. Join the Revolution
Don't take it anymore
Stand Up ..........Join the Revolution
Right now ........Join the Revolution !!!
