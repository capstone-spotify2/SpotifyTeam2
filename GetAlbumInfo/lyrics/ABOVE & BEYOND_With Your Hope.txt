Connected to talk
singing through a forest of ice
This slow motion moment is tumbling down
Till we're lost inside the sound

It's your worst fall
you push me through the walls
And I just can't cope
You're breaking my heart with your hope
Youâre breaking my heart with your hope

Youâre breaking my heart with your hope
Youâre breaking my heart with your hope
