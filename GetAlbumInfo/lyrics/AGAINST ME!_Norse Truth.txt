Tits out for the boys...
Hard cocks...
Hard cunts...
Line 'em up...

Walking on broken glass while holding my breath
I wouldn't dare step on a single crack
Dig up you bones, early graves are not homes
If you're looking for revenge, well here's a fucking pound of flesh
Just because I can intellectualize, it doesn't mean I feel it in my chest
Just because I can taste it doesn't mean I sink my teeth into it
Always dogs running, always dogs dead
Just grinding down axes till the last cigarette

All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
But it wasn't...

Come on... shape shift with me...
What have you got to lose?
Fuck it...

Well there's a killer on the loose, insomnia, Christ-fucker, rape me
Unwashed and unclean, these statements not untrue of me
We used to be cocaine and Xanax, now a kiss isn't worth the lipstick
Where there once was love there now is nothing
The easiest way to untangle a knot,
Just forget I was here, cut me out of your heart
Your body is not a stranger to me
How can I look you in the eyes
When I have known you so very intimately?
New drawers for new secrets, new without's to sleep with
A practiced detachment to perform, numbness as art
You're free to do nothing, go ahead and rot
Menthol crush you have faded from me

All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
But it wasn't...

Always starts with a Galaga in a bar
And ends in a broken heart
Last cock you suck to the last cunt you fuck...
I'm forever your girl...
Please, please, please, say that you love me?

All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
All the places that we never went, all the times we never had
I want them back now, I want them all back
I wanted you to be more real than all the others
I wanted our love to be more real than all of the rest
But it wasn't...
