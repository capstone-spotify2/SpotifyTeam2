You offer your assistance
But you won't accept my help
You draw your own conclusions
And there's room for little else

Your own participation's
Based on how much you can lose
I cannot help but feel
That this won't be of any use

Don't offer me your credit
Cuz I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favors
I don't wanna play that game

I do not want to see myself
As someone that you saved
I'd rather be your adversary
Than to be your slave

Cuz every friendly gesture
Turns my stomach inside out
Don't do me any favors
I am better off without

Don't offer me your credit
Cuz I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favors
I don't want to know your name

But it's alright
Yes it's alright
Yes its alright
Yes its alright
Yes it's alright

Don't offer me your credit
Cuz I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favors
I don't want to know your name

Don't do me any favors
Don't do me any favors
Don't do me any favors

Coz it's alright
Yes, it's alright etc

Ooh-don't give me any credit
Cuz I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favours
I don't want to see your face

But it's alright
Yes it's alright
