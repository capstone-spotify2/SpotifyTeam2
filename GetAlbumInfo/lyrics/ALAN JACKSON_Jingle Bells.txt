Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way; 
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight 

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side; 
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot; 
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upset 

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

In a one-horse open sleigh...
