Dear lord
I understand all the problems that I'm about to express to you
Are things you already know
Well here goes nothing.

Dear lord I am on my knees
And I'm begging please
Just guide me father, this a time I am really in need
Feeling like I just can't go on, mama crying and she lost her home
Tears runnin all down her face, judge gave her ten days to be gone.
My God what I'm gone do now, so stressed that the day go by.
Devil on me and I don't know why, beg mama just please don't cry.
Times get a lil rough I know, when it come to giving up I don't.
Got twins and they on they way, see them stars wanna bet I won't.
Sometimes I ask myself would I be a good father,
Cause I never had mine but I'd give the world to my daughters.
Live and you learn, reap what you sew
Regardless of wealth, grind like your poor.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Only lord knows what the hell I done really been thru,
All the nights I ain't have no food,
Dear God tell me what I'm a do.
Man only lord knows,
All them times I was all on my grind,
Need help But I never could find.
Reach out but I couldn't get a dime.
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows
Man only lord knows, what the hell I done really been thru,
All them nights my mama couldn't move,
And all the pain I don't put her thru.

And I'm sick and tired of this pain, hate the lames in this game.
Only down because of my name, watchs wish because of my fame.
Lords know that world that I came, lord knows the nights that I cried,
Can't help the pain that's inside, lord wipe the tears from my eyes.
Ever seen the letter of eviction, no place to go but you wishin.
That a blessing come and you lifted, yeah dawg that's all in my vision.
I done been thru hell in them trenches, I done seen the best of them fold,
Lost a couple of my dawgs,
Miss them niggas like shit.
But they still reside
In my heart,
Soul ached and I'm scarred,
I'm a do it for Dale and four fifth, God damn it's hard.
Mothafuck this rappin, I really live this shit.
Blood sweat and tears, I really give a shit.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Only lord knows what the hell I done really been thru,
All the nights I ain't have no food,
Dear God tell me what I'm a do.
Man only lord knows,
All them times I was all on my grind,
Need help But I never could find.
Reach out but I couldn't get a dime.
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows
Man only lord knows, what the hell I done really been thru,
All them nights my mama couldn't move,
And all the pain I done put her thru.

Chyeah and everyday I'm awake I grind, no time never wait for mine.
Still waitin on the day I shine, my soul every bar every line.
I remember when I had no food, lights off bills overdue.
Lord knows that I've paid my dues, don't forget when I got that news.
They say my mama sickly, thank God she seen her fifties.
I pray and ask forgiveness, please lord just keep her with me.
I was down and out, remember that like yesterday.
Made it out that struggle bracket, this here I'm blessed to say.
Man this worlds so fucked up, gas prices are way to high.
Times hard and I ain't gone lie, bust asses to try and get by.
So who the hell is y'all to be jugdin, made a way from literally nothing.
Yeah I'm talking literally nothing!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Only lord knows what the hell I done really been thru,
All the nights I ain't have no food,
Dear God tell me what I'm a do.
Man only lord knows,
All them times I was all on my grind,
Need help But I never could find.
Reach out but I couldn't get a dime.
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows
Man only lord knows, what the hell I done really been thru,
All them nights my mama couldn't move,
And all the pain I done put her thru.
Man only lord knows

I thank you Jesus for guiding me, for keepin me
In your name I pray, amen.

Man only lords knows.
