Body Bag! "Fire bro, that's gon' be the... that's gonna be the fire starter right there. Grind! (Grind) I'm grind'n (I'm grind', I'm grind', I'm grind')

They used to tell me I never would be, swear
They used to tell me I never would be shit
I never bought what they sellin' on that ship
I'm motivated from struggle, I gave my life to the hustle
And ain't no time to go cuddle with no bitch
A couple thousand a day shit just tryna get it
Remember Mama was cryin' I can't forget it
Just know my Daddy a coward
I still remember them seconds
I still remember them minutes down to the hours
That you was never around I had to hold that shit down
The only thing to do now, is go and get it
I put the word in the town, they know I carry the crown
I got them haters but round a nigga quick
Fuck it no I'm on a mission my system filtered with ambition
I'm like a gun that can hold a thousand of ammunition
My intuition to turn a track into demolition
I'm still the illest, it's God's willin', I'm Godzilla
Say I'm grind'n, I'm grind'n I'm grind'n
Fuck all this jewelry and that new designer, just show me the dollars
Osama bin Laden
I am in search for them millions and millions of dollars
Like Osama bin Laden
Tell 'em don't call me if it ain't a talk 'bout the commas
Put that on my mama, Please tell them haters I did what I said
Been through the battle but I never fled
Message from haters, go jump off a ledge
Ain't no alliance, the real what I pledge
Nothing was givin' I grind for my livin'
They can keep sleepin', I'll sleep with ya' bitches
Bitch I'm from Broward and I won't allow it and I made decisions
You out ya' division

Tell em I'm grind'n for all of my shit
I'm a hustle for all of my shit
I put my life on the line, I'm dedicated to grind'n
In my eyes I'm dying for this shit
Yeah I'm grind'n for all of this shit
Yeah I'm grind'n for all of this shit
I put time in to all of this, I put time in to all of this shit

So tell my niggas I got em and they believe it
I see the future, I'm calling it how I see it
I brought the foreign vehicles to the hood
I give the hope to my city I am the meaning
Cause I've been hustling baby, know you missin' me lately
I been runnin' em crazy with the dick, just know it's fuck you pay me
Smokin' kush on the daily, all you niggas fugaze on my list
Know I'm doin' every single thing for my Mama
Stackin mad checks for my son and my daughter
Livin' on the edge, I'm just tryna get ahead
I'm just tryna get some head while I listen to The Carter
Know I've been a hustl'n dog since I was six
A real one with a story now let it mix
Now take a lil' bit of Pac and put it all in the pot
When you removin' the top this what you get

Cause nigga I been grind'n for all of my
I been grind'n for all of my
I put time in to all of this shit
I'm the realest to come to this shit
Cause I'm grind'n for all of my
Said I'm grind'n for all of my shit
Niggas is hatin' on what I do
Tell em pussies to suck on a nigga dick
Cause tell em I been grind'n for all of this shit
I've been grind'n for all of this shit
I'm a hustle for all of this shit
