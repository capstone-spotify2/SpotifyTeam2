I'm a man and I stand
For my life and my land
Backing off is not - not my way

I was taught and I thought
A man is cold as ice
Showing off is not allowed

With my gun on the run
The force to kill a man
Looking in his eyes - my god, why

Is it me, is it you
The one who has to die
Hold on my friend
Could this be our end

I am man enough to cry
Hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry

Giving up what I've got
For a man and his life
The only way - to survive

I'm a man and I stand
For my life and my land
Hold on my friend
Could this be our end

I am man enough to cry
Hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry

Oh, hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry
Hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry
Hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry
Hearts are burning
I am man enough to cry
