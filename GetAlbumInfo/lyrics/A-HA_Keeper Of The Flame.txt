Give it up for rock'n roll
Give it up for rock
Give it up for how it made you feel

Give it up for vinyl days
Kicking back from school
Turning out to make it real sweet

Give it up for rock'nroll
Give it up for bob
Give it up for how it made you see

Give it up for silvertone
Give it up for golden
Adolescent daydreams

Incidental incidents
Instrumental instruments
A plan evolves too grand to entertain

Monumental monuments
Sentimental sentiments
You could've been the keeper of the flame

Incidental incidents
Instrumental instruments
Swallowed by the place from which you came

Monumental monuments
Sentimental sentiments
You should've been the keeper of the flame

Give it up for summer days
Laying in the grass
Everything is happening in your head
You raise your fist up in the air
Clench your teeth and say
Four more years and I'm outa here

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Four more years and I am outa here!
