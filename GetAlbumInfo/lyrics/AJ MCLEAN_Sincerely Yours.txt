I burn the pages in my head
But the memories are so clear
A thousand words left unsaid
And you never shed a tear
You say that you wanna be close to me
So how does it feel?

Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
All about me
Where were you when I needed you?
The only thing that I learned from you
Was how to walk out the door
Sincerely yours

Now I'm a man
Out on my own
I am not ashamed
You broke my heart
You stole my pride
All you left me was my name
I know you wanna be in my shoes
So how does it feel?

Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
All about me
Where were you when I needed you?
The only thing that I learned from you
Was how to walk out the door
Sincerely yours

I just wanna forgive and forget all about you
Why can't I just move on?
From this place in between loving and hating you
Don't know where to belong

I burn the pages in my head
But the memories are so clear

Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
All about me
Where were you when I needed you?
The only thing that I learned from you
Was how to walk out the door

Sincerly yours
Sincerly yours
