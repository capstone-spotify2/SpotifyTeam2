This is how it ends, never meant to hurt you
I'm a pretty mess and I don't deserve you
I ran out of time and second chances
Sorry couldn't build your white picket fences

And I only got myself to blame

'Cause every time I see you, it's like all I am is see-through
We were everything I know it, don't wanna miss it, record it
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
The falling out was easy, but I hate that you don't need me
And it gets so hard to speak, every time you get to me
'Cause I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)

Everybody says that you're doin' fine now
Cruisin' for a thrill like I wouldn't find out
When you turn it back, do you ever wonder
If we could have tomorrow, in technicolor

And I got so much left to say

'Cause every time I see you, it's like all I am is see-through
We were everything I know it, don't wanna miss it, record it
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
The falling out was easy, but I hate that you don't need me
And it gets so hard to speak, every time you get to me
'Cause I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)

And no, can't you see it
I adore you
No, no, you're mine
(I adore you)

'Cause every time I see you, it's like all I am is see-through
We were everything I know it, don't wanna miss it, record it
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
The falling out was easy, but I hate that you don't need me
And it gets so hard to speak, every time you get to me
'Cause I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
I adore you
(I adore)
