We sit and watch umbrellas fly
I'm trying to keep my newspaper dry
I hear myself say,
"My boat's leaving now"
...so we shake hands and cry
Now I must wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

You know
I don't want to cry again
Don't want to cry again
I don't want to say goodbye
Don't wanna cry again
I don't wanna run away
I don't want to race this pain
I'll never see your face again

Oh but how 
How can you say
That I didn't try...
You see things in the depths of my eyes
That my love's run dry
No...

We leave to their goodbyes
I've come to depend on the look in 
their eyes
My blood's sweet for pain
The wind and the rain bring back 
words of a song 
And they say wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

You know
I don't want to fall again
I don't wanna know this pain
I don't want another friend
I don't wanna try again
Don't want to see you hurt
Don't let me see you hurt
I don't wanna cry again
I'll never see your face again

How can you say 
That I didn't try
You know I did
You see things
in the depths of my eyes
That my love's run dry
(I don't wanna cry again...)

...So I read to myself
A chance of a lifetime to see new horizons
