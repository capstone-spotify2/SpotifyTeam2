A bitter taste, a better view
All it takes is all of you
Some will say seventh son
Forget the future, let it go

There's a fire underneath
Give the time and they will see it
Believe it

Hey, we've been asleep too long
Hey, we've got a million miles to go
But we're a million strong
And this is, this is a moment
We have awoken
Hey, they say we don't belong
But we are, we are unbroken
We are unbroken

A higher cause, a heavy toll
Through all with lust along the road
With every step it changes you
And now we're left with no excuses
The truth is

Hey, we've been asleep too long
Hey, we've got a million miles to go
But we're a million strong
And this is, this is a moment
We have awoken
Hey, they say we don't belong
But we are, we are unbroken
We are unbroken

Before we'll run out of time
This city needs us tonight
We've got to bring it to life
Sweetheart, we are

Hey, we've been asleep too long
Hey, we've got a million miles to go
But we're a million strong
And this is, this is a moment
We have awoken
Hey, they say we don't belong
But we are, we are unbroken
We are unbroken
