<i>[Intro]</i>
Real niggas came to party (Ace Hood)
Real nggas came to party

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I say Lord have Mercy all I wanted was a beamer
Had no pot to piss in, n now I'm living thank you Jesus
Now my rolley flooded, n I'm not talkin bout Katrina
Know I roam the city, couple thousand for ma sneakers
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
Bring the kush, or Ciroc Its Goin Down
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
Bad bitches bring the whips Its Goin' Down

<i>[Ace Hood]</i>
Okay, Happy birthday nigga everyday I'm gettin cake
Whats the day? Its Tuesday, bitch I might blow a hunnin' K (YEAH)
Fuck that nigga they sleepin, must not have raised the stakes
Can't play with a nigga, no way drop as white as mayonaise
Holy shit betta watch yo bitch, frito lay gotta stack dem chips
Keep that tool on me oh shit, and i keep 2 clips my nigga don't trip
Boy you talk I get money, ridin' round in that new 600
With them young niggas on the block who run it, Evil kinevil boy we stunt
Millionaire nigga I got diamonds on my dick
Boy my swagger dope, I'm talkin 20 kilo bricks
Just bought me an aston, n it came with a spanish bitch
Diamonds got me froze like a PS3 glitch

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Meek Mill]</i>
Okay I'll go into ma beast mode, rapper niggas I eat those
Tell a bitch take a deep breath, then bend them knees like a freethrow
I don't want me no good girl, cause i fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom I make a movie, n it starring me with that Lee Rose
I ball hard like D Rose, my sash of closet
Racks all in my pocket, these racks all in deposit
I got racks all on my conscious, money all on my mind
I got shooters on my team, n they got bodies on ignite
Look at that bad bitch right there (right there), see that body on that dime
I ain't swimmin in no hoe, you know I'm prolly that my grind
All these niggas hatin' on me (me), but I ain't on that time
Cause I be in that back nigga, I ain't talkin bout fire (Woah)

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Ace Hood]</i>
Ahem, Now let's all say a prayer, since my swagger such a killer (Amen)
Might just buy a chicken, give her that dick fillet for dinner
Nigga don't want no problems, pistol prolly get you this figure
Lookin' at all my diamonds, it ain't hard to tell the winner
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
Its Goin' Down (Its Goin' Down)
That potato on the barrel no sound
You see them forin, you see we tourin
Me and Meek Milly realest niggas born (Pray)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
