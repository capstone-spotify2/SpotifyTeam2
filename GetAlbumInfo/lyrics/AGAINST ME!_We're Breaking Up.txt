This is the only voice I know.
These are the only words I have.
This is the only way I know how to say, we're not in love anymore.

It's the same way that it's always been, 
the dynamic to the relationship never changes.
It's the same way that it's always been, 
the dynamic to the relationship never changes.

We used to like all the same bands.
We used to have all the same friends.
What do we have left in common?
Just shared memories of good times long since past.

It's the same way that it's always been, 
the dynamic to the relationship never changes.
It's the same way that it's always been, 
the dynamic to the relationship never changes.
You can't get what you want from me, and I can't get what I need from you.

This is the only voice I know.
These are the only words I have.
This is the only way I know how to say, we're breaking up.

It's the same way that it's always been.
It's the same way that it's always been.
I'm not giving up on us.
I'm not giving up on us.
