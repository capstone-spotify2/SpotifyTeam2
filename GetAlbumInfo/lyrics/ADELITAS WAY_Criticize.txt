I need you, you need me
We make the perfect kind of misery
I help you and you help me
Become the one I swore I'd never be
The one that I don't ever want be

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you
Is hard to criticize

Suppress this, this hatred
I stand beside you while you soak it in
Spit on me I taste it
I love you more and you just fake it
I want you more and you just fake it

I like the way
You won't apologize
I like the way
You just demoralize
I like the way
You always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you
Is hard to criticize

There's always something wrong,
There's something I didn't do
There's always something I'm afraid I'm gonna lose
There's nothing I can say,
There's nothing I can do
No matter how hard I try I wake up next to you

I like the way
You won't apologize
I like the way
You just demoralize
I like the way
You always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you
Is hard to criticize

I like the way
You won't apologize
I like the way
You just demoralize
I like the way
You always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you
Is hard to criticize

It's hard to criticize <i>[x4]</i>
