Jesus is waiting
And if you're broken down
Jesus is waiting, hey yea
Don't let yourself down

Oh He standing right there behind you

Helping you to make up your mind

Do I have to say it again (say it again)
Jesus is waiting, Hey

Talking bout, you've got a friend
I believe it this evening
I just want you to know

Reach down in your heart and say
A little prayer just for me
He's the One that believes in love
Can't you see

Hey - Thank you
Hey - Thank you

Jesus is waiting, Jesus is waiting
What I want you to do is just
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me

Help me, I'll help you,
Jesus, save my soul
I'll live for You
I'll do my best to just
Do what I can to
Stand up and be a man
I said Hey...

I just want everybody to know that
Jesus is waiting, Hey
Jesus is waiting

I wish the band would just <i>[4x]</i>
Bring way down
I said I've been a fool
Disregarding Your love
Hey Father, I just want to tell You
That, I'm Sorry, (Sorry) Sorry, (Sorry)
Sorry (Sorry) Sorry Hey...

You've been good to me
You've been good to me
You've been good to me
