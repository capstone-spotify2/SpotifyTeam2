What is love if you don't have it
It ain't enough when you have it
Things get rough when it's a habit, what is love...
What is love if you can break it
What is love if you can't make it
Falls apart when you forsake it, what is love...

What is love, what is love,
If it takes so long to find
If it makes you lose your mind <i>[x2]</i>
What is love... Ha!
What is love...

What is gain without the giving
I go insane without you, living
Is a shame if you can't forgive me, then what is love...
What is love if you can break it
What is love if you can't, make it
Falls apart if you forsake it, what is love...

What is love, what is love, if it takes so long to find
An' if it makes you lose your mind  what is love...
What is love, what is love, love's a heart that never lies
When it opens your eyes...then it's love...

You cannot feed the hand that bites you, no, no,
If you bite the hand that feeds you baby
I'm the woman who needs you, take my hand, be my man...
Don't ask me stupid questions, I don't wanna hear you mention,

What is love, what is love, if it takes so long
If it makes you lose your mind then what is love...
Oh, what is love, what is love, love is a heart that never lies
When it opens your eyes...
What is love, love, love, if it takes long to find
An' if it makes you lose your mind  what is love...oh
What is love, love, love, it's a heart that never lies
When it opens your eyes
What is love!
