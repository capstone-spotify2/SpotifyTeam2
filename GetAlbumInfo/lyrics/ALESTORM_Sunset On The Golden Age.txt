Inside of aeons from chaotic spires
A shell of frozen time
Where beats the silent ocean
Of shadows turned sublime
Forces of inspiring luminescence
Guide the hidden way
I know that it will take me to
Another golden age
Sundered from daylight, by the rage of the unseen
Betwixt carbonic plateaus where rarity convenes
Under the heat of a thousand suns destruction is attained
When flows the red and ochre histories ingrained
Legends pass and time ticks on, entropy prevails
Into the endless darkness every ship must sail
Ouroboros uncoiled, the circle ends tonight
One thousand years of history banished from all sight
The sun will set forever
Never to rise again
And in the coming darkness
We'll fight to the bitter end
Our legend passed from memory
It's time to turn the page
The sun has set upon the golden age
The final chapter, the end is close at hand
Across the boundary where ocean meets the sand
Embrace the anatine, forsake all that you know
The tenebrous cosmic sphere where all of us must go
Inside of aeons from chaotic spires
A shell of frozen time
Where beats the silent ocean
Of shadows turned sublime
Forces of inspiring luminescence
Guide the hidden way
I know that it will take me to
Another golden age
The sun will set forever
Never to rise again
And in the coming darkness
We'll fight to the bitter end
Our legend passed from memory
It's time to turn the page
The sun has set, now night is falling
Never again to hear the calling
The sun has set upon the golden age
