I need your, need your heart
Oh
I need your heart
Oh
I need your, need your heart
Oh
I need your heart
Oh
I need your, need your heart
I need your
Oh
I need your heart
I need your
Oh
I need your, need your
You think, that I need you
But I say, that I need your, need your
Arms around, because I'm all alone
So take me away
Don't need to feel this pain
So take me away
So take me away
So take me away
I need your
Oh
I need your heart
I need your
Oh
I need your, need your heart
heart
heart
heart
So take me away
So take me away
You think that I need you
But I say that I need your
Need your arms around
Because I'm all alone
So take me away
