Hey lady, yes I've been watching you with your sweet and
Sexy ways I know you're checking me too and I noticed that
Certain look in your eyes, says to me boy jump right on it don't let
This pass you by

Well I know what I like and I like what I see ooh you keep a
Fire burnin' inside of me, it's a feeling I get when I'm lost in
Your eyes finally ooh I realized

I like it can't fight it this feeling's a fact ooh you drive me
Crazy and I like it like that, I like it can't fight it and that's
Where I'm at ooh you keep me comin' and I like it like that

Call me crazy why I'm so into you, cause you play me like you

Don't when I know that you do. While you're playin' girl just
Keep working my mind, don't give in too easy we've got plenty of time

Well I know what I like and I like what I see girl I'm crazy
Bout ya and I'm willing to please it's a feeling I get when I'm
Lost in your eyes finally ooh I realized

<i>[chorus]</i>

I like what you do to me, the feeling you give to me the way
You move me no one else, and nothing compares to you

The way that you do, the things you do to me there's no one
Like you, as far as I can see all you got to do is call on me
