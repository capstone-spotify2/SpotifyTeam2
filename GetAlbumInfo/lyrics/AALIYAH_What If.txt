What if.. every guy I saw
What if.. sitting down at the bar
What if.. I told him to give me a call
What if.. what if, what if, what if
What if.. every guy in the place
What if.. was all up in my face
What if.. what would you say
What if.. what if, what if, what if

I hate a jealous man, one who doesn't understand
That I'm attractive so of course men wanna take my hand
And lead me off round the corner maybe to their place
But when they speak you get mad, jumping all up in my face

But on the other hand when women come and speak to you
You kiss and hug them like it's something that you let me do
You're only jealous cause you know the ish you put me through
I might turn right around and do that ish right back to you

I hate a lying dude, one who doesn't know the rules
If you gonna cheat burn the receipt from the hotel room
But instead you're up in my face saying you were at friends
But they all call asking me where the hell you been

Why they keep treating us this way
I guess it's a little game we play
We'll burn you (oh), we'll cut you (oh)
We'll kill you (oh)
We don't have to take it no more
