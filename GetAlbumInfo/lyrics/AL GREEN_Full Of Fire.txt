I'm full of fire
You're my one desire
Babe, I'm full of fire
You can make me cry

I can dance to the music
I can sing all night long
I can play with the band
Until you hear my song

Cause I'm full of fire
To see the party light
Hey, I'm full of fire
Think they're red and white

I can dance with the fire
Burnin', burnin' love
I can stay 'til the party is all over

Hey, I'm full of fire
And I'm over twenty one
Hey, I'm full of fire
And my life has just begun

I can dance to the music
Girl, I can understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand

Dance, dance, dance
I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand.

I can dance
Dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Understand, understand, understand
There's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey, hey, I can dance
Dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Understand, understand, understand
There's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, I can dance
Let me say I can dance
Full of fire, my heart's desire
