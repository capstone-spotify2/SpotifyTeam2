This ain't a song that I should write for you
Lately I'm just into verse
As dedicated as something new
And I know where is the heart in this
You left this taste on my tongue
If that's all that takes my sense
I'd catch it on a breeze and fill my lungs

And
Where is the heart in this
I don't know, I don't know
Where is the heart in this
I don't know, I don't know

This isn't something I wanna sing about
Don't wanna give away too much
It's been so long since I last fall out
And you know I think about you constantly and I just want my soul to shout
Perhaps I should collect my things and kick myself out

And
Where is the heart in this
I don't know, I don't know

Where is the heart in this
I don't know, I don't know

No this is not the song
These are not the words that I thought I would write down for you
But I feel like I have to
I guess you still got me asking
I know you still got me asking

Where is the heart in this?
I don't know, I don't know

Where is the heart in this?
I don't know, I don't know

I don't know...
