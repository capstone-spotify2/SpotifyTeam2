For those who fancy colouring books
And lots of people do
Here's a new one for you
A most unusual colouring book 
The kind you never see
Crayons ready
Very well
Begin to colour me

These are the eyes
That watched him
As he walked away 
Colour them grey 
This is the heart
That thought
He would always be true
Colour it blue

These are the arms that held him
And loved him
Then lost him somehow
Oh... 
Colour them empty now

These are the beads
I wore until she came between
Colour them green

This is the room that I sleep in
And walk in, and weep in, and hide in
That nobody sees 
Oh... 
Colour it lonely please

This is the man
Whose love I depended upon
Colour him gone
