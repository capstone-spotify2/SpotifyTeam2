Something isn't right
I don't know how I know
But baby, it's despite
Your dog-and-pony show

I can hear it coming
You're only going through the motions, baby
With your engines humming
You're just going through the motions, baby

Feel like I'm in jail
With you and Mr. Hyde
A guy who leaves a trail
About a mile wide

So it starts already
That you're just going through the motions, baby
You can throw confetti
But you're still going through the motions, baby
Going through the motions, baby

They'll have a big parade
For every day that you stay clean
But when the trumpets fade
You'll go under like a submarine
And you won't see it coming
No, you won't see it coming

You could have it made
Up there in San Rafael
But baby, I'm afraid
I'll never see you well

Because I've seen the tally
And you're just going through the motions, baby
To a big finale
That comes from going through the motions, baby
Going through the motions, baby
Going through the motions, baby
You're just going through the motions, baby
