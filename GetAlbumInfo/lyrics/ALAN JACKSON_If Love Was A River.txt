If love was a river
And I was a drowning man
Would you get in the water
Would you lend me a hand
If love was a river
Would you sit on the land

If love was a mountain
High above this town
Would you climb to the top
Would you never look down
If love was a mountain
Would you go around

Love rarely knocks so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a firefly
Sitting in your hand
Would you laugh when it twinkled
Let it go again
If love was a firefly
Would you understand

If love was a party
With everyone you know
Would you dance if I asked you
Would you smile and say no
If love was a party
Would you even go

Love rarely knocks so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore

If love was a fast train on a one-way track
Would you turn in your ticket
Would you never look back
If love was a fast train
Would you even pack?
