<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Yo, check â my flow is unknown to man yet
Damnit â keep runninâ âround like an annual banquet
Made a withdrawal with your broad, she left the bank wet
Rub her like a condom, contemplating dangerous sex
Iâm unimpressed with your talent, skills still appeal
A maestro on the mic, though, Iâm almost as ill as Camille, for real
Ainât never runninâ from nothinâ, Iâm fit to tread mills
Name another movement making time stand stillâ¦
High-powered to the third degree
Murder, we emerged, and it was an emergency
Itâs closed curtains for you worthless earthlings
Hurtinâ âcause I rise like mercury in the burning heat
Words on the streets, Solo done done it again
Look at me, I used to match a dub sack with my friends
Now we smokinâ by the O, like the letters P and N
Ainât have to start watching CNN for you to see an end
Itâs coming quicker than you think, donât mean to rub it in
Like Lubriderm, but you should learn that you could never fuck with him
Abs gettinâ bigger, but I ainât do no sit-ups
Got the hiccups, âcause I keep puffinâ âPorts without the filter
Feel the vibe switch in every single room that I enter
Told my bitch to make room for a tomb for her placenta, nigga
Iâll fuck her âtil she have a seizure in my leisure time
She know I love her, also know I donât need her
âCause Iâm a king, and I smoke a lot of weed
That makes sense, itâs about 33 ounces in a litre
In laymanâs terms, you lames had better pay respect
Or youâll be sleepinâ, theyâll be at your wake, payinâ their respects

<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i>
Said itâs the soul cold wickedness â old folk killinâ shit
Most Dope syndicate, the Go Proâs filming it
Good coke, sniffinâ shit â broke, no benefits
Smack him in his face and then Iâm blowinâ smoke into it
Obliterated on a big estate, shitâ¦
I figure fame is just a bitchâs game
Thatâs why thereâs raindrops drippinâ off my windowpane
And I was gettinâ money far before the fiscal game
Official names, got plugs like a new strain does
You may be hot inside your city, but homie you ainât us
You canât trust nothinâ if itâs cominâ with a dollar sign
Itâs genius coming from out of my awkward mind
Cross the line? Itâs just not the time
And he ainât thinkinâ, put that red dot on his mind
Iâm Satanaâs bandana, against me, you donât stand a chance
Call you fancy pants, âcause when you drunk, you do the hammer dance
If thereâs a random chance you fuckinâ up my Phantom plans
Iâmma go bananas and blam âem until the ambulance
My motherâs sonogram was like a mission statement
âCause I wasnât patient, left that pussy in a spaceship
Yâall fools basic, your parents both racist
Iâm lawyering these hoes out here, beating cases
She eatinâ dick, so she plead the Fifth
Yeah, itâs Larry Fish, homie, heâs a myth
You sunk my battleship, I be in Nazareth âbout where Jesus lived
And your homie with you, heâs a bitch, some vagina shit
Gettinâ faded, go sing in Vegas
Iâm just observing, a man of different faces
Yup, some dick licker want my kids in her
She a switch hitter, told her bring a bitch with her
The dick split her like a Swisher then Iâm outtieâ¦ outtie
I never eat the pussy if itâs lousyâ¦ lousy
Iâm the prodigal son, the ominous Nostradamus
Anonymous visions, confidant, some Obama shit
In moccasins, takinâ Annieâ¦ alrightâ¦
