<i>[Intro - Ab-Soul &amp; Da$H:]</i>
Have some fun out there
Smells like fucking dope in here
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you

<i>[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments
Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion
More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more
(smoke that weed nigga)
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp, burn that (roll that weed nigga)
We used to dub cassettes but now we poppin' Percocets
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields
Wicked as Aleister Crowley do you niggas know the deal?
(Son, do the drugs don't let the drugs do you)
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms!
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
I flow like, Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind"
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs and I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed nigga)
Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass up)
I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us
They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest
That ever so, talented establishment
TDE. Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me... Soul
(What up Zay? What Up SZA?)

<i>[Hook:]</i>
When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches These Days
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days!
Just Have Some Fun (got that Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Some Fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Fun

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I just wanna teach you all about the mind
The power in it, the very power of mine
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice
That's why I read a lot of books, so I got straight A's
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in
(Met the devil in God's elbow)
And this is what he said...

<i>[Skit:]</i>
Hi, my name is Jimmy
(Hi Jimmy)
I'm a friend of a rapper
You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
I like Denim Jeans
And I'm an alcoholic...
