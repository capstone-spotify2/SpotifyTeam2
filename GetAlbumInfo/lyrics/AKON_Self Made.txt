Self made
Anthem on my life for the marching band

Bomb like the taliban
Popping like a frying pan
Slide like a violin
Through the crackhole blindfold like a telescan

All the real niggas glad he made it
Gladiator babe
Don't be acting shady babe
Seeing niggas shining through the diamonds tryna see me babe

Fucking with the hottest so the hottest I deserved the ball

I'd did what I had to
Grind on my own too
Feed from the street with the killas and the real goons
Watching out for popo
Tryna sell the yayo tryna be the weed man
Even sell the beans man
I'm a always stand out I don't take no handouts
But I take you're money bruh
Butt up in you're grandma
I hustle till I die
With the rapping with the trapping
Whether be a hit man with the guns clapping
Coming straight from the hood
I'm a make it happen
I ain't never had shit I had to sell or snatch it
Chrome cree fifty seven got always packed in
That I cut you're fucking head like a fucking hatchet

<i>[Project Pat:]</i>
Film made
Getting paid wouldn't find my own puge
Chill like Frank Lucas did wouldn't get my own jew'ls
Taped up by my nugs on the plane cali buds
Soon as I hit the hood I ain't showing cali love
Everything for the streets nigga gotta give me me
Five hundred dollars ounce of purp
In these memphis street
Had to made a kille ya off a drug dealy ya
Wrap up bout my life and I saw me a millie ya
Mr gold plate get raw than we pop ya
DB investments Cocaine mafia
Pistols and shotguns grams and the hard run
Twenty eigths on the dough got these hummers so much
