He wants to hold the children up high
When they come tearing through the rye
To save them from falling
To save them from falling

He wants to bring a little honey
To the saltiness of grief
To come up from underneath
You used to say that you would rescue me
But you yourself are lost at sea

Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together

Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together

Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together
