They trying to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
Itâs funny âcause they probably did

Fuck Iâm doing talking âbout pineal glands
Fuck Iâm doing talking âbout pineal glands
Ancient ways of Sumerians
Ainât nothing wrong with a righteous man
Uh, this is my Anunnaki flow
Oh, this be my Anunnaki flow
Yo, I got that Anunnaki flow
You are now on Planet X, Iâm the God, show your respect
HiiiPower

Iâm the destroyer, and this is doomsday
360,000 years since I made way
Hey, I hate to be the one to warn ya
Your government knew all along
Guess they wasnât tryna spoil it for ya
Boy oh boy, Iâm hot to death, high as my magnetic field
Theologists preach of me but they donât think Iâm really real
All my angels up in here, all my demons up in here
I know who brought you in this world
They will take you out of here
The law of relativityâs cute, I even sunk Atlantis too
NASA on some bullshit, they always cropping out my crew
(Yep) and they be loving the crew
(Yep) yea they be loving the crew
I know that you heard about me, bout me way way back in school
Mayan calendars, you went to church, we all know Revelations
You see Porsches
Behold of pale horses galloping âcross the nation
Watch out for them Seven Seals, Iâll be in the sky
The Euphrates Riverâs dry so you know itâs real

No man knoweth the hour of my return
Itâll be like a thief in the night, make sure your people's alright
Thatâs right, the writing's on the wall
They was only worried about Sodom âcause they ainât have the balls to go against the gods
The only brown dwarf swagginâ
Cross yo sun just like a dragon
The Japanese know whatâs happening
They was debating âbout Kobe and LeBron
The Bible or the Qurâan, they shouldâve been taking cover
They said Iâm red but gold is my favorite color
Witnesses agreed, they see me with wings when I hover
Might even make your pole shift when Iâm skipping through
My orbit is a bitch on her menstrual
They underminded the prophecy of Daniel
Thatâs a bummer, now Iâm at your doorstep but not for sugar
This that anunnaki flow, Enki and Enlil would love it
Serious as the war in Syria, bitch <i>[?]</i>

Global warming's a lie, the moon is a satellite
Holographic universe we enter to the light

"Back in the 1950's - most people weren't aware of it - but there was a scientific storm in America all through the late '50's -
about this thing out there in space - it's because the astronomers were all watching it,
and that was back when they weren't afraid to talk about it..."

Ayo, just in case I get killed for this shit
You got your heads up
Make sure you tell 'em JMSN ain't have nothing to do with this shit
God bless y'all
Killuminati...all through my body
Blows like a 12-gauge shotty

I told Punch Iâd probably get assassinated by the government
He probably think Iâm sniffin' cocaine and some other shit
