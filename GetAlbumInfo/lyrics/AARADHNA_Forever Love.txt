Itâs a shame 
That you canât love me much as I do
Ooh
Was a shame
That you canât love me much as I do
Love you
Even though you oh
Love you forever
This is forever
Even though you oh
Love you forever
This is forever
This forever love
This forever love
This forever love
I sure do love you

When I leave this world behind
I will be dying a fool
Not even that can stop my love 
From chasing you 
And this does hurt like hell
To know you donât feel the same
Ooh

Even though you oh
Love you forever
This is forever
Even though you oh
Love you forever
This is forever
This forever love
This forever love
This forever love
I sure do love you

When the sun drop
When the clouds stops
At the end
I still be loving you
When the dark fall
When the moonâs gone
In the end
I still be loving you
This forever love
This forever love
This forever love
I sure do love you
