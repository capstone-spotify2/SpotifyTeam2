When I see a pretty woman
You know it gives me a thrill
And she's a tailor made to order
You know I can't stand still
And you won't need a doctor
'Cause it'll cure all ills

And when I hear a noisy party
You know it gives me a chill
It gets me rockin' and a rollin'
And I can't stand still
From morning 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still, oh yeah

When it comes to sippin' honey
You know I drink my fill
And I'll be dancin' on the water
You know I can't stand still
From morning 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
From morning 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
Baby I can't stand still
I just can't stand still
From morning 'till midnight
You know I can't
You know I can't stand still

Thank you lads, thank you lads, thank you
