Oh...
Take a walk in the warm New England sun 
Ain't no time to look for clues 
You get the point from Uncle Sam's loaded gun 
Who be the hand that light the fuse 

A take a look, take a look at my old billy goat 
He used to raise all kinds of hell 
He took a dose of radiation dope 
A back in the barn is where he felt, like hell 

Aar...Lucy, chromosome 
Lucy, superdome 

What makes you think you patronizin' my old friends 
After you ride in my car, car 
What do you do when your oil's Mexican 
OPEC boys, you went too far, too far 

Aar...Lucy, superdome
Lucy, chromosome 
Aar...Lucy, papadum 
Lucy, sing the song 

(Ah), dig it up 
(Ah), live it up 
(Ah), a dig it up 
(Ah), live it up 

Look out!
