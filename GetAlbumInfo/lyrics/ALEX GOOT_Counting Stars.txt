Lately I've been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

And I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately I've been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars yeah

I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately I've been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars whoa

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately I've been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
