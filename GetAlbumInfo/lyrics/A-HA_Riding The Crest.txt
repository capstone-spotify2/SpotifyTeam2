You search your mind
Thatâs what itâs there for
Check all the whysâ
And all the whereforesâ
In your mind
Youâre tall and brave
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave

You make your movements known
And where you want to be
And everybody knows
Thatâs how itâs got to be
In the sheltered morning sun
In the sheltered morning sun

Internally
You make your own rules
Youâll have excuses
The ones that you choose
In the end
You deem unsafe;
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave

You make your movements known...

There comes a time
You donât even know whatâs missing
Some sugar to make the pill go down
You need a line
A push in the right direction
The sugar that makes the pill go down

True
True to form
True to pre-existing norms
Truly wasted
At a rave
Riding the crest
Of a high and beautiful wave
