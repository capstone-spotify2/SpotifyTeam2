The fever's running in the city
People want to make it so much worse.
On the high street I can see no pity
People with their faces in the dirt.

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light.

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light,
Make it right.

See the man there kicking in the shadows
Why's he feel he's got to kill and steal?
He can't wait to see which way the wind blows
Does it mean he'll get a better deal?

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light.

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light,
Make it right, make it right.

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light.

Just one heart, that needs to open
Just one word will break the ice
One touch, to kill the darkness
One kiss to give it light.

Just one heart...one heart
Just one heart...one heart
Just one heart...one heart....
