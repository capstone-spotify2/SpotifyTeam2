Words are lost
Mouths are closed
Even through the silent pause
You take it all

Table talks 
Getting through the car ride home
It could be a late night call
You take it all

Anchor to hold

You leave me room for my imperfections 
When I'm a mess and you jump right in
If I drift in the wrong direction
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me

Faint applause, empty rooms
Even when the crowds are gone
You take it all

Lines are crossed 
Even when my mind's consumed
I never mean to bruise your heart
But you take it all

Anchor to hold

You leave me room for my imperfections 
When I'm a mess and you jump right in
If I drift in the wrong direction
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me

You leave me room for my imperfections 
When I'm a mess and you jump right in
If I drift in the wrong direction
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
You will find me
