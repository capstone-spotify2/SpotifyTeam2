Pretty Paper is playing on the jukebox 
And mistletoe is hanging above the bar
I want to thank you for this
Broken heart that I got
Merry Christmas Girl
Wherever in the world you are.

It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve.

Blue Christmas turn it up I wanna hear it
So I can unwrap all them Mem'ries in my mind
Hey Joe!! pour me some Christmas spirit
If I make it through December I'll be fine.

It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve.

Yeah, I'll be over you by
New Years Eve...
