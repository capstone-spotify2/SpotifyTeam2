Sweet breeze, blowin' through a summer dress
Seen from a window above
Captured in the eyes of love

Shivers, in the cool forbidden dawn
Where the Iris and Jasmin run wild
She was young and he was a child

He vanished like July
Some folks, they wondered why
But old money has its friends
Ain't it funny how the truth will bend

It's the family secret, don't pass it on
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong
It's the family secret of her mystery...

Whispers, how they sound like raindrops
Hush now we'll make it alright
She's framed by the front porch light
Uuuhuh, suspicion, raising up like dragonflies
They say there's a story to tell
Buried in the family well

Now the congregation prays
Save us from our evil ways
But old money has its friends
Ain't it funny how the truth will bend

It's the family secret, it's the family secret, don't pass it on
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong
It's the family secret, just let it be
I know the secret of her mystery...

It's the family secret, it's the family secret
It's the family secret, don't pass it on
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong
It's the family secret, just let it be
I know the secret to her mystery

Keep it in the family now, behind closed doors
Past the rows of cypress trees, through the Spanish moss
Those old stone walls
It's the family secret, it's the family secret
