You work together for our good
You are loving
You give us more than we deserve
You are unfailing
And we are more than conquerors
Savior
In you our future is secure
By your power

We will not be shaken
We will not be silent
Sin is powerless
Our God is for us

We will not be broken
He won't be defeated
Death is powerless
Our God is for us

Consider all that He has done
Our sin he carried
By His wounds we've overcome
Now we stand redeemed

And we are more than conquerors
Savior
In you our future is secure
By your power

We will not be shaken
We will not be silent
Sin is powerless
Our God is for us
We will not be broken
He won't be defeated
Death is powerless
Our God is for us

We will sing
Sing out
Sing for the hope
Found in His love
We will sing
Sing out
Sing to our God

We will sing
Sing out
Sing for the hope
Found in His love
We will sing
Sing out
Sing to our God

We will not be shaken
We will not be silent
Sin is powerless
Our God is for us
We will not be broken
He won't be defeated
Death is powerless
Our God is for us

We will not be shaken
We will not be silent
Sin is powerless
Our God is for us
We will not be broken
He won't be defeated
Death is powerless
Our God is for us
