I came home
To an empty house
Surrendered my thoughts
And then I passed out
As the world
Spinning round
She looked pale
As she lifted off the ground
And she said to me
Don't go
Don't go
And she said to me
Don't go
Don't go
I stood there
With my jaw on the ground
Lost my composure
But I didn't make a sound
Oh it's strange
How we disappear
One day
We're just no longer here
As she said to me
Don't go
Don't go
And she said to me
Don't go
Don't go
And she said to me
