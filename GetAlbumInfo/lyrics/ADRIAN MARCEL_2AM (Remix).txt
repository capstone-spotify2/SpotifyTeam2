You already know me, S-A-G-E

<i>[Sage The Gemini:]</i>
(Uhh, yeah)
Neck frozen, wrist too
Never seen a California igloo
My dude, on the magazine, for the issue
Your better off tryna' kick it, like jujitsu
Its 2am and I'm tryna' get in there
Say "X marks the spot"
But your ex not in here
My momma, I ain't for the drama
From the seb, no beef, we're just tryna' get the commas

I'm turnt up in this bitch
Drunk off that liquor
I can't trust these hoes
But you look so different girl
You... You got your girls, I got my niggas
So you... should tell yo girls to come fuck with us

Come live in the fast lane
Bottles every night, whatever you like
Coz I do things
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side
Coz a nigga wanna act strange
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you
And I ain't just running game
I ain't running game

Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
H-H-Hop on this girl
I know you're horny girl
I-I-I want it girl
I want it girl
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl

Let's pull off in this whip
Full speed to my after-hours
Take a couple more sips
Girl you know I'll be good for hours
You, you say it's real and I can feel on it - ah
You know the deal, we in the moment

Come live in the fast lane
Bottles every night, whatever you like
Coz I do things
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side
Coz a nigga wanna act strange
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you
And I ain't just running game
I ain't running game

Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
H-H-Hop on this girl
I know you're horny girl
I-I-I want it girl
I want it girl
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl

<i>[Problem:]</i>
Get your life changed while I make your spot rain
Think I'm Spike Lee the way I "Do the Right Thing" to it
Left and dipped to the set
Called your home girls and told em' what I did to the flap
Like "he killed it, he killed"
"Put his whole tongue in it I felt it"
On my momma, carve it up while I get behind ya
Now cook in front of me, Benihana's, promise
Reefer 100 I'm always smoking the prettiest dope
2AM better they're ain't a better place you can go
Back door like "Taylor Ford" I'm rolling like dice
Married to the money only get to throwing the rice
Grab a hold of the pipe, just play with it
Lean back while I-while I lay in it, hey!
So baby let's turn it up a notch
Hop in the diamond lane with the Chach (Chachi)
WHAAAT!

Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
H-H-Hop on this girl
I know you're horny girl
I-I-I want it girl
I want it girl
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
