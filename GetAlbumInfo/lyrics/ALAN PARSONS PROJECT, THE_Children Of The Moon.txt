Pay no attention to the writing on the wall
The words seem empty 'cause there's nothing there at all
We let the wise men beat the drums too soon
We were just children of the moon
None to turn to
Nowhere to run to even if we could

Too late  to save us but try to understand
The seas were empty there was hunger in the land
We let the blind man lead the way too long
Easy to see where we went wrong
Nothing to live for
Nothing to die for

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
We're lost in the middle of a hopeless world
Lost in the middle of a hopeless world
Children children of the moon watch the world go by
Children children of the moon are hiding from the sun and the sky
Children children of the moon watch it all go by
Children children of the moon are blinded by the light in their eyes

No one to turn to
Nowhere to run to even if we could

Follow the pilgrim to the Temple of the Dawn
The altar's empty and the sacrifice is gone
We let the madmen write the golden rules
We were no more than mortal fools
Nothing to live for
Nothing to die for

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
We're lost in the middle of a hopeless world
Lost in the middle of a hopeless world
Children children of the moon watch the world go by
Children children of the moon hiding from the sky
