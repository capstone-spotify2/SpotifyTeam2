I knew it would happen someday
But I never thought that it'd be tonight
Then you walked into the bar
With your new Mr.Right

With that big ol'chip on my shoulder
And Johnny Walker making me see red
I decided I'd walk right on over
And pour him a beer, on his head

<i>[Chorus]</i>
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care

I know it's not my proudest moment
But when he swung at my face and just missed
I decided there and then I'd introduce his chin
To my right fist

Then I tipped my hat to my ex-girlfriend
Said "Darlin' you should look nice
For a low down cheatin' dead beatin'
Cold hearted witch, ruin my life

<i>[Chorus]</i>
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care

Yeah I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Cause Mr. Right's finally coming up for air
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care

I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Instead of leavin' I sat back in my chair
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
