Rock Rock <i>[11x]</i>
I know you don't really want me to make it
I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it
I know you really don't wanna die
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You don't want anything to be your pain
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You got more to lose than you got to gain

I'm trying to understand the reason why you wanna hate Akon
Feel the beat, can't stop now
You trying to get in the way to make a nigga straight slow down
But you know we won't stop now
What about the crooked cops?
What about the liquor shops?
What about the things we do when it comes to holding down the block?
What about the fake ass hoes?
What about them with no clothes?
What about they'll do anything that you want them just show them the doe?
No matter where we go
There's no one above me
