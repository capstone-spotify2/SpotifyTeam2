I won't lie 
Sometimes it seems just too much to ask
For love to last I play the strong one holding on
Keeping it together 
The man with the plan
When I know better baby 
All I can do Is hold on to you
And keep workin' on it baby 
Get down and dirty 
Not afraid to sweat 
To have to earn it 
Workin' on it, baby 
Up all night 
Work on it baby
'Till we get it right 
Workin' on it baby 
I won't lie 
I have felt like walking out before
Closing the door 
But like the strong one holdin' on 
Keepin' it together 
The man with the plan
Girl we both know better
All I can do
Is run back to you and keep
Workin' on it baby 
Get down and dirty 
I'm not ashamed to say
That I'm still learnin'
Workin' on it, baby
Up all night
Work on it baby
'Till we get it right
I ain't proud
I ain't above it
You'll do anything for something
When you love it 
All I can do
Is hold on to you and keep 
Workin' on it baby 
Get down and dirty
Not afraid to sweat 
To have to earn it 
Workin' on it, baby 
Up all night 
Work on it baby
'Till we get it right
Workin' on it baby
Get down and dirty
I'm not ashamed to say
That I'm still learnin'
Workin' on it, baby 
Up all night
Work on it baby
'Till we get it right 
Workin' on it baby... workin' on it baby 
We'll be workin' on it baby...
workin' on it baby
We'll be workin' on it baby 
Workin' on it baby
We'll be workin' on it baby
Just keep workin' on it my love for you goes?
No baby, I don't think so
Has this prairie sky ever been so blue?
Have I ever been less afraid of the unknown? 
You know since I met you 
You've been my best friend
In that instant
I knew I was home
Some things you just know for sure 
It's like the faith of a child
You bring out the best in me 
And you bring out something wild
Is the sun gonna shine on a rainy night?
I don't think so
Does once in a lifetime happen twice?
I don't think so 
Could I love you any more
Could anything ever be more right?
Would life be worth livin' 
Without you here to hold?
No baby, I don't think so 
This love is physical
Unconditional
Oh it's spiritual
It's all wrapped up into one baby 
And as the universe unfolds
I wanna watch it all right here with you
Every day until my life is done
Is the sun gonna shine on a rainy night? 
I don't think so
Does once in a lifetime happen twice?
I don't think so
Could I want you any more
Could anything ever be more right?
Can words explain how deep my love for you goes?
No baby, I don't think so
