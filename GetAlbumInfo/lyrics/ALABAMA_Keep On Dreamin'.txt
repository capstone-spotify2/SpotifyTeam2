I am so happy with you in my arms
Honey don't you ever leave
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine
Keep on dreamin' with me.

Your hair is so soft and your eyes are so brown
Your body's warm here next to me
You be my woman and I'll be your man
And your love is all I'll ever need.

It took so long for me to find you
I've been lonely for so long, lonely
You came into me life to love me
Now my loneliness is gone.

You can't improve on perfection
And you are perfect for me
Cast your love in my direction
And I know that you will see.

I am so happy with you in my arms
Honey don't you ever leave
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine
Keep on dreamin' with me.

Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine
Keep on dreamin' with me.

Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine
Keep on dreamin' with me...
