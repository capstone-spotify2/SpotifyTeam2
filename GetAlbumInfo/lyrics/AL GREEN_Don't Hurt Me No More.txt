My heart beats the pain
Ohh, listen to me
My tears won't flood away, ohh, yeah

You look in my eyes, you will realize
I've been hurting, being mistreated
I'm a lonely fool, I've been cheated, baby, yeah

Don't hurt me no more now
Ooh, baby, baby, yeah, don't hurt me no more
Will you <i>[?]</i>

Ooh, never say goodbye
Do you know that I'm on my knees?
Girl, I'm cryin', need a lovin' hand
My heart is hurtin', baby, yeah

Don't hurt me no more
Ooh, yeah, baby, baby, don't hurt me no more now
I'm on bended knees, yeah, baby, baby, don't hurt me no more
