Gonna give âem that two four four on the floor
Like them outlaw boys done did before
Got the pretty girls out there beggin' for more
Gotta give âem all what they came here for
Doing my thing, singing my song, right on track I'm chuggin' along
I'm here and gone like yesterday rolling like an old freight train

On a wing and a prayer and a glorified Greyhound bus
Flying down the road running 9-0 and kicking up dust
Drinking truck stop coffee counting birds on those telephone wires
Burning the midnight oil and the tread off these ol' Goodyear tires

Gonna give âem that two four four on the floor
Like them outlaw boys done did before
Got the pretty girls out there beggin' for more
Gotta give âem all what they came here for
Doing my thing, singing my song, right on track I'm chuggin' along
I'm here and gone like yesterday rolling like an old freight train

And sometimes my mind is a million miles away
I know you're sound asleep at home while I'm on this stage
And I'm missing you wishing I was kissing you every day
But girl I gotta keep on rolling, rolling like an old freight train

And it's a mighty lonesome sound when there's not a soul around
To help you ease your pain
But you gotta keep rolling, rolling like an old freight train

Gonna give âem that two four four on the floor
Like them outlaw boys done did before
Got the pretty girls out there beggin' for more
Gotta give âem all what they came here for
Doing my thing, singing my song, right on track I'm chuggin' along
I'm here and gone like yesterday rolling like an old freight train

Comin' on down the line
Feel that diesel engine wind
Smell the smokestack
Hear the gears grind
Full steam ahead
Half way outta my mind
I'm too far gone to be turnin' back
Going clickety clack on the railroad track
I'm here and gone like yesterday rolling like an old freight train
Just like an ol' freight train
Tell me do you wanna ride this train
