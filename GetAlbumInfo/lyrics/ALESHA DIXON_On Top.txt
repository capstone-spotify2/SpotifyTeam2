Jeans a a t-shirt, that's what you prefer
Heineken kinda kinda guy, I do my research
But every time I see you, you're sipping grey goose
And I see that new Prada shirt, Mister GQ

Who you tryna impress, impress me
Ooh I love it, ooh I love it, so sexy
All dressed up, now undress me
Oh I look so good on ya
You thought I was hot before
Lights, camera press record
Wait til we, wait til we hit the floor
Ooh we so look good

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm your cherry on top, when I met you, you were hot
Now you're such a superstar
Boy I'm on the A-list, I'll make you famous.
I'm your cherry on top, make you wanna tie the knot
You know I can make you rock
Yeah I got the magic 'cause I'm the baddest

Lemme, lemme get on top

You like your cars loud, you like 'em worn out
You say you'd rather watch the game at your boys house
But when you come around me, I hop in your bugati
End up at the club, on the floor where you found me

Who you tryna impress, impress me
Ooh I love it, ooh I love it, so sexy
All dressed up, now undress me
Oh I look so good on ya
You thought I was hot before
Lights, camera press record
Wait til we, wait til we hit the floor
Ooh we so look good

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Lemme, lemme get on top

If you got the cake, I got the icing
Just hop in the plane baby, I'll do the flying
Push the throttle up, look at how much I scream
Throw me on the top, I'll make your life so exciting

<i>[Chorus]</i>
