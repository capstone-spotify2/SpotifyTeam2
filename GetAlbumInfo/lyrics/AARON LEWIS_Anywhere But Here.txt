This road is going nowhere
And these, these shoes are worn too thin
There's always should-haves where I'm going
There's always could-haves where I've been.

And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.

There's always footsteps from behind me
Why don't they ever read the writing on the wall
And all the time I've spent rewinding
It might mean nothing, it might mean nothing at all

And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.

The bed next to me is empty
Just like the, the shell I'm still trying to fill
The things put in life to tempt me
They won't ever, they might break my will

And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here. Wish I was anywhere but here.
