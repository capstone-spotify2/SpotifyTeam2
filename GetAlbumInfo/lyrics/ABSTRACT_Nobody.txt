They gon' try to hate on you just ignore everything they say
Don't listen to nobody
And never be afraid cause you don't know when it can be your day
Never listen to nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
Nobody, nobody, I didn't listen to nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
Nobody, nobody

Takin' trips cause I never tripped on what they said
If you speakin' from your heart, naysayers gon' aim for your head
Haters gon' mess with your vision, keep you up laying in bed
But know you gon' do this for you, cause you never did this for them
Sword was the mightiest pen, you lifted it right out of the stone
Destiny's choosing you cause the blade was made for you to own
Words cut deeper than any blade that a smith can mold
First person reference swung it reckless in my adolescence so I should know
Took the heat right out the air every breath was cold
But now I know, negativity toxic as dropkicks in a mosh-pit
Every day is Halloween skeletons in my closet
Monster under my bed they tryna get in my head
Till I wake up in the morning and forget what they said
So don't listen to nobody sometimes even yourself
Cause the darker parts of the mind aren't too eager to help
So just know

Such is life, such a vice, such a gift
Such is mine, such a movie, such a script, such a trip
I just flew overseas to meet the whole damn team
Would've never got to do this if you swayed my dreams
Craig and I been working since I hit 18
And Drumma and I made a couple hits you've seen
Blulake and I turned our lives to movie scenes
Crazy plan A turned into the whole A team, what that mean
Brought together by the power of music
To my vision and my fans I will stay the truest
They got me moving no label behind the movement
Day job to keep me grounded the sound is always improving
Small town kid used to dream too big
Hope I taught a small town you can't dream too big
What we got on the way our greatest project to date
We came together to make it, promise it's worth all the wait
So...
