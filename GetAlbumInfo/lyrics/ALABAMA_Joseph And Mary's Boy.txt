Out here is the country there's magic in the air.
It's the middle of December there's excitement eveywhere

Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned
The gift is just what's in your heart
And not what's in your hand

Who's the one we need to thanks
Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy

There were times we didn't think
We'd make it through the year
The bankers tried to take our farms
But somehow we're still here

I don't know how our crops survived
The drought and then the rain
It must have been a miracle
How else could you explain

And who's the one we need to thanks
And who's the party for
And who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
And who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy

The Christ Child born in Bethlehem
Joesph and Mary's boy

Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned
The gift is just what's in your heart
And not what's in your hand...
