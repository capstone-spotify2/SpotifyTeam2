Somewhere out there,
Past the rainbow,
Beyond the moon and the stars,
We found Love.

Now it's ours my Lady.
A gift to cherish.
Sent down from heaven above.
And I'm-I'm so thankful, baby.
That I've got you.
And I'm so glad- I don't know why,
I deserve you baby.
I won't question it.
I'll just have faith, oh.

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I believe,
That we'll never really figure out the mystery
That's behind all of the joy we're feelin'.
I can see, that some things are beyond understanding.
These are the secrets of Love.
Secrets of Love.

Like a feather falling,
from the blue sky.
It twists and turns as it passes us by.
Somehow it found us.
Now we can hold it
And make a wing if we try.
And we'll fly away baby.
No matter where the winds of fate will take us.

<i>[CHORUS X1]</i>

And we'll fly away baby.
No matter where the winds of fate will take us.

<i>[CHORUS X1]</i>
