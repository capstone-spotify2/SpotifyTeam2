By now in New York City.
There's snow on the ground.
And out in California.
The sunshines' falling down.
And maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights.
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight.

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines.
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight.

It's windy in Chicago.
The kids are out of school.
There's magic in Motown.
The city's on the move.
In Jackson, Mississippi to Charlotte, Caroline.
And all across the Nation, it's a peaceful Christmas time.

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines.
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight.
And from Fort Payne, Alabama.

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
God bless you all, We love ya,
Happy New Year, Good night, Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas tonight...
