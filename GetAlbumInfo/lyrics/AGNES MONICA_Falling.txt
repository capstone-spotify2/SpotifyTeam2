I've been on this road, so many days
A million vessels but I'm feeling alone
Swim see the lights, two distance storms
from go then last but than staying home

When I'm alone I think of you
And I keep falling, falling in you

Eventho it's raining I can keep on smiling
coz I know I'm falling into you
I don't know where we going
we just keep on moving
ohh.. I know I'm falling into you
Let's just get falling.. falling.. 
Yeaahhhh

I made you this no plan at all 
It took me a minute
Did you just give it my own
But you are there and I am here
If you ring it's the love and despair

When I'm alone I think of you
And I keep falling, falling in you

Eventho it's raining I can keep on smiling
coz I know I'm falling into you
I don't know where we going
we just keep on moving
ohh.. I know I'm falling into you
Let's just get falling.. falling.. 
Yeaahhhh 

I can keep you shining
You can keep me burning
When I saw the sunrise
Drifting out of your eyes
I just knew I was made for this

Eventho it's raining I can keep on smiling
coz I know I'm falling into you
I don't know where we going
we just keep on moving
ohh.. I know I'm falling into you
I can keep you shining
You can keep me burning yeaaahhh
When I saw the sunrise
Drifting out of your eyes
I just knew I was made for this 
so Let's just get falling.. falling.. 
Yeaahhhh yeaahh yeaahh
so Let's just get falling.. falling.. 
Yeaahhhh yeaahh yeaahh
Let's just get falling...
