Your ending was our beginning
Your last breath be came our first
Your suffering be came our healing
You were the way 
When no way could be found
You were the way 
When no way could be found

Every thing has been done
The cross is the proof we have won
For ever Your power over comes
Your life has defeated death
It is finished!

Our future out hope is found in
The promise weâre in your hands
Our rescue, youâve paid our ransom
You were the way 
When no way could be found
You were the way 
When no way could be found

Every thing has been done
The cross is the proof we have won
For ever Your power over comes
Your life has defeated death
It is finished!

All that you started, you have completed
All that you promised, you have fulfilled
All that you challenged, God you have conquered
As it is written; it is finished
All that you started, you have completed
All that you promised, you have fulfilled
All that you challenged, God you have conquered
As it is written; it is finished

Every thing has been done
The cross is the proof we have won
For ever Your power over comes
Your life has defeated death
It is finished!
