There's something movin' in the air tonight
Somthing movin' at the speed of light
And it's calling, calling, calling to you

I got a feeling running through my veins
We may never get this chance again
And it's calling, calling, calling to you
Yeah

Some can't understand
And they'll only go so far
It all depends on you
To fight for what you are

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

There's a feeling from inside your soul
There's a message in the rock and roll
And it's calling, calling, calling to you
Yeah

No easy going, no compromise
To know the rhythm's got me hypnotized
It was calling, calling, calling to you
Yeah

Some can't understand
And they'll only go so far
It all depends on you
To fight for what you are

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Oh, I'm calling out to you
Oh, I'm
I'm calling out to you...
I'm calling out to me

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're...
