Boy, you got me stranded 
Feeling for you 
And I don't know what to do about it 
'Cos you got me stranded 
Come on and help me through 
Boy, you got me stranded with you 

Such a beautiful mind 
Such a beautiful soul 
I've never met someone like you before 
And we could fly so high 

Painted pictures of you and me together 
Coming true in my mind 
And I feel, oh baby 
Deep down inside 
We could be magical 

Boy, you got me stranded 
Feeling for you 
And I don't know what to do about it 
'Cos you got me stranded 
Come on and help me through 
Boy, you got me stranded with you 

Now I've opened my heart 
I'm sharing secrets with you, oh 
I'm not afraid 
Baby, just take my hand 
And this time oh yea 

And lead us to a place where we can find eachother 
And trustin' peacefully 
And all I know is that I'm lost in your love 
That's one thing, one thing I know for sure 

Boy, you got me stranded 
Feeling for you 
And I don't know what to do about it 
'Cos you got me stranded 
Come on and help me through 
Boy, you got me stranded with you 

I never thought I'd fall so easily 
By simply lookin' in your eyes 
But boy you got me 
Boy, you got me stranded 
Wont you come and rescue me 
Wont you come and rescue me 

Boy, you got me stranded 
Feeling for you 
And I don't know what to do about it 
'Cos you got me stranded 
Come on and help me through 
Boy, you got me stranded with you
