Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground

Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

I die every time you walk away
Don't leave me alone with me
See, I'm afraid
Of the darkness
And my demons
And the voices
Saying nothing's gonna be OK

I feel it in my heart
Soul mind that I'm losing
You me
You're abusing every reason
I have left to live

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground

Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

Lost trust 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I ever owned gone
But I'm still breathing

Through the thunder
And the fire and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again

But I'm still breathing
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones
That I'm losing you me
You're confusing
Every reason I have left to live

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground

Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under

Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you, no
Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground

Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under under under

Only you can send me under, yeah, under
