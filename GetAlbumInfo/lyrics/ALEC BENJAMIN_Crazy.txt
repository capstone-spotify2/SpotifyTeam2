Weren't you just so fortunate
But you moved out on your own
Thought that things would come easier
But you can't always get what you want

When the world gets a little bit colder
And the sky gets a little bit dark
The drugs you were taking won't fix you
And the distance won't heal your heart

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home
I'll tell you your insane, out of control
And what is it like to be crazy?
Why don't you tell me?
What is it like?

It was just too obvious how you felt no compromise
Every time they handed you a dollar from their pocket only made you feel justified
You say it's heartache
But I know it's a lie
They bought all your explanations
And sold all your goodbyes

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home
I'll tell you your insane, out of control
And what is it like to be crazy?
Why don't you tell me?
What is it like?

Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away for your sacred Sundays
The only way, only way, only way, only way you forget your Mondays
Runaway, run away

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home
I'll tell you your insane, out of control
And what is it like to be crazy?
Why don't you tell me?
What is it like?
