So you say it's over -
you turn and walk away
And love is like a stranger
Who is running out of things to say
Move me over slowly -
softly close the door
You say that you need nothing
But this empty bed is begging for more

Oh! If I could only change your mind
Then we would find love begin
(Change your mind)
If I could only change your mind
Our love would never end

The minutes move like soldiers creeping
through the night
And oh, my heart lies wounded
As love is fighting to survive
(my love is on the line)
