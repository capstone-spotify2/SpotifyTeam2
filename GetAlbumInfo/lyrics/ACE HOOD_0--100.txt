Your are now in tune to the beast mix
I got the key to win and I'm the locksmith
You can say your prayers once the Glock lift
Sleeping' on me Freddie Kruger I'm a nightmare
Fuck all this ace hood you need to chill shit
I body these rappers I got the kill switch
I'm the one get it done and I'm like the SEAL six
Police asking me questions I keep a sealed lip
Oh lord I am the illest you gotta' deal with
She blew my brains out she a real crip
Twelve-hollow rounds in the Glock clip
That shit can get to banging if you set trip
Better watch your Mrs. I'm a shop lift
Go to slamming in this pussy like a mosh pit
Money and power my nigga this is our year
Just know they not on the block if they know the cops there
Damn right hunnit-twenty on the turnpike
Nothing like some head at the red light
She can't get enough, this dick a crack pipe
Let me fuck her to Machiavelli, that's thug life!
Switch the flow up, nigga focused and I'm on that potion
It's hocus pocus, top will disappear you ain't notice
All you niggas bogus, in the beamer picture me rolling
An I'm heavy boastin', fuck your favorite bitch I'm the chosen
Chevy candy coated, I'm the boss I can't get promoted
I got plenty shooters, but you know I just gotta tote it
If its murder homie, then its guaranteed that I wrote it
If its hot I'm on it, get the bussin like I was tony
I'm talking Montana, pretty bitches in my cabana
Fuck your propaganda, richest nigga with bad grammar
Glocks in them dirty hampers, the clip is like a banana
We the best on my back, can you kindly show me some manners?
Nigga hood nation, fuck waiting and fuck patience
I'm a get it now, anybody get traumatized
With that drama time, I'm the one who you idolize
I ain't never lie, gotta ride, they petrified
Hope I never die!
Pussy niggas they ever, try get them televised
Singing more than a lullaby
I was bored nigga, watch get rich or get into war nigga
I kill shit welcome to the morgue nigga!

Donald Sterling feelings I don't like niggas
Every where I go I got my team with me
Only bad bitches ever seen with me
Niggas jealous and they still living
Before I leave this bitch free Meek Milly!
