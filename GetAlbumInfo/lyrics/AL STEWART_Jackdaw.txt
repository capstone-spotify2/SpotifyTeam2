I'm running away on a day like today
Nothing you say could cause me to stay.

Jackdaw  (jackdaw)
Leaving by your back door
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now.

Don't try to follow, just leave it alone
The trains have all left now and the station is closed.

Jackdaw  (jackdaw)
Leaving by your back door
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now.

It's five in the morning and it's rainy and cold
Just go back to sleep now and you won't see me go.

Jackdaw  (jackdaw)
Leaving by your back door
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now
Should be gone by now.
