Good morning sunshine:
Form this dead letter day.
I suppose i should have seen this
But blindness prevails
An easy game girl
Just a simple plan
You said you plan to hurt
But that just means i'll hurt you

I'll ask you that aged-old question
Who am i to blame this all upon
Maybe we'll see each other in our next life
Maybe we'll choke on it, or maybe we'll just be friends...

(and i do, for you)

Alone again in this room
Untill the 15th of june
Adding over all the arguments 
We had in vain
If you would ask girl 
I would give it my touch
We're playing tag across the united states
Halfway undone

I'll ask you that aged-old questionp
Who am i to blame this all upon
Maybe we'll see each other in our next life
Maybe we'll choke on it, or maybe we'll just be friends...

Just take this feeling 
I've asked you a question
And if you see me. 
Forever a question...
