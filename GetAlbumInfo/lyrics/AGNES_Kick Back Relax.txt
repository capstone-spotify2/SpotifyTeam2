All those stars 
Running through your brain 
Passing through 
Like a run-away train 
Sleepless nights 
Powering the fears 
Brought you pain 
And unnecessary tears 

Let me show you 
A sweeter way to exist 
Let me show you 
I've been looking out for your love 

Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love, yeah 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na, oooh 
Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na, oh yeah 

You look outside 
There's nothing there to see 
I'm inside of you 
Where I will always be 
No need to be, the man behind the mask 
Let's remove it 
All you need to do is ask 

Let me show you 
A sweeter way to live 
Let me show you 
I've been looking out for your love 

Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love, yeah 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na 
Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na, oh yeah 

You've been running like the wind 
Too long, too long 
Been fighting after goals 
Too strong, too strong 
It's time to put to bed 
The voices at your head 
It's time to listen to the heart 

I'll be looking out for your love 

Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love, yeah 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na 
Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na, oh yeah 

Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love (Don't you know) 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na 
Kick Back Relax 
Don't you know I've been looking 
Out for your love, yeah 
Kick Back Relax 
Na na na na na na
