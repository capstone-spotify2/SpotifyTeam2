Jenny
So much better now today
You taken all your medicine
And now I'm not afraid
Jenny
They gonna put that ass away
Better stop to smell the roses
On this lovely summer's day

Prisoners issued clothes don't look so fly
But if you take'em off
It could get, it could get you by

You're killing me oh Jenny
Heroin with a college degree
Don't you see oh Jenny
I'm lookin' out for a friend in need
Standing in the corner
Waiting for the punch line
Killing me oh Jenny
Oh you're your own worst enemy

Jenny
So much worse than yesterday
When the drugs stop working
There's a price you have to pay
Jenny
When the blue all turns to black
I'll be picking up the pieces
That you never knew you had

Wake up Jenny, don't go back to black
You're gonna end up giving your daddy
A heart attack

You're killing me oh Jenny
Heroin with a college degree
Don't you see oh Jenny
I'm lookin' out for a friend in need
Standing in the corner
Waiting for the punch line
Killing me oh Jenny
Oh you're your own worst enemy

Tell me lies, tell me little more lies
'Cause if I want the truth
I'll look in your eyes
Tell me lies, tell me little more lies
'Cause if I want the truth
I'll look in your eyes

Heroin
You're my heroin

You're killing me oh Jenny
Heroin with a college degree
Don't you see oh Jenny
I'm lookin' out for a friend in need
Standing in the corner
Waiting for the punch line
Killing me oh Jenny
Oh you're your own worst enemy

You're killing me oh Jenny
Heroin with a college degree
Don't you see oh Jenny
I'm lookin' out for a friend in need
Standing in the corner
Waiting for the punch line
Killing me oh Jenny
Oh you're your own worst enemy
