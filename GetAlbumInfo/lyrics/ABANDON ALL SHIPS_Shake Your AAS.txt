The night is young,
Can you feel the heat?
We got nothing to loose.
(We got nothing to loose.)
This is all we do,
Now can you feel the beat?
It's a party.
(Its a party.)

So leave your problems at the door.
If you come then you better have them no more.
So leave your problems at the door.
If you come then you better have them no more.

If you come then you better have them no more.
So leave your problems at the door.

Come on!
Come on!

Lets go!

We never thought that it would come to this.
