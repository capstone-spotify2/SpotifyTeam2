In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter

I refuse to just exist
In the end we will be missed
I refuse to just exist
In the end we must resist
I will never shatter
Nothing really matters

In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter

I believe in just myself
In the end there's no one else
I believe in just myself
There's no one else
I will never shatter
Nothing really matters

In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter

In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter
(I refuse to just exist)
