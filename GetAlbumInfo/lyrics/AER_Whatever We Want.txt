<i>[Hook - Carter and Dave:]</i>
Jeans with the tuck â rockinâ whatever we want
Bags packed up â haulinâ whatever we want
Showinâ up late â cause itâs whatever we want
Steppinâ on your turf, takinâ whatever we want

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
We rep that F Â­-A-Â­ M, who bring that evening right to the end
Got some good friends out in Japan, word of mouth thatâs how we expand
Itâs a concrete fact I wonât be sleeping on the sidewalk
Donât buy a lock cuz Iâll pop it up and drive off
Pride of the city, provided with eyes of a hawk
Let bygones be bygones it happens a lot
Still stayinâ stoned like Joss
Often misconstrued as a student but Iâm a boss
But weâre on the rooftop baby, with a boom box baby
And a couple more drinksâll get the truth out baby
Time to cool off baby, so weâll pool hop baby
Then spend an afternoon in the boondocks baby
Itâs gon happen regardless
So get on the train, get your sleeping compartments
Yeah you heard correctly, iâm on the market
Speaking bout the FAM from India to the Arctic

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Donât get used to what you see them do, itâs all a mirage
Iâm still pulling up in a Volkswagen Passat, most imagine a lot
And they curious about my whereabouts
Picture perfect world production not produced by Paramount
Iâm living off of these uppers, you smoking on those downers
Itâs Carter Reeves, please call me one of the out of towners
Itâs limitless and boundless, minimal with the doubters
Iâve been around the world at unconventional hours
Itâs old school now, so Iâm bringing it back
From LA to Fenway, they facing the facts
And this pace that weâre at, has the greatest effect
To stay prepping up for whatever is next
Smoking WuÂ­-Tang weed out on the patio
Look no further RZA told me roll a fatty doe
She thinking holy matrimony, she canât fully have me though
Soon enough youâll be hearing this voice upon the radio
