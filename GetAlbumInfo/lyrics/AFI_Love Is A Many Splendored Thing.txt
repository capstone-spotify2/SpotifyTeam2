Ah!
You think you've got the looks,
you think you've got the fashion.
You thought you'd have me wanting more,
but don't like my reaction.
You think you're really something.
You're nothing to me now.
You thought you'd keep me coming
without ever thinking how.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
You think you're really special.
You think I think you're best.
You think you're really something?
You're no better than the rest.
You've got everything you wanted.
Don't let yourself be fooled.
You thought that you could play the game,
but I just changed the rules.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
you!
Why do I hate you.
You think you've got the looks,
you think you've got the fashion.
You thought you'd have me wanting more,
but don't like my reaction.
You think you're really something.
You're nothing to me now.
You thought you'd keep me coming
without ever thinking how.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
