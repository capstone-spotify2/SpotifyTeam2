<i>[Fabolous:]</i>
For me, for me, for me
(She supportive)
For me, for me, for me

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
She be right there when I call, she pick me up when I fall
She so supportive and she got the morals and I'm so in love with it all
She got the shit that I need, and I am the guy of her dreams
She my lil' rida', she my lil' partna'
Is it cause a nigga get paid?
Or baby is it my thuggish ruggish face?
Even if I didn't have nothing
She'll be here to stay, ay
She love me for me (for me, for me, for me)
She love me for me (she do) (for me, for me, for me)
She loves me for me (she do) (for me, for me, for me)
She loves me for me (she do) (for me, for me, for me)

I thank God for the first time that a nigga ever seen yo' face
So beautiful, I want you to know you will never have to worry 'bout a thang
You will never have to worry 'bout lames
Never have to worry 'bout games
The type to make me change my ways
Prolly get a nigga last name
And I fuck with you and I mean it
Your love's all that I'm fiending
When I'm next to you I'm so comfortable
And I comfort you when you need it
I gotta make the moves and go get it
She don't coming between my business
She is such a queen and it is such a dream
For her to love and care for my cherry
All I want and everyday I need it
My expectation's been over-exceeded
Made some mistakes that I never repeated
All of my sidepieces they got deleted
I promise you babe, we gonna make it
We go through struggles but that never break us
We elevated, we meditated
We seen the vision then infiltrate it
Let's go and get to the money
You follow me to the money
Promise to keep it a hunnid
Yay, baby

She be right there when I call, she pick me up when I fall
She so supportive and she got the morals and I'm so in love with it all
She got the shit that I need, and I am the guy of her dreams
She my lil' rida', she my lil' partna'
Is it cause a nigga get paid?
Or baby is it my thuggish ruggish face?
Even if I didn't have nothing
She'll be here to stay, ay
She love me for me (for me, for me, for me)
She love me for me (she do) (for me, for me, for me)
She loves me for me (she do) (for me, for me, for me)
She loves me for me (for me, for me, for me)

You loving me for me
I stole your heart baby that's just the thief in me
You get the D from me
Dead or arrested they don't get no grief from me
She rolling weed for me
Shawty so cool that she even hold heat for me
I know that she fiend me
Shawty ain't want it, she ain't tryna beef with me
Over no he said, she said
Less is causing me bread
If now we maintain
We stay on our A-game
Working out and eating healthy
When I struggle shawty help me
Looking rich and thinking wealthy
I talked to God, he must've felt me
I keep her smiling in them selfies
Swag champion, got to belt me
I'm outchea like I paid the <i>[?]</i> fee
These the cards that life has dealt me
So I told Ace every king need a queen
No I can't jack anything in between
Shawty a 10 in that thing in them jeans
It was 98' when I swing through the scene
She in that 7 that Beamer, it's clean
He in that 6 and that thing looking mean
5 for the bag, gotta swing a Celine
3, 2, 1 that's that ding ding in the ring
See I'm just a value you'll find nowhere else
Once I'm by your side you'll want no one else
