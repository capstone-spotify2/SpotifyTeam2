When I first saw your trespasser
He wandered uninvited to your door
He seemed to know his way around
Although I'd never seen his face before
Pausing for a moment underneath your window ledge
He turned around to see the shadow of the sundial on the hedge
There was a tightness in his face as though he were on edge
I don't know why

You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams

But I seem to see him all the time
You said if there's a trespasser
There must be a footprint or a sign
And what would he be looking for
There's nothing here for anyone to find
And while you tried to say it couldn't be I realized
That you could feel no sense of danger and you didn't seem surprised
I got the feeling that you knew more than you said but felt advised
To keep it in

You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams

But I seem to see him all the time
Now I see your trespasser go wandering alone
Sometimes he's standing by the flowers or melting in the stone
And even when I cannot see him I can feel it in my bones
That he's still there

You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams

But I seem to see him all the time

You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams
You see him in your dreams

But I seem to see him all the time
