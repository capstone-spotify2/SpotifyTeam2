Don't know how it got away from me 
Don't know how I let things go, you see 
Don't know why it took a sudden turn 
Didn't seem to be a big concern 
And everything is all too much
Hot and bothered, you're cool to the touch 
And everyone is worlds apart 
It must have been this way from the start

When there's nothing here to save the day 
Then we have to say 
There's a reason for it 
When there's nothing left for us to do 
You're left without a clue
There's a reason for it 

Don't know how it got away from me 
Don't know how I let things go, you see
Don't know why it took a sudden turn 
Didn't seem to be a big concern 
And everyone is all too well
All well-adjusted people 
Can't you tell? 
And everything is all too fast 
Just add water Nothing's built to last

When your colleagues can't recall your name 
Time and time again 
There's a reason for it 
When your name's the butt of every joke 
Just about to croak T
here's a reason for it 
And everyone is worlds apart 
It must have been this way from the start 
When there's nothing here to save the day 
Then we have to say 
There's a reason for it 
When there's nothing left for us to do 
You're left without a clue 
There's a reason for it 
There's a reason for it 
There's a reason for it 
There's a reason for it
