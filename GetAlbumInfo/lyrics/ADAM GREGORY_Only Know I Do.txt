How do you explain the way the stars just 
hang way up in the sky
How do you explain the way rain goes away 
whenever you walk by

It's a mystery just how life can lead 
to a place you've never been
You've knocked on that door
a hundred times before, when it 
suddenly let you in

I don't know why 
I've been so blessed to love someone like you
I don't know why
I must confess, I only know I do

And how do you explain the way
my world has changed right before my eyes
And how do you explain the way you 
gave me wings
when I swore I could never fly

It's a mystery what you've done for me
I'm at a place I've never been
I've knocked on that door
a hundred times before
now you've suddenly let me in

In my heart, I won't question
I'll just lay here in your arms
