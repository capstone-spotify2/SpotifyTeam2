Late afternoon, the sun's going down
I ca-ca-call on your cell (why's he in such a hurry)
Leaving the room, he's mumbling, too
Asking for his shoes, (just leaving outt he blue)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watching him pacing (wonder who he's stressing)
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door swingin'

You better open your mi-in-ind
To read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines

9 in the morning, up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin restless
(the room is full of questions)
Little replyin, whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin
(so why do he keep on trying)
I s-search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason
(he's changing like the seasons)
Are you still pleasing, well soon you'll be leaving
Which one will be grieving?

You better open your mind
To gotta read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines

Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines

Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines

Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause you'll look up, and I'll be gone
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
'cause I read between the lines

Who got you thinkin' you ishh ain't been stinkin'?
My temperatures peakin'
(why are you barely speakin)
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles
(i'm listening but hardly believing)
Changing the story, or trying to ignore me
Still reaching out for me
(but still I'm hardly reaching)
Give me a reason to put you back on line
You've wasted enough time

I had to open my mind
To read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines

Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines

Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
