Call her sister but she's really not
My friends been asking 'cause they've heard a lot
About the way that she makes me feel, oh yeah
She's not my sister, but she's very real 

Look out! 

I can't change (can't change) my ways (my ways)
I can't change

Call her my sister 'cause we're very close
And you can find her when you need her most
So many times I feel like a shot, oh yeah
Few people know what she's really got, trust me

I can't change (can't change) my ways (my ways)
I can't change
Or rearrange (rearrange) my days (my days)
I can't change 

Call her my sister, but don't you be fooled, listen
'Cause she can take you around the world, yes she can

I can't change (can't change) my ways (my ways)
I can't change
Or rearrange (rearrange) my days (my days)
I can't change  

I can't change (can't change) my ways (my ways)
I can't change
Or rearrange (rearrange) my days (my days)
I can't change  

Don't want to
