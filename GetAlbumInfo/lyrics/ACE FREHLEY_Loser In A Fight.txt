He's got a holster
Filled up with grief
I wouldn't want to cross his line
I'd end up underneath
(He's) got an angry look of action
Shoot off both your knees
His gun was smokin'
Recently pleased

You don't wanna cross wits
Better not try
You couldn't learn his limits
And you don't have the mind

Loser in a fight
Loser in a fight
Better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done

He's a thinker you can see it
Sometimes the eyes don't lie
And if your head is empty
He'll make your body die
I don't need his aggravation
I'm better than the rest
Better stand up or shut up
(Cuz) soon will come the test

Loser in a fight
Loser in a fight
Better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done

This would be one guy to ignore
If you wanna save your face
From hitting the floor
So now would be the right time!!!

I wouldn't wanna cross wits
Better not try
You couldn't learn his limits
And you don't have the time

Loser in a fight
Loser in a fight
Better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done
