Well I drove down to the ocean
Left my heartache way behind
But the rain won't leave and the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine

So I ordered me up a killer
Found a view out across the sea
I sat down in the sand
A drink in my hand
And in the glass looking back at me

I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go

Well I met an old boy from Georgia
Yeah, his woman done knocked him down
I asked him how's he doing
He stared at me confused
And said, "Hey, ain't you looked around?"

He said the rain won't leave
And the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
And there's something in the bottom of this drink I just got
And it don't look like a worm to me

I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go

So we put our drinks together
And toasted rainy weather
And the women that had done us wrong
Then we threw back margaritas
The bug just made it sweeter
And we both sang a happy song

I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go

Yeah, I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go

Yeah, I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go
