There's no way
There's just no way
I could leave your love behind

If I could live my life all over, I'd do everything the same
The film in my camera would reveal everything the same
Like kissin' you every mornin', lovin' you day by day
Dreaming dreams of you and every old way will

When the sun peeps through my window
I'll have you on my mind
There's no way, there's no way
To leave your love behind

When you hair turns to silver and I'm old and gray
I'll keep on lovin' you, yeah, the same old way
When you come to the end of your journey
If I'm lucky enough to be around

I'll hold your picture to my chest
But tears will be still falling down, yeah
I'll keep you in my memory for the rest of my days
There's no way, there's no way to leave your love behind
Oh, behind, yeah

If I could walk through the garden again, you'd be the flower I pick
The episode of our love would give my heart a kick, yeah
If I could take the song from the top, one more time
I would sing the same old lines, yeah

I'll tell you there's just no way, no, no
There's no way to leave your love behind, behind
Oh, no, I can't leave it behind, oh

I can leave behind
Behind
Can't leave love, no
Behind
There's just no way

Behind
There's no way, no
Behind
It's still no
