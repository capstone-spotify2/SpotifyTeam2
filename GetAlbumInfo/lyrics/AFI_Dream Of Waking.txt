I feel it washing, over me,
slow poisonous tide.
Pins and needles, dance on me
sickness undefined.
Now I'm afraid, to face the sky,
please someone hear my haunting cry.

Please let them waken me, please let them waken me,
please let them waken me, please let them waken me.

Go!

With eyes sewn shut I still can see, I end up somewhere,
all that is surrounding me, somewhere in between,
Between a dream, I end up somewhere,
and motionless reality, will I forever lie?

I feel it binding, so smoothly,
I see myself below,
I feel it gnawing, eating me,
poisonous and slow.
My mind it speeds, my voice has died,
God let me make the faintest cry.

Please let them waken me, please let them waken me,
please let them waken me, please let them waken me.

Go!

With eyes sewn shut I still can see, I end up somewhere,
all that is surrounding me, somewhere between,
Between a dream, I end up somewhere,
and motionless reality, will I forever lie?

Binded by my hands, bind my legs, bind my eyes,
bind my mouth, bind everything.

Opened up, and for the taking,
just one touch and I'll be yours.
Open up, wide for the breaking
just one touch and I'll be yours.

What's on the other side, behind the mirror?
To try, I cry, to break, the static keeping me here in between,
What's on the other, side of the mirror?
To try, I cry, to break, the static keeping me here in between,
the static keeping me here in between.
