Don't be afaid
It's a harmless moon
All we can do
Is to assume

Our lives must change
A change is due
I hear you say
What are we gonna do

I don't know - make it
I don't know - shake it
I don't know - break it down
What are we wanna do
I don't know - make it
I don't know - shake it
I don't know - break it down

O' weeping night
O' grieving sky
O' rabbit wind 
You just flew by

Grant me this
Some small reward
Don't announce
The time of the final call

My dream was this:
Across the sky
A slate-grey cloud
That filled the eye

...a slate-grey cloud...
Comes through the dust - 
Locust

Dont' be afraid
It's a harmless moon
