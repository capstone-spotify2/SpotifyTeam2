Candy came back to amazing acclaim
Saying: âIf this is love give me more of the sameâ
The people were waiting in crowds for the sight 
Of her face in the car driving into the night.

And she says: âThey gotta have someoneâ
âI might as well let it be meâ
âFor all my life was a dreamâ.

In the shops and the factories they talk about you
And the girls in the street wear their hair like you do
Hordes of reporters are always at hand
And the cameras are ready whenever you land.

But she says: âIt couldn't be betterâ
âI don't let it get in my wayâ
âAll my life was a dreamâ.

I'm not sentimental for the ticker tape life
I could lose it all in just the card of the night
So don't you worry about the things that I do
There are times I need to get away from you
But every time I try to close my door 
I seem to fascinate you more and more and more.

Candy came back to amazing acclaim
Through the hot summer night they were calling her name
They seemed to be drawn by the power of her fame 
Like a gull to the water, a moth to the flame.

But she says: âOh, it's not what I didâ
âAnd they saw what they wanted to seeâ
âFor all my life was a dreamâ.
