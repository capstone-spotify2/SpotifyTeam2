It's all a little strange
I never though you'd make me feel this way (didn't know)
I never was the type to stay
I didn't think I'd change
But here we go again, go again, go again

Ohh, don't stop, don't stop
What you're doing to me
It won't stop, won't stop
Coz I'm hooked on you
Don't stop, don't stop mmhmm
I think you should know, you should know, you should know

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Every star up in the sky
Every note from low to high
All the money in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much
Every pebble on the beach
Every song that ever sing
All the diamonds in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much

It's just the little things
The way you smile the way you kiss my cheek (and ya know)
And when you're standing next to me
I find it hard to breathe
Can't get you out my head, out my head, out my head

Ohh, don't stop, don't stop
What you're doing to me
It won't stop, won't stop
Coz I'm hooked on you
Don't stop, don't stop mmhmm
I think you should know, you should know, you should know

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Every star up in the sky
Every note from low to high
All the money in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much
Every pebble on the beach
Every song that ever sing
All the diamonds in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much

Oh Oh, I said I love you, I love you that much
Ohhhhhh, I love ya that much

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Every star up in the sky
Every note from low to high
All the money in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much
Every pebble on the beach
Every song that ever sing
All the diamonds in the world
I love ya that much, I love ya that much
