Parts my fingers' crossed
Ch'yeah, ch'yeah
Hey, hey, hey
YMF, nigga
Hey, man!

It's only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave
It's only cause I care about you
Put a smile on your face
Say the truth will set you free
I'll be your slave

Cause I'm a liar, a cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver
If I was you and you was me, I wouldn't believe you
The tricky part is my fingers' crossed, cause I could even by lying
About being a liar, cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver

And I don't wanna take the time
Said, I don't wanna take the time
To write down, what I feel on my mind, right now
I don't wanna take the time
Never even take the time
To write down, what I feel on my mind right now

I gotta wear shades everyday
It's difficult to figure me out
You're supposed to look a man up in his eye
They don't even know what eye is about
Is he non-fiction or not?
Is it politics or hip-hop?
Do What Thou Wilt
Love is the only law
Love under will, the law is for all
And then I said that I would carry the cross
That wasn't just a quote I stole from Nas (naw)
And like I said, It wasn't written
But still I'm taking over with this ether
And since he got a new bitch
He ain't dropped no new music, either
Told my lady I was an alien; she believed my ass
I said sike!
I didn't tell you E.T. was back

Only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave
It's only cause I care about you
Put a smile on that face
They say the truth will set you free
And I'm your slave

Cause I'm a liar, a cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver
If I was you and you was me, I wouldn't believe you
The tricky part is my fingers' crossed, cause I could even by lying
About being a liar, cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver

If you are
That one girl, very far away
That'll come around when I'm in town
Even with your man from many years
With plans of church and wedding gowns
And other portions of the big picture
You'll leave out of the portrait
That you will paint for me after I perform my recordings
And I say the shit that stimulates your mind, body and spirit
Resonate with your receptors, you never knew existed
Your phone on silent
You got an alibi for your boo
And before you say bye, you say you love me
And I'ma say I love you too

Only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave
It's only cause I care about you
Put a smile on that face
They say the truth will set you free
And I'm your slave

Cause I'm a liar, a cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver
If I was you and you was me, I wouldn't believe you
The tricky part is my fingers' crossed, cause I could even by lying
About being a liar, cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver

Bentley put the gas on 'em, YMF

In the beginning, I created the heavens and the earth
Now, the earth was formless and empty
Darkness was over the surface of the deep
And my spirit was hovering over the waters
And I said, let there be light
