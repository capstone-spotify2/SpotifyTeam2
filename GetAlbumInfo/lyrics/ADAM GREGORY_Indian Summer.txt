The sun goes down on another day 
Feels like winter is here to stay 
Snow clouds gather in the northern sky 
Looks like it's gonna be a cold dark night 
Summer seems like a long lost friend I pray for the warmth of its touch again 
Down in the deepest part of me 
The wintertime comes and the warm sun leaves
The ground gets hard and the heart gets cold 
But I hold on tight to the truth I know 
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner I can feel the warm breeze 
Beginning to blow 
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner 
Though it's cold here inside
And the fire's burning low 
There's an Indian summer coming I know 
The snow owl sings her mournful song 
The grey skies keep on rollin' on 
In silhouette stand bare trees I'm doin' my best to believe 
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner I can feel the warm breeze 
Beginning to blow 
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner 
Though it's cold here inside
And the fire's burning low 
There's an Indian summer coming I know
The sun will be there waiting 
When I need it the most 
Sure as seasons change, there's one thing I know
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner I can feel the warm breeze
Beginning to blow
There's an Indian summer 
Just around the corner 
Though it's cold here inside
And the fire's burning low 
There's an Indian summer coming I know... 
There's an Indian summer coming I know
