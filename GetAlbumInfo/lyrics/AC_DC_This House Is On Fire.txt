Yonder she walks

Yonder she walks
Hitting 103
A little tongue in cheek
Hot personality
She bring on the flames
And it's burning it's burning
My body's achin' tossin' and turnin'
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn in
You

She got me runnin' for shelter
Needing quarantine
She got me red hot and wired
Call on emergency
She bring on the flames
And it's burning it's burning
My body's achin' tossin' and turnin'
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn in
You

You got me burnin' and burnin'
You got me tossin' and turnin'

This house is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
House is on fire

This house is on fire
This house is on fire
House is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn in
I'll bet it's gonna burn
I'm gonna burn
You
