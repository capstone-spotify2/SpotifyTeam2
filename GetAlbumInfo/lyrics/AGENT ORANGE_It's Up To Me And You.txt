Familiar faces seem to come and go.
Where have they gone, I wonder?  
I may never know.
I've seen every grace(?),
I'm looking forward to something new.
I've waited patiently for several years.
What else can I do?

It's up to me and you
Me and you

Another face, another something you can be
I ask for other people, not for you and me and you.
I'll try to explain and I'll give you another clue:
We must improve by learning from the past, creating something new

It's up to me and you
Me and you

That tomorrow waits...
We can make it happen, now today.
Or we can wait forever.
It's up to you

You have accomplished nothing, give yourself a hand.
It may be difficult, but try to understand:
Creating a scene is like learning to tie your shoes.
It takes some time, but it's so easy when there is nothing else to do.

It's up to me and you
Me and you

Let tomorrow wait.
We can make it happen, now today.
Or we can wait forever.

It's up to you.
