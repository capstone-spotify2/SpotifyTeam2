The Orange Blossom Special, the Walbash Cannonball
The Chattanooga Choo-Choo this hobo's seen them all
I've watched the Santa Fe layer smoke against the sky
And listened to old Number Three rolling through the night.

Ride the train, ride the train
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains
Sleeping in a boxcar when it rains
Ride the train, ride the train.

The Southern Pacific, the Overland Express
Up ahead the coal cars with West Virginia's best
And Oklahoma's Frisco the biggest one of all
I've listened to the Silver Speed's lonesome midnight call.

Ride the train, ride the train
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains
Sleeping in a boxcar when it rains
Ride the train, ride the train.

Ride the train, ride the train (ride the train)
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains
Sleeping in a boxcar when it rains
Ride the train, ride the train.

Ride the train, ride the train
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains
Sleeping in a boxcar when it rains
Ride the train, ride the train.

Trains.

Ride the train, ride the train
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains
Sleeping in a boxcar when it rains
Ride the train, ride the train...
