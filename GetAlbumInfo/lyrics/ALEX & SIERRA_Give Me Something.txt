Tonight you can leave your mark
No one's watching in the darkness
Kiss me on the neck, make a beautiful scar
Anywhere you like

No regrets, all bets are off
We don't need the little talkin'
Listen to the madness in my heart
Can you read my mind?

It can be a lonely world
I want forever times forever

So give me something I can't live without
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something I keep dreaming 'bout
All night, all night, oh yeah
Give me something I can't live without

With the hours only 24
Every second's a revolving door
I'm gonna hold onto your heart for sure
Till the end of time

Oh, it could be a lonely world
I want forever times forever

So give me something I can't live without
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something I keep dreaming 'bout
All night, all night, oh yeah
Give me something
All night, all night, oh

Give me something
I can't live without
Give me something
I can't live without

Give me something I can't live without
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something I keep dreaming 'bout
All night, all night, oh yeah
Give me something I can't live without
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something
All night, all night, oh yeah
All night, all night, oh yeah
