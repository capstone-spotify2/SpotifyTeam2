Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I pass myself down to my knees.
Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who will care for the falling?
Who will care for the falling... leaves?

Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who will care for the falling?
Who will care for the falling?

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
Tender, cool breeze, keeps me where I am.
Suddenly here, when I want to scream,
Autumn calms me down, keeps me in my dreams.

Then I went whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I pass myself down to my knees.
Whispering, whispering, those dew drops are glistening,
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who will care for the falling?
Who would care for the falling?

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
Tender, cool breeze keeps me where I am.
Suddenly here, when I want to scream,
Autumn calms me down, leaves me in her dreams.

Keep on falling down, they keep on falling down,
Keep on falling down, keep on falling down.

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
Tender, cool breeze, keeps me where I am.
Suddenly here, when I want to scream,
Autumn calms me down, leaves me in my dreams.

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
Tender, cool breeze, keeps me where I am.
Suddenly hearing, when I want to scream,
Oh, please just cut me down, leave me in my dreams.
