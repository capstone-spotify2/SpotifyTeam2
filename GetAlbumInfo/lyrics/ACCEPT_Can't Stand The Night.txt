Fallin' tears, a broken heart
Here I sit as time goes by
'cause all I had has gone forever
Can't stand the night.

The fun we had, I knew so well
that somethin' so deep inside
The last few days have been pure hell
Can't stand the night.

Love - you tore my world apart
But still I can't escape
You touched me and you hold me
The nights are hard to take.

I know her body, her hair, her eyes
I know she should belong to me
But she's a one man's girl forever
Lovin' deeply why not me.

Love why do I take you and why do you take me
Take my breath, or you take my heart
All you give is pain a curse upon your name
Can't you see, it isn't right
Can't stand the night.

Tell me where I have gone wrong
give me a reason why
Tell me how to win her back
Can't stand the night.

Love why do I take you and why do you take me
Take my breath, or you take my heart
All you give is pain a curse upon your name
Can't you see, it isn't right
Can't stand the night.

Fallin' tears, a broken heart
Here I sit as time goes by
'cause all I had has gone forever
Can't stand the night.

Oceans filled with tears
and mountains made of pain
And my eyes are sad each time
The night it comes back again.

Love why do I take you and why do you take me
Take my breath, or you take my heart
All you give is pain a curse upon your name
Can't you see, it isn't right
Can't stand the night.
