Yea, and I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
Be a real nigga till my casket door closed ah
Dead by the code, and I'm a live by the code
I'm a live by the code
Quit it with the school, this the life I chose

I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitching on no soul
I ride for my niggas until my eyes closed
In love with the money, I don't love these hoes
I solemnly swear <i>[x4]</i>
I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
I'll be a real nigga till my casket door closed

Ok now 12 years old yea, momma in the kitchen
Told her if my brother went to jail I'm never snitchin'
She said boy go wash them dishes
She must think I'm trippin'
Twelve years later boy I still hold my position
Just that decode emit who let no pussies get me
I go to court, I'm drunk as fuck
I'm stressing on that remit
I hit the stand, I raised my hand
And deny all that's against me
The judge man trippin, tryna get my youngest twenty
I'm like no sir, your honor
I don't know any gunners
Don't know when and where and who it was
That's such a bummer, we good
I'm a live by the G shit
And I solemnly swear to keep a bad bitch

I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitching on no soul (never snitching on no soul)
I ride for my niggas until my eyes closed
In love with the money, I don't love these hoes
I solemnly swear <i>[x4]</i>
I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
I'll be a real nigga till my casket door closed

Hold up
Park the Chevy, hopped in the back seat of something
Seats reclinin, curtains closed, they ain't see me coming
Blackjack, no even money
You act bad, you gon get your ass wacked while I'm beating something
Use the line, use the line
If you get hit you go rise with your punk ass
It's steady, put it on like you own that
I got an AK in the drawer mat
With a shoulder strap, that's gon clap
With a sole trigger, that's scar niggas
Every time I own it back
And I done lost too many niggas to be slippin'
Now I don't even fall asleep around these bitches
And it ain't no secret, these niggas out here snitchin'
And them bitches is the ones who is considered the realest

I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitching no soul
I ride for my niggas until my eyes closed
In love with the money, I don't love these hoes
I solemnly swear <i>[x4]</i>
I'm a live by the code, I die by the code
I'll be a real nigga till my casket door closed

Dead by the code, and I'm a live by the code
I'm a live by the code
Quit it with the school, this the life I chose <i>[x2]</i>
