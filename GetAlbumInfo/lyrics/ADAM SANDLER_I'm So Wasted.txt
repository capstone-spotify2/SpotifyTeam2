<i>[M2:]</i> "Oh this beer is great, man. 
This tequila is really strong, man. 
It's got a worm, and everything in it, man."
<i>[Buffoon:]</i> "Fuckin' shit!"
<i>[M2:]</i> "All being in the sun, you're even more wasted. 
Fuckin' shit is right, man! 
I am totally wasted now, man. 
I should maybe get an umbrella or something and go in the shade."
<i>[Buffoon:]</i> "I know a guy who can suck his own dick."
<i>[M2:]</i> "Yeah, I know a guy who can do that too. 
He's the drummer from Molly Hatchet and one night we had two cases of Southern Comfort, man. 
We were so wasted off it. 
I'm serious man."
