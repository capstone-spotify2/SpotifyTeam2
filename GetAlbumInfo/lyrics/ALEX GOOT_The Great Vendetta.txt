Iâve been searching for longer than theyâve
(been force feeding their advertisement to those)
Who are scared of life and how theirs will turn out and this
(goes out to everyone who likes their life how it is)
And those who will never be bothered by turn-outs much greater, 
And successes much better than theirs

You say that you are pure
But I know better.
There's no room for me to
Enter the great vendetta.

They say
"Surprising as this
(might sound to your ears)
You only get one chance
Donât screw it up.
(donât waste)
Your time with romance you must conform. 
You must not try to resist."

You say that you are pure
But I know better.
There's no room for me to
Enter the great vendetta.

They don't understand me, they damn near command me.
I don't know what they're asking for.
Their days are numbered, 
And they mean nothing more to me than the eye can see.

You say that you are pure
But I know better.
There's no room for me to
Enter the great vendetta.
