Memories of youth
Holding the key
Watching off of some more
Treading today
The way she falls, itâs complicated
Sounds of crowds, itâs time to leave

So...
This time youâre at war
Something worth fighting for

Rely on your lions
She rides the lions
Rely on your lions
She rides the lions

What happened to you
Wonât happen to me
Watch you walk through the door
But you ainât the same
You claim to crawl the sacred queens
Living after the things Iâve seen

So...
What are you waiting for
Something worth fighting for

Rely on your lions
She rides the lions
Rely on your lions
She rides the lions
You can rely on
You still deny us
She rides the lions

Well it ainât the truth
Will I even care
Where youâre coming from
All I can do
Was sit there and stare
You wanted reliance
She asked for compliance
Well thatâs what youâll get
So thatâs what youâll get

Rely on your lions
She rides the lions
Rely on your lions
She rides the lions
You can rely on
You still deny us
She rides the lions
Rely on your lions
Rely on your lions
Rely on
