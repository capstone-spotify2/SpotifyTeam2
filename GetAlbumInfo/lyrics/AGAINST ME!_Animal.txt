I was dreaming of your love.
I was lost in your arms embrace.
Our bodies collied together.
Oh, this ultimate betrayal.
The heart will not resign.
What could be said what could be done?
I hold out hope for your reciprocation.

Like an Animal, 
these thoughts have gone beyond my control.
For pleasure,
maybe just amusement.

This overwhelming urge.
Towards you I feign disinterest.
While I covet the attention.
While I crave your affection.
Ravenous with lust.
Jackal in heat, spit dripping.
This mechanical impulse knows not loyalty or mercy.

Like an Animal,
these thoughts have gone beyond my control.
For pleasure,
maybe just amusement.
