Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
And Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child
Is gonna spy to see if Reindeers
Really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times, many ways;
"Merry Christmas to you"
