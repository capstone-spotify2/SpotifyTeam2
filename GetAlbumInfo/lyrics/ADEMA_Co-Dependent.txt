Most people don't care
Some people just fear
There's so much pressure
That our lives will feed us
Don't need a reason
I will get even
This is the season
Where I feel so manic

You hurt yourself
And blame me when you fall (codependent)
You have lost control
And crashed into a wall (codependent)
Life has found a way
Where karma slaps you in the face
You depend on me
For everything (codependent)

I am the bad seed
It fuels my own needs
I never was scared
To take my chances
I see the downfall
Cause I'm not social
I've got my own life
And you can't stand it
