Breakin' balls, bangin' walls
Work hard and tough, and I want some rough
Unpack my bags, and take a drag
When bang on nine, and dead on time

Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Livin' out her dreams
Rippin' off my jeans

You are a ballbreaker

Engine roll, time to go
A razorback, a hog attack
Buildin' steam, whippin' cream
She likes a fat, smokin' stack

Hangin' off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke:
'honey shoot your load'

You are a ballbreaker

Wreckin' ball, let it roll
You are a ballbreaker
Buildin' steam, whippin' cream
You are a ballbreaker
