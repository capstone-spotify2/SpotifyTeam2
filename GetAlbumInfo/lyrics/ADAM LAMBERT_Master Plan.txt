You run away from everything that you fear
So afraid don't wanna be a part of it
You see the fake in every thing that is real
You hate the pairadox
You put us in the box

We don't define what makes us right or wrong
Waste of time and we're just livin' it
I wanna see you, touch you, one-on-one
Won't stop until we're done
We've only just begun

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We are the face of a new generation
We are the ones who have no reservation
Don't give a damn 'bout your cold calculation
Welcome to the Master Plan
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
Welcome to the Master Plan

Your skin is burning at the sight of me
Your mask can't hide what yer thinkin'
Don't as (Don't tell)
Just take whatcha need
I'm an open book
So go on and take a look

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We are the face of a new generation
We are the ones who have no reservation
Don't give a damn 'bout your cold calculation
Welcome to the Master Plan
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
Welcome to the Master Plan

There's you
There's me
I feel your energy
I hope you'll see
Things ain't what they used to be
Look at the face

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
We are the face of a new generation
We are the ones who have no reservation
Don't give a damn 'bout your cold calculation
Welcome to the Master Plan
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
Welcome to the Master Plan

Don't care if you under
Welcome to the Master Plan
Don't care if you understand
