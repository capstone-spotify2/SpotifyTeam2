You've talking about your woman
I wish to God... man... that you could see mine
You're talking about your woman
I wish to God that you could see mine
Every time the little girl start to loving... she bring eyesight to the blind
Lord... her daddy must been a millionaire... 'cause I can tell by the way she walk
Her daddy must been a millionaire... because I can tell by the way she walk
Every time she start to loving... the deaf and dumb begin to talk

I remember one Friday morning
We was lying down across the bed
Man in the next room a-dying... stopped dying and lift up his head
And said... Lord... ain't she pretty... and the whole state know she fin

Every time she start to loving... she bring eyesight to the blind
All right and all right... now
Lay it on me... lay it on me... lay it on me
Oh lordy... what a woman... what a woman

Yes... I declare she's pretty and the whole state knows she's fine
Man... I declare she's pretty... God knows I declare she's fine
Every time she starts to loving... whoo... she brings eyesight to the blind
I've got to get out of here... now... let's go... let's go... let's go now
