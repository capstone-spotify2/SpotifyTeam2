10:35 and I hope I've made
The right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Heart is beating, I'm alive
But I don't call this living, no, no, no, no, no-no
Rationalize 'til I'm blue in the face
You cannot lose if you throw the race
I'm still searching for the
Ants' invasion

10:36 and I hope I've made
The right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Ninety eight point four's the bore
With twenty-twenty vision, no, no, no, no, no-no
You want a thrill so you come and see me
A cheap line in fantasy
But I'm still searching for the
Ants' invasion

If I'd the courage I would make my way home
Too many antics in the forbidden zone

10:38 and I think I've made
The wrong decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Another lifeless man
With a strange incision, no, no, no, no, no-no
I hope that insect doesn't see me
He's not renowned for his courtesy
I'm not searching for the
Ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
