Well they moved on down
And they crawled around
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

And you start to scratch
When they start to hatch
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

But when they start to bite
Then it's time you set alight
For an appointment
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment

Well the doctor said
"We got to make 'em dead"
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

And when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take a bitch
For an appointment

Well you rub it on
And you rub it in
Stops them walking
Sideway walking
Gives them the blues

Sideway walking
Sideway walking
They got the blues

You give them the blues
They got the blues
You give them the blues
