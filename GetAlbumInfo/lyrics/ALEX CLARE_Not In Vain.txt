These hearts pushed around too long
Been the reason for a thousand songs
Oh, no why does this ache carry on
Young bones feeling way too tired,
Been traveling for the longest while
Time that I carry on
No it's not in vain
When you feel the pain,
Hope is not in vain

When the world crumbles at your feet
Hanging your head down in defeat,
Just push through
Just push through
Been drifting down without a home
Going back &amp; forth dragging my bones
Got to keep pushing on
No it's not in vain
When you feel the pain
Hope is not in vain
Hope is not in vain
