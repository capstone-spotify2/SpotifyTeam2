Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love

Doin' the road
Get the music done
And move along
What good does it do
To play your songs for her
And hear her say

Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love

You're rollin' along
Life's been good to you
An even so
She comes to you
Late at night
The time you hear her say
Once again...

Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love

Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
