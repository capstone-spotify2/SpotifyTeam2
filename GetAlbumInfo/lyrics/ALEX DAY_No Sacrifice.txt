I wish I could be the person everybody thinks that I'm not
Surrender to an image until personality becomes lost
I don't want to be the one who always leaves you out in the rain
Every time I try I end up making all the same mistakes

I wish I could stop reacting badly when you speak to me
Push away reaction and just show you what I want you to see
I don't want to be the one who's always getting in your way
If I let you go, you could be better for it anyway

I can see who I want to be, but I'm not sure I can reach it anymore
I've got no sacrifice, the fantasy of you left me unsure

I think if I think too much I'll think myself away from you
Thinking never does anyone good if it is all too soon
Memories are remedies to stop me wanting you too much
Memory's my ecstasy to keep me craving you enough

Never have I met another person who is quite like you
Moving on without you would be such a stupid thing to do
Why must you be laughing in my head if I don't want you there?
Why do I indulge a single moment to making me care?

I can see who I want to be, but I'm not sure I can reach it anymore
(I wish I could be the person everybody thinks that I'm not)
I've got no sacrifice, the fantasy of you left me unsure
(I wish I could stop reacting badly when you speak to me)
I can see who I want to be, but I'm not sure I can reach it anymore
(I think if I think too much I'll think myself away from you)
I've got no sacrifice, the fantasy of you left me unsure
