No

Here in the dark
Escaping this withering soul (My thoughts are growing cold)
Here by my side is everything I've ever owned (I've got to go alone)

And I don't mind at all (I've got to let you go)

It's the black clouds over your head
It's the monsters under your bed
As tragic as this might seem
We can't escape the bad things
You know what that means

No

Here in the light
I'll drown in what I'll never be (I've got to watch the glow)
And here by my side swallow swallow the worst part of me (Got no place to go)

And I don't mind at all (I've got to let you go)

It's the black clouds over your head
It's the monsters under your bed
As tragic as this might seem
We can't escape the bad things
You know what that means

Something better change real soon
I don't think I can wait for you
Something that I have to do
I swear that I will see this through
Something better change real soon
I swear that I will see this through

It's the black clouds over your head
It's the monsters under your bed
As tragic as this might seem
We can't escape the bad things
You know what that means
It's the black clouds over your head (Under the black clouds)
It's the monsters under your bed (I'm a monster)
As tragic as this might seem
We can't escape the bad things
You know what that means
You know what that means
You know what that means

You can't escape me
You can't escape me
You can't escape me
