My mind is invaded
My gates are ignored
My thoughts are negated
And you're on a roll

And I am offended
By your acts of shamelessness
Your lack of conscience
And your flagrant steamroll

What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?
What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?

My sorrow is left off
My rages discounted
My fears are founded
This dam is no more

What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?
What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?

Don't touch me
My body is frozen
Thanks to you
And I've sat with these secrets
I'm no longer willing to

What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?
What part of no do you not understand?
Do you not understand?
