The sweltering heat sweeps through the blood, raising internal rage.
The escalation of annoyance converts fingers to fists.
Ready to smash the moral wall retaining the release, restraining the release.
Wash over placid with flooding waves of hate.
Diverge the silence with cathartic piercing screams.
Unleash on your enemies a sweeping firestorm.
Laying devastation upon those who haze you.
Forever they curse you.
Forever loathing the day they unraveled the fabric of your innocence.
Gnawing at every tame fray, leaving only vengeance.
A sheltered source of inspiration for your master plan to lay everything to waste.
With no aggressor, without a foot to stamp out every garden of hope.
Plant a row of remorse, and a crop of forgiveness.
Raise yourself in a better world.
