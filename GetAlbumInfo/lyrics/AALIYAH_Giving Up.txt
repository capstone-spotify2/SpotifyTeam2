Mhmm
Ohh, ohh
Yeah

Giving up, mm, is hard to do
When you really love someone
Giving up, so hard to do
When you still depend upon, his warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
Ooh, they used to mean so much, mm
And bring you happiness, oh, oh, oh, ohh

Giving up, so hard to do
I've tried, but it just ain't no use
Giving up, so hard to do
I said I've tried, but it just ain't no use
But my light of hope is burning dim
Oh but, mhmm, but in my heart I pray
That my love and faith in the man
Will ohh, will bring him back to me
Aye hey, aye hey

I said the man is all I got, oh, yes he is, yeah
And giving up, giving up is so hard to do
Oh, oh, oh, giving up, heyy
So hard to do, heyy, heyy, giving up
So hard for me to do
I said I've tried it, hey
Can't break through
I don't wanna lose you
Cause you mean so much to me, heyy
Ooh, giving up
