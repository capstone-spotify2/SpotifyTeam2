You take me high, out of the blue,
You're by my side whenever I need you
The way you smile, the way you move,
Why should I try, I can't get over you.

All through the night you take me on
When we unite, I know where I belong
When winter reigns, I'll be your friend
What we create, may last until the end.

And through the time that's passing by
I hope you'll always be, you'll be forever
The way you are, the way you are.

Where mountains rise, I'll stand by you
My heart assigned, like only lovers do
If we're apart, I'll cross the sea
Don't close your heart, this love was always free.

And through the time that's passing by
I hope you'll always be, you'll be forever
The way you are, the way you are.

And if you leave, don't go too far
In your beliefs, just be the way you are
The way you are, the way you are.

Just be the way you are
The way you are, the way you are.
