This one's for history's sake
So I won't forget how it felt to lose you
When I break I'll let everyone see
Having the pain means there was once pleasure
And If I turn back time
If had once more chance
Would I say the same thing?
Would you break up with me twice?
And if you saw me now
If you heard the sound this guitar makes
Would it make you miss me at all?

I wrote this down
So if I donât love you tomorrow
Iâll know I love you now
Thatâs our last tragedy
The damage yet done to my memory

No one will doubt me again
When I say that I was in love
And at times it was perfect
And itâs hard to let go
But losing our future wonât cancel our past
And if let you down
If I pushed you away
Then I donât deserve my right to complain
And if youâre doing fine and thereâs light in your eyes
Maybe I was holding you back all this time

I wrote this down
So if I donât love you tomorrow
Iâll know I love you now
Thatâs our last tragedy
The damage yet done to my memory

This one's for history's sake
So I won't forget how it felt to lose you
This one's for history's sake
So I won't forget how it felt to lose you

I wrote this down
So if I donât love you tomorrow
Iâll know I love you now
