Don't fall for it
Don't fall for it
Don't want to be like that
Don't want to look like you
Top Gun Top Gun
It's a big con big con

Get your kids out on the street
Show them how to use those feet
I'm all for progress pretty please
If we're not careful we'll all end up
Right wall-ees

Well got your laptop
Good for you
Your knight in shinning armour
Promises a future
I'll be a dinosaur baby
And bollocks if it don't suit ya

I'm tired of your shit
Tired of your bullshit
Tired of you
Tired of your shit
Tired of your bullshit
Tired of you
Here we go
Another revolution
Hippy breadheads
And their geeky solutions
