In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne

Lookin' back it doesn't seem so long ago
He was bigger than life, God rest his soul
Why he died that day is hard to understand
Right there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
So tip your hat to the cowboy every once in a while
And take time to remember that cowboy's smile
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne

No buckles on a shelf collecting dust
Still his memory shines inside of all of us
Some miss their hero, some miss their friend
His mom and daddy long to see their little boy again

<i>[Chorus]</i>

In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
If you're washed in the blood someday you'll see him again
But it won't be in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
