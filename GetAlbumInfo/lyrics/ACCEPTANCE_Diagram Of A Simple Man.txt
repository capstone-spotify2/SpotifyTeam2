Put on my nametag
Stare in the mirror
Give me some answers
Make it clearer now
And then I'm in my head

As the sun is getting older
While the clock is counting over
Am I more than this?

We get caught up between the sea and the sky
Give me that look in, that look in your eye
We live in black and white
We dream in color

Met a stranger near my station
Says you're alright
Take a vacation
The things to see before I'm dead

As the air is getting colder
While the years are turning over
Where will I exist?

We get caught up between the sea and the sky
Give me that look in, that look in your eye
We live in black and white
We dream in color

We dream in color
And we live in black and white

We get caught up between the sea and the sky
We get caught up between the sea and the sky
Give me that look in, that look in your eye
We live in black and white
We dream in color

We dream, we dream in color
And we live in black and white
We dream, we dream in color
And we live in black and white
