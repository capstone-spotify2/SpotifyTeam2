I said that I missed her, but I didnât mean it
And then when I kissed her, wasnât her Im seeing
I canât help my feelings from fading away
Its not her I picture when Iâm up daydreaming
So I went and wished her well
Canât find a reason to stay together with you these days

Hereâs comes the rain, to wash away the thought of you yeah
Thereâs go the pain, and all the shit you put me through
Was such a fool for you, i donât know what to do
Here comes the rain, help me forget your name

I said I would visit but i didnât make it
Another chance given, another mistake that doesnât seem to trouble me at all
I promised to listen but i was escaping from inside your prison
This rain is erasing the past we shared so let it fall
Let it all fall, let it all fall
A new days coming with the presence of the sun
And lately Iâve been looking nowhere but up
Let it all fall, let it all fall for a better tomorrow
And forgetting the sorrow, Iâll be moving along

Hereâs comes the rain, to wash away the thought of you yeah
Thereâs go the pain, and all the shit you put me through
Was such a fool for you, i donât know what to do
Here comes the rain, help me forget your name

And now the sun is shining bright
After the rain comes the light
Canât waste our time on a fight
Just keep on keepinâ on
