With a different atmosphere
It's a world where there's no darkness

Just close your eyes and have no fear
'Cause Paradise is here, yeah

There's a place not far from here
With a different atmosphere
Let's leave reality behind us

'Cause Paradise - I'll take you there, whoa, yeah
Just close your eyes and have no fear
'Cause Paradise is here
