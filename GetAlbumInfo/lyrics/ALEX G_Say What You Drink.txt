I'm your temporary valentine
When the poison's got you seeing blind
And it sucks that you'd apologize
For saying what you felt last night

I pray this night will never end
'Cause you'll turn back to you again
And I'm left here wondering
If anything you said was real

'Cause you only say what's on your mind
When your head is clouded from the wine
When you spin my wheels you waste my time
Here we go again...

You only compliment me
When you're drinking,
You say I'm number one
You only list the things
You love about me
And then the morning comes

How he melts me like chocolate,
The man of my dreams
He's sweeter than candy,
But not what he seems
You only compliment me
When you're drinking
And baby that's no fun

You say what you think think think
When you drink drink drink
That's the only time
And it's such a pity
You say what you think think think
When you drink drink drink
Is that the only time
That you think I'm pretty?

Baby have you seen the guy
Who swept me off my feet last night
Or do you only accidentally let him out
When you're out of your mind?

'Cause you only say what's on your mind
When your head is clouded from the wine
When you spin my wheels you waste my time,
Here we go again...

You only compliment me
When you're drinking,
You say I'm number one
You only list the things
You love about me
And then the morning comes

How he melts me like chocolate,
The man of my dreams
He's sweeter than candy,
But not what he seems
You only compliment me
When you're drinking
And baby that's no fun

You say what you think think think
When you drink drink drink
That's the only time
And it's such a pity
You say what you think think think
When you drink drink drink
Is that the only time
That you think I'm pretty?

Get away from me,
Don't make me believe
Don't put me on a cloud
Then watch me drop

Get away from me,
Don't make me believe
'Cause I'll never survive
If I fall from a mountain top

You only think think think
When you drink drink drink
When you think think think
When you drink drink drink

How he melts me like chocolate
The man of my dreams
He's sweeter than candy,
But not what he seems

You only compliment me
When you're drinking,
You say I'm number one
You only list the things
You love about me
And then the morning comes

You say what you think think think
When you drink drink drink
