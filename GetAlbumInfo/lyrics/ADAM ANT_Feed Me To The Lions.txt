Too emotional am I?
Too emotional am I?
With a spirit soaring ten miles high
I sing loud words that make me cry

Too emotional are we?
Too emotional are we?
Defying all security
I mean to keep this fire in me

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
'Cause you're feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions

<i>[VERSE]</i>
Too emotional are you?
Too emotional are you?
With just one heart to see you through
A world where facts are so untrue

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[VERSE]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
Feeding me (hey, ho, hey, ho)
To the lions
