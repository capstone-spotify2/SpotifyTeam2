I'm there to greet you when your life begins
You'll start your journey on your knees and hands
I offer many choices an' places you can go
'Cause you must choose 'cause I'm just the road

I'm paved with mem'ries, glory and regrets
I'm lined with broken dreams and cigarettes
You can take all you can hold but if you stumble b'neath your load
Don't blame me; I'm just the road

I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road

Road to riches, the path of righteousness
Through busy cities, or through a mountain mess
I'll take you through the high way or snake you through the low
But it's your call, I'm just the road

I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road

Your last breath is not the death of me
I'll take you on to where your ticket reads
To that place where I hope shinin' angels greet your soul
If they don't, I'm just the road

'Cause I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road

I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road

So don't you thank me don't you blame me
When you're at that judgment throne
'Cause I'm not the reason, I'm just the road
