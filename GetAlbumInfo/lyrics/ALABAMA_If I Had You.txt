If I had you we'd run like gypsies in the wind
We'd be lovers, we'd be friends,
Oh, if I had you.

If I had you, we'd count the stars all one by one
We'd make love 'til they were gone
Oh, if I had you/

'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul
The flame keeps growin stronger there ain't no control
And there's nothing, no there's nothing, no there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I had you.

If I had you, we'd sail the 7 seas as one
We'd never say "It can't be done"
No, if I had you.

'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul
The flame keeps growing stronger 'cause there aint no control
And theres nothing, no there's nothing, I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I had you...
