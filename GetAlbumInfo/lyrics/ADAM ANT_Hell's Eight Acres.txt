Happy as a punk in boystown
No more talk about doing
Going round the twist with heartbreak
You're in need of protection
Not from me but from yourself
Going round the twist with heartbreak
Big brother won't like it
'Cos you're one of life's takers
Go tell the Spartans
We're on Hell's eight acres.
Walked with kings you know, self law
Pencil skirts and that gear
Going round the twist with heartbreak
Crouched and trembling with hate
Mixes both and dies both ways
Going round the twist with heartbreak
Just a little boy in a man's world
Dying on his feet you see
Going round the twist with heartbreak
Busy fighting the inch war
Paws and claws and black velvet
Going round the twist with heartbreak
