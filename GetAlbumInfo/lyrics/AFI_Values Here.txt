What'd you say
When I said we'll be here through tomorrow
In my heart and in my head
Fear of failure
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems
I've never had
I never doubted what I had inside...what I have inside
Values here in my heart
And we'll be here through tomorrow
Every day's a brand new start
Fear of failure
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what I had inside...what I have inside
Fear of failure
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what I had inside...what I have inside
