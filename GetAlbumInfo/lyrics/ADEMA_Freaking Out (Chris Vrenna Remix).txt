I was so much an outcast
No one ever liked me 'cause I wasn't wanted
I was so different from the rest of 'em all
Fucked up on the drugs from all the speed
And I never got no sleep
'Cause I kept on trippin' over what they said
And everything that my mom said made me mad
And everything that my dad said made me sad

Why am I even trying?

I'm crying out, I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out

You keep shootin' those glances
Relating to the rawness of a fucking lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me
Talk like me, walk like me
You keep tripping on everything I wear
Everytime I swear, even when it comes to my hair
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind
I'm not a dumb fool in your life

Why am I even trying

I'm crying out, I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm tripping out, I'm tripping out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Coming down, breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out

Now do you trip? - Are you still tripping on me? <i>[x3]</i>
Why are you tripping on me?
