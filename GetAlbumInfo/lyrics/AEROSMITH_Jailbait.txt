Take me, take me
Take me outside and maybe
Baby, take me
Take me, take me, take me... 

Take it or leave it on a Saturday night 
If what you see is what you get then gimmie me a bite 
Here are lots of ladies, they is real insecure 
Leave it to the boys and the fool on the hill 
Yeaaa.....

Hello baby, yeah it's me 
Don't be no judge, no third degree oh jailbait 
Play the fool and you play the pawn 
Wake up babe, out the door gone, jailbait

Can't let go you got a hold oh jailbait 
What it is, but you believe 
In what you got, got up your sleeve oh jailbait

Put the woodshed, do it to me jailbait

Check the voice, no surprise oh jailbait
