The days that I've spent apart from you
Have been really hard for me
I wanted to be so close to you
And to live my fantasy

Now you've got me climbing on the walls
I can't wait to put down my books and run to you
And now I'm just waiting for your call
Let's go driving down by the sea tonight, baby

Cause all that I've got
I wanna give you
Over and over and over again

Baby I am down
With the games you wanna play
You have got me going now
In every single way
I know you can give me
The things I'm dreaming of
You and me baby we've got
A slammin' kind of love

The way that you're moving to the beat
It's impossible to not look at you, baby
I wanna stay closer to your heat
There's a fire burning inside my body girl

And all that I've got
I wanna give you
Over and over and over again

Baby I am down
With the games you wanna play
You have got me going now
In every single way
I know you can give me
The things I'm dreaming of
You and me baby we've got
A slammin' kind of love

I will give you the world give you the world
Give you the world, give you all my loving 
Baby, baby let me give my love to you
I will give you the world give you the world
Give you the world, give you all my loving 
Over and over and over again
