KEY LIME PIE, infatuation that shouldn't exist,
KEY LIME PIE, indulge and I am in your debt.
KEY LIME PIE, inspire me with foolish love,
KEY LIME PIE, your green filling makes me inept.

Flaky crust is what I lust,
your fresh lime scent is a must.
Take me with coffee, never with tea,
you're the pie that pleases me.
People gawk, "Is that pie green?"
Ask for a bite, "Fuck you, i'm mean."

KEY LIME PIE, cheapest hooker I've ever had,
KEY LIME PIE, last slice gleaming, if you're out I'm mad.
KEY LIME PIE, poke fun and laugh and jest,
KEY LIME PIE, don't bother me digest, KEY LIME PIE.
