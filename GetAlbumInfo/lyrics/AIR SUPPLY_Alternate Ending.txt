There's got to be an alternate ending
There's got to be an easy way out
I've got to make a change to the messages I'm sending
It's all gone wrong, Give me time
It's all my fault, Could have told you
Before it's gone too far

One love, true love, real love can last forever
One love, true love, real love can last forever

Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together
I just want to see you smile and change your mind

There's got to be an alternate ending
There's got be an easy way out
I've got to be the one to say I'm sorry for pretending
It's all gone wrong, Will you wait
It's all my fault, Will you listen...to me

One love, true love, real love can last forever
One love, true love, real love can last forever

Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together
I just want to see you smile and change your mind
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together
I've got no right and I've got no style, but love is blind

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
