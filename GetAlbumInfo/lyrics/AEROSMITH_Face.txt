Behind the wall of my temptation thats where it all began
she tied me up with my frustration and snapped my rubber band
I remember a sweet patchouli she absolutely adored
its all about with who your hanging &amp; she gave me too much rope

shes a queen of my deliusion
shes my zen from wayback when
and because of my confusion is a face without a name

she lived on lucky charms &amp; coffee
and cracker jacks surprise
she had me all reborn and then she killed me with her eyes

shes the queen of my deliusion
shes my friend from way back when
and because of my confusion is a face without a name

try and get a little bit there's really nothing wrong with it if no one see's ya 
what you gonna say when i dont know anyone blame it on the damn amnesia
forgotten love dont got away shes still a name without a face

we did a little nip &amp; tuck then she whispered to my brain
...she said lets fuck then i forgot her name

shes the queen of my deliusion
shes my friend from way back when
and because of my confusion yeah i've come to that conclusion
and she comes to me at all
and because of my confusion is a face without a name
