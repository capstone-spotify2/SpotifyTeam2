Yeah, come on
Let's ride

When there was a boy playin' with my toy
Every single day, oh, it was a joy
I didn't really see, 'til she said to me:
"Have you ever kissed a girl between her knees?"
I said, it's not just a memory, it's a gift that girl has given me
No, it's more, it's a remedy, it's everything every woman needs

I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm gonna eat you out (down, down)
Yeah, I can't get enough (down, down)
All the way down, down on you

Come on, honey, a 2, 3, 4

I can fix that bitter face when I put mine in that place
Make your honey run, 'cause I love the taste
Put me to the test, I'm better than the rest
I'm gonna do to you what I can do best
It's not just a memory, it's a gift that girl has given me
No, it's more, it's a remedy, it's everything every woman needs

I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm gonna eat you out 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
Yeah, I can't get enough
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
'Cause you taste so sweet (down, down)
Yeah, you know what I mean (down, down)
All the way down, down on you

Down, down, oh
Down, down
Oh, I'm going down on you

It's not just a memory, it's a gift that girl has given me
No, it's more, it's a remedy, it's everything every woman needs

I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm gonna eat you out 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
I'm going down, down, down, down, down on you
Because you taste so sweet (down, down)
Yeah, you know what I mean (down, down)
'Cause I can't get enough (down, down)
I'm gonna eat you up
I'm going down, down on you
