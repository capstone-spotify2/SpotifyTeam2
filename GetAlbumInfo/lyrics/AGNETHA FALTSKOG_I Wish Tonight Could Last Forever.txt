It feels so good to be by your side
Oh, darling let me be your guide
From tonight let's stay together.
There's a blue moon up in the sky
Tonight, it's there for you and I
Darling, let my love surround you
Oh, but I'm so glad I found you.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I wish tonight could last forever
Oh, darling can we stay together?
From now on let's vow we'll never part
'Cos darling that will break my heart
And when the light brings tomorrow
Oh, darling, will it bring me sorrow,
Will you let me hold you in this way?
Oh, I wish tonight could last forever.

Tonight I feel it in the air
Just look around it's everywhere
Who knows where the night will lead us?
Oh, it feels so good to hold you tight
Hold you close without a soul in sight
We came together without warning
And stayed together 'til the morning.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh, it feels so good to hold you tight
To hold you close without a soul in sight
Came together without warning
And stayed together til the morning.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh, I wish tonight could last forever.
