Not addicted to night, afraid of the morning
{That} I awake and feel like someone is here
But Iâm laying right out, going darker and darker.
When my skin peels away roses appear and Iâll turn over.

Find me in the corner of the round room
Reaching into dawn to find night blooms.

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason.
Without sight,
I will ever find you.
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I canât stop touching my eyes.

Iâm allied to the night and warring the morning.
I retreat into the dark if someone is near.
You can lay me right out with the right kind of flower.
When my senses slip away lilies appear.

In the hot house youâll find me
Staring at the end, again, in rapture.

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason.
Without sight,
I will ever find you.
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I canât stop

I lick my fingers
(Lick my fingers)
Make my tongue go numb
(Make my tongue go numb)

I chew you from beneath my nails
(Make my tongue go numb)
Put your petals in my mouth.

Put your petals in my mouth.

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason.
Without sight,
I will ever find you.
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I canât stop touching my eyes.
