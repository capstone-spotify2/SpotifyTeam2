Girl I bet you think youâre witty.
The way you dance is oh so pretty.
But I know who you are, deep down, who you are.
And girl I bet you think youâre funny.
Clever texting with emojis.
Well, guess what, girl! Heâs hashtag taken.

So listen closely when I say your childish games wonât scare me away.

And I, I see the truth in your disguise. You ainât fooling this one.
You, youâre used to getting what you want. You ainât winninâ this one. The world will see you through my eyes.
One last thing I must clarify: Youâre not Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, no.

Girl youâve got this way about you, acting dumb like you have no clue.
Well, you know what you did. I know what you did!
I heard you donât like his girlfriend.
Thatâs a text you wish you could unsend.
And this is sweet revenge.

So listen closely when I say your gig is up and hereâs your pay!

And I, I see the truth in your disguise. You ainât fooling this one.
You, youâre used to getting what you want. You ainât winninâ this one. The world will see you through my eyes.
One last thing I must clarify: Youâre not Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, Little Miss Perfect, Perfect, no.
