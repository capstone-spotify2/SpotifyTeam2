What kind of girl, What kind of girl
What kind of man is enough to begin to understand
How love begins so small
From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has
To hold on to
You'll never let her go and you say
What kind of girl

You'll never run any more now the world has come alive
For you, you'll say (how did I once survive)
What kind of girl does it take that gives everything she has
Always to share, her love is everywhere
And you'll say what kind of girl

What kind of girl
What kind of girl
What kind of girl
What kind of girl

From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has
To hold on to
You'll never let her go and you say
What kind of girl

What kind of girl
What kind of girl
What kind of girl
What kind of girl
