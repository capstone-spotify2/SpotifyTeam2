let me remind you all again
that there is never any room
for any doubt
i feel it in my heart, i shout it out
and if i decide to change my ways
it's not because i've found the latest craze
it's just that i've got more to lose this time

you know that you can count on one thing
i would never let you down
as crazy as this world may seem
the thing that keeps it spinning `round
is always there
so close and yet so far

and you can believe it's true
a reason behind everything i do
a twist that makes it different every time
there are those who say "it's all been done"
there's nothing stopping us
from having fun
and that's why i'll be coming `round again

you know that you can count on one thing
i would never let you down
as crazy as this world may seem
the thing that keeps it spinning `round
is always there
so close and yet so far...

...away - but it gets a little closer every day
and i will hold it in my hand before i die
you know there isn't any way that we can lose
and you don't have to be confused
by hollow words that never mean a thing
when tragic things keep happening
to everyone around you
you don't have to be the same
this is the song that begs to set you free
a sparkle in the night
when we come face to face
don't close your eyes
don't ever turn away

because the only way you'll ever know
is if you ever really try
so find out for yourself
then you won't ever have to wonder why
as crazy as this world may seem
the thing that keeps it spinning `round
is you because you're always there
so close and yet so far

always spinning around
you're always there - so close and yet so far
always there so far
