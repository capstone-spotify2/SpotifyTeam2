I've walked a mile in the shoes of a broken man
I've fallen down a thousand times and got up again
there's times I've talked to god like he's my only friend
There's time it seems the devil's trying to take me by the hand

In life, sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you

I'll borrow pages from the life of johnny cash
I've tried to find the answer in the whiskey glass
I've done a lot of things back in my shady past
I've sat on that metal bed living way too fast

Cause in life sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you

And these pictures running through my head as I sat there on that cold metal bed and wonder how I wound up here again

Cause in life you'll find you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
