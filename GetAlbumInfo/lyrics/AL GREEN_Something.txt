Something gotta hold on me
Something gotta hold on me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something is bothering me
(Softly)
Something kinda worrying me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something in that cloud in the sky
Something
Do you feel it passing by?
Whatever it is
Makes me wonder why
Sometimes I sit here and wonder why
Makes me wonder
Birds that fly in the sky
Wonder... They wonder why
Everyday, seasons passing by makes me..
I wonder why
Sometime in the evening it makes me sad
