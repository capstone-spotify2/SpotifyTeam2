You know how to turn me on
In a special way all your own
No one has been where you've gone in so long
Oh baby, you turn me on

Your world fits right into mine
With perfection, time after time
And my world's where you must belong
'Cause baby, you turn me on

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Aww baby, you turn me on
It's aways so perfect with you every time
Aww yeah, I love you

You know, how to turn me on
In a special way all your own
No one has been where you've gone in so long
Oh baby, you turn me on
Oh baby, you turn me on

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Baby you know ever way to turn me on, and on, and on
So why don't you just turn me on
'Cause you know how to turn me on...
