Yeah, yeah

The night is hot, but the neon lights
Make the blood run cold
In the heart of the city

A rich mans heart cries out for help
In the cold dark night
She's so young and she's pretty
She's in his arms tonight

Small town girl
Her momma told her not to stray outside
To walk the straight and narrow line

The big city light
Her fortune and fame were hers to hold
But she thought the streets were paved with gold

But love is the drug she sells
And life is a living hell now
'Cause she's had a change of heart
She thought she had her whole world in her hand

Now her little world has come apart
Like a castle made of sand
She just flying too close to the ground

Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
So she's had a change of heart, ooh
Sometimes it's better not to understand

But love is the drug she sells
And life is a living hell now
'Cause she's had a change of heart, oh yeah
She thought she had her whole world in her hand

Now her little world has come apart
Like a castle made of sand
She just flying too close to the ground
