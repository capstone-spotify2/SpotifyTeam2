They said I should leave her but I won't
Thinking of ways to walk away now but I don't
Even if I could find a cure then I wouldn't try
Cuz there's no way that I can say good bye

I need your 
Love <i>[6x]</i>
Give me your love sick <i>[2x]</i>
Give me that 
Love <i>[6x]</i>
Give me your love breaks
Give me your love sick 
Give me that love
Give me that give me that love <i>[4x]</i>

They said I was wastin' time with you
Said I was crazy only one thing I should do
But I know the pill that I should take it taste bitter
Guess I'm addicted to the pain you put me through

Now 
Yeah gonna be that rhythm something you wanna be that be that rhythm something <i>[4x]</i>

I need your love
Baby I'm, lovesick
Give me that love
Give me your love breaks
Baby I'm, lovesick

Give me that 
Love <i>[6x]</i>
Give me your love sick <i>[2x]</i>
Give me that 
Love <i>[6x]</i>
Give me your love breaks
Give me your love sick 
Give me that love
Give me that give me that love <i>[4x]</i>

Yeah gonna be that rhythm something you wanna be that be that rhythm something <i>[4x]</i>
