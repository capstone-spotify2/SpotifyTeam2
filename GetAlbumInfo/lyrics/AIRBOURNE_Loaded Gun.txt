I've never seen a such smooth hotter figure 
I bet the taste gets sweeter and sweeter 
Like a diamond-head I slither 
I'm harder then a Parthenon pillar 

If one night stands is what you like 
Then c'mon baby lets get it on tonight 

I'm your loaded gun, loaded gun 
Loaded gun, loaded gun 
Let's have same fun until the rising sun 
I'm your loaded gun 
Loaded gun oh yeah 

I got you in my sights 
I can't get you off my dirty mind 
Your body is a temple and I come to worship 

If one night stands is what you like 
Then c'mon baby lets get it on tonight 

I'm your loaded gun, loaded gun 
Loaded gun, loaded gun 
Let's have same fun until the rising sun 
I'm your loaded gun 
Loaded gun, loaded gun 

If one night stands is what you like 
Then c'mon baby lets get it on tonight 

I'm your loaded gun, loaded gun 
Loaded gun, loaded gun 
Let's have same fun until the rising sun 
I'm your loaded gun 
Loaded gun, 

I'm your loaded gun, loaded gun 
Loaded gun, loaded gun 
I'm your loaded gun, loaded gun 
I'm your loaded gun oh yeah and I shoot to kill
