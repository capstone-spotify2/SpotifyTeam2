You've been wishing on stars
That I could be where you are
Love will dry all your tears
Cause I'm already here

When you're sleeping
You can reach me

So close your eyes
Rest your head
Dream of me when you're in bed
Kiss me, sway, say good night
I'll sing you a lullaby

In the morning, when you wake
I'll be gone with yesterday
All day long, you wonder why
You'll sing in a lullaby

Sleep all night
Sleep all day
For a moment with me

Here with you where I'll be
As long as you stay asleep

When you're sleeping
You can reach me

So close your eyes
Rest your head
Dream of me when you're in bed
Kiss me, sway, say good night
I'll sing you a lullaby

In the morning, when you wake
I'll be gone with yesterday
All day long, you wonder why
You'll sing in a lullaby

Lullaby
Hey ah hey
Lullaby (lullaby)

In the morning, when you wake
I'll be gone with yesterday
All day long, you wonder why
You'll sing in a lullaby

Just say the word
When you need me to hold you
Whenever you're hurt
I'm here to console you

Love you still the sunrise comes
Passing stars you're wishing on
Please go steeper, we should dream of

So close your eyes
Rest your head
Dream of me when you're in bed
Kiss me, sway, say good night
I'll sing you a lullaby

In the morning, when you wake
I'll be gone with yesterday
All day long, you wonder why
You'll sing in a lullaby

Lullaby
Oh-oh
Lullaby (lullaby)

In the morning, when you wake
I'll be gone with yesterday
All day long, you wonder why
You'll sing in a lullaby

Lullaby
Oh-oh
Lullaby

In the morning, when you wake
I'll sing you a lullaby
