Baby, Baby, Oh
Do you want to see me
Never really want to fight the feeling
And I like the color of your eyes
Baby baby
Many times the words are spoken
No doubt somebody will decide

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on

Maybe you don't wanna be here
Cause time after time gets riddled
And I know the price you've paid turn away
Someday everything you want
And desire
To find another way move higher
And I know the price you've paid turn away

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on

Maybe you don't wanna be you
Cause everything we do gets mirrored
And I know the price you've paid get away
Someday everything you want and desire
Will be the thing that gets you higher
Cause I know the price you've paid turn away

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on

It's a flashback baby
Woo woo woo
You got me seeing things
I never would see before
And now I flashback
I've hit the roof
And now you're loving it
And you're wanting it
I'm not losing it over you boy
Flash baby woo woo woo
You got me seeing things
I never would see before
And now I flashback
I've hit the roof
And now you're loving it
And you're wanting it
I'm not losing it over you boy

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
