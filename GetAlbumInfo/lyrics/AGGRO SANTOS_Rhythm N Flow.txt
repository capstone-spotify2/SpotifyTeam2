When I'm in the club I'll be holding my stance
Observe the prey then counter advance
If she wants to dance then I'll give her a chance
But one fing I don't wanna hear is I can't
When I blow, flow, flow
It get so hot it blows the metre
I wanna go go go so hard it will blow up the speaka

A
Out all your girls you the nicest
I got the kimbo bars they can't fight it
We should get together be the flyest
You anit got the slightest
So that's why I advise it
I got past
Check my attendence
You looking good something I should mention
And tell your boyfriend not to judge me even though I get payed every time I give a sentence

If you taste the power get down
Bringing you the finest in town
I provide that feel good sound
And I no u need it

Get wi wi wid it let's go
The crowed love wat I say when dj sets play
So wi wi wiggle it slow

Get wi wi wid it let's go

And I can get them quick
And there three of them three of us
