So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.

So honey lets find a little fun, make a little noise, throw a little sawdust on a hardwood floor,
wanna shine that buckle, while Iâm holdinâ you tight, on a good time lonestar Saturday night

Naw, donât worry bout the preacher man, he used to play fiddle in a honkey tonk band.
Iâll have you there bright and early in the front row pew, Lord knows I love lovin on you

So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.

Call your Mama, tell her donât wait. Leave the light on cause weâre gonna be late.
Gonna do it up right, Gonna shut the place down, Gonna find a highway a little ways from town, 

Down a dirt road, past a windmill, round the pumpjack just over the hill,
thereâs a tire swing hangin from a live oak tree, we can flip skinny dippin down in the creek

So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.

Girl let me love you, like its our last night, I wanna see the stars in your eyes,
Then make a little magic there in the moonlight, and top it off with a Texas sunrise.

So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.

So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.
