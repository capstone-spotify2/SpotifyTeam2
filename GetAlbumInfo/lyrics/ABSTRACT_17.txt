Used to dream 'bout this
Looking up to stars
Steady plotting on a wish...
This is how a heart breaks
This a hit made off a lot of missed takes
This a boy turned man through the music
This a grind five minds turned into a movement
This a blueprint to the top you can cruise with
Get you out yourself doubt, make you wanna do shit
This a warm light, to a dark night
Eyes on the town watching over like the Dark Knight
I got done wrong, so you know I had to do right
You know what I done, I ain't gotta set the mood twice
Out the town, to the city, from the city overseas
Couldn't do this on my own
I knew I would need the team
Dreams get dream't when the lights turn low
But the grass ain't green where the lights don't show
17, I was out for revenge, yes
I know I can never make amends, yes
I know I was standing at the edge, yes
But you don't know the meaning of depressed, yes
You're nobody till somebody let's you down
And you ain't ever gonna swim until' they let you drown
Go from pieces on the ground to the peace you found
Record pieces of myself, this a piece right...now

22 and I'm way more wise to the fact that the world
Makes plans that the mind can't hatch
No heart makes dreams work and time can't match
And I choose to be truth, nothing rhymes like
Said "I'm 22, way more wise to the fact that the world
Makes plans that the mind can't hatch
No heart makes dreams work and time can't match
And I choose to be truth, nothing rhymes like that."
