There's a teardrop
Falling slowly from my eyes tonight
As I think of your two arms
That used to hold me so very tight
But you're gone now
And girl I'm alone and blue
With just these pictures and memories of you

Pictures and memories
Of a love warm and true
Pictures of love we shared
And the memories of you
But your pictures can't heal my chest
Of this hurt deep inside
Pictures and memories
I feel like crying tonight

I may be crazy but you know sometimes
I can almost feel your touch
Those who say I should be over you
Well I guess they just never loved as much
I'd put your pictures where I can't see them
But I'd still see them in my mind
Just like your memories,
They're right here with me all the time

Pictures and memories
Of a love warm and true
Pictures of love we shared
And the memories of you
But your pictures can't heal my chest
Of this hurt deep inside
Pictures and memories
That's why I'm crying tonight

Pictures and memories
I feel like dying tonight...
