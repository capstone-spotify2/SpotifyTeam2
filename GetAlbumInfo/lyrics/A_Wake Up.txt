Dirty fingers, please believe us
Everybody dies
Guilty perfect, murder suspect
That was not your crime

You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)

You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you

The weight has been hard on your back
You're wearing well out of respect
Slowly it's dragging you down

I'd never call it that
You're running away and you feel
The voices are way too loud

You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)

You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you

I can be sorry for this
So give me the pain I will swallow it
I can be taller than this
So light up the way, I will grow with it

I can hail Mary's for this
So I can remain always positive
I can be smarter than this
And then I can be on my

Way, way, falling for it positively
Moment that I saw you in the way
Oh, way, oh, way, oh, way

You never do nothing and that's all you do
You never get lonely and nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up

Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you

Got no feeling, got no reason
Out of rhythm, feels like prison
