Even if it rains, and the sun won't shine, sun won't shine.
Whatever the weather you'll be mine.

All of this noise!
Distracts me!
Fear him now!
Let there be light!

Through the worst weather.
I'll make sure we're together.
When the sky begins to hail,
We will prevail.

WE WILL PREVAIL!

The beauty in the eye of the storm!
Is where I stand when I feel your grace!
I forget about my pride and my place!
Just take me from here!

Take me from here

Even if it rains, and the sun won't shine, sun won't shine.
Whatever the weather you'll be mine, you'll be mine.
Let's watch the rain fall,
And wash away our innocence.
In the clouds I hear the chorus sing.
Hallelujah...

I'm tired of this
The walls are closing in on me
I need an escape (I need an escape)
Don't stand in my way (Don't stand in my way)

Through the worst weather.
I'll make sure we're together.
When the sky begins to hail,
We will prevail.

Even if it rains, and the sun won't shine, sun won't shine.
Whatever the weather you'll be mine, you'll be mine.
Let's watch the rain fall,
And wash away our innocence.
In the clouds I hear the chorus sing.
Hallelujah...

We are the heard and he is our shepherd.
We are the heard, we're in this together.

Put the south in your mouth and swallow, swallow.

We are the heard and he is our shepherd.
For now and forever, we're in this together.

He whose without sin cast the first stone!

But, who are you to judge?!
But, who are you to judge?!
But, who are you to judge?!
