I'm getting stronger and I'm no longer fighting by myself.
For now locked doors are opening for me!
No turning back, I have to get out, get out, get out!
Before it's too late.
My child, I am the way!

Do you think it's wrong of me to long for you despite how you taste?
I'm not the one to give up on you now.
I'll never leave the ground without having to let go, yeah!
Every time I try I'm further from the sky.
I wish that I could let go, I'm lost in your beautiful trance.

Grit my teeth, you're mine, I'll make it painless!
Say your last goodbyes, I'll make it painless!
Take a breath and I will make it painless!
Guess again, guess again, guess again!

I'm exhausted.
I have to get up, get up, get up!
Get up on my feet.
My sweet, I am the light!

Do you think it's wrong of me to long for you despite how you taste?
I'm not the one to give up on you now.
I'll never leave the ground without having to let go, yeah!
Every time I try it just gets harder to find.
Darling cry for me!

Call to me, there's nowhere to run!
Sing to me, there's no way to climb!
There's nowhere to hide, this is where I'll die!
My God, why!

In reverie I smile imagining when I will lie close to you.
And we won't have to worry but watch the sky dance for us instead.

I think I want to I want to sing you to sleep, with you I want to dream.

I'm not the one to give up on you now.
I'll never leave the ground without having to let go, yeah!
Every time I try I'm further from the sky.
I wish that I could let go, I'm lost in your beautiful trance.

Suddenly I'm floating so far from you.
