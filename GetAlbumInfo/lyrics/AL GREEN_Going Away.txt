Life can be hard if you live in vain
Trials can't be hard if you depend on God
I will not worry, I won't be afraid of hope
I'll look to Jesus who says, 'I'm the Way'

Come and go with me to my Father's house
Let's go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away

It's nothing but peace
When you're gone away
It's nothing but joy
When you are gone away

Let me tell you
You'd better go this way, if your woman see the day
Let her go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away

Hey, hey, <i>[?]</i>
And I won't be there, I'm going away
I don't know about you
I find you're nothing but joy, I'm going away

We'll pack my bags up
With the soul that I've had, I'm going away
Nothing but love over there
Sometime I happen to <i>[?]</i>
I'm going away

I'm still way by myself
And I say, I'm going away
I still wait by myself
As I, I'm going away

I'll tell you one thing
There's nothing but love and joy
<i>[?]</i> I'm going away
All the way

I have to love you
I'm going away, I'm going away
Jesus' coming back to take me by the hand
To lead me to the land, I'm going away
