I pace the length of my unmade room
In times of change
My bags are packed, guess I'm leaving 
the womb
Into the rain

We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried

Toes in the sand, the seductive sway
Ooh...nothing better, babe
Across the bay--Sarasota Way
We held together

We never found 
A place to hide
Some peace of mind 
God knows we tried, yeah

Into the rain:
The summer rain

So we walk down to Memorial Beach 
Where things began
Honey days and nights without sleep
Lost in the sand

We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried, yeah

We never found
