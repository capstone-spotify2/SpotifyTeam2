Hey driver, where're we going
I swear my nerves are showing
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die

Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people...I'm the one they blame
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away
In the living daylights

All right, hold on tight now
It's down, down to the wire
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die

Comes the morning and the headlights fade in rain
Hundred thousand changes...everything's the same
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away
In the living daylights

Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people...I'm the one they frame
In the living daylights
