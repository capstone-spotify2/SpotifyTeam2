You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Crawling like a helpless infant on the floor
You turn down bread for the want of a steak
What's worth waking up in a cold sweat for?
You know, it could have been good
And it could have been fine, you know
You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Devastated they don't really give a damn
As you wait around for someone to do it all for you
You know they gonna make you pay through the nose
On a very rare occasions that they do
The more innocent you are
The more you will learn, you say
You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Yeah, You're living up to someone's image of yourself
You're living up to someone's image of yourself
Oh you
Don't need opinion
Don't need a mirror
Believe that you're enough
And you
Tapped at my shoulder
Captured my heart
I thought your name was love
Thought your name was love
You
Don't need opinion
Don't need a mirror
Believe that you're enough
And you
Tapped at my shoulder
Captured my heart
I thought your name was love
I thought your name was love
Its just an image of yourself
Just an image of yourself
