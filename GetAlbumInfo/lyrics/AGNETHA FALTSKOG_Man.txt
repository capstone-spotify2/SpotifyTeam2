You are beside me, I'm part of you now
Love of my life this moment was made for us somehow,
Where did you come from and how did it start,
Was it a star from heaven that brightened up my heart?

That light keeps shining on me
Since you walked into my life,
You're here and now I can see
Whatever it takes, take care of me.

Oh man, don't make me cry,
Don't let it die,
'Cause deep inside I really know
That after you, what would I do?

So man, don't ever go, I need you so
This love, this feeling's gonna grow
I love you,
I do.

That light keeps shining on me
Since you walked into my life,
You're here and now I can see
Whatever it takes, take care of me.

Oh man, don't make me cry,
Why don't we try,
'Cause deep inside I really know
That after you, what would I do?

So man, don't ever go, I need you so
This love, this feeling's gonna grow
I love you,
I do.

I love you,
'Cause deep inside I really know
That after you, what would I do?

So man, don't ever go, I need you so
This love this fellings going to grow
I love you,
I do....
