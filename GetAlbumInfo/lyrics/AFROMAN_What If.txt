if god had long hair, and a go-t,
and if his eyes were pretty glazed,
and he looked spaced out would you buy his story,
would you believe he had an eye infection?

and yeah, yeah, god looks baked
and yeah, yeah, god smells good
and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
what is god smoked cannabis?
hit the bong like some of us,
drove a tie-die microbus, and he subscribes to rolling stones,

if god made this place in the begging and did he grow any seeds,
or did he put them there for Adam and Eve,
so they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was always offering

and yeah yeah god rolls great,
and yeah yeah god smells good,
and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
what if god smoked cannabis?
Do you suppose he had a buzz?
When he made the platypus,
he made it earth our home.
Does he like Perljam or the stones?
And do you think he rolls his own,
up there in heaven on the throne?
and when the saints go marching home,
maybe he sits and smokes a bone.
