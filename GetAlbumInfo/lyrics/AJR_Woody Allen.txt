Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Oh-oh-oh

Called you up so we could reminisce
About the old days, gold days,
How we've been.
The city's rusty after what we did.
We did, we did, we did.
Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records,
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store,
And now I'm shaking (shaking)
Waiting (waiting)
As you come say hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)

Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Oh-oh-oh

Every time I get the urge to go,
I'm the king of the island on a rusty throne.
Who the f--k wants to rule, ruling all alone, alone, alone, alone.
Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records,
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store,
And now I'm hoping (hoping)
Wishing (wishing)
As I walk you to your door (your door, your door, your door, your door)

Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Oh-oh-oh

And when the weekend comes around,
make our way through rusty towns.
Lift the weight up off your back,
You're with me, love, just relax.

Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Finally I'm right where I should be.

(Oh, Woah)
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot,
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know, now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen.
Oh-oh-oh
