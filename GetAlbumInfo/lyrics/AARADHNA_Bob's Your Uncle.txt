You think you sleep
Staying out at night
But you know damn right you is wrong

Youâre running all over town
While your man waits around
At home thinking that youâre with your girl

But he donât know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he donât know
That you out here doing him dirty
He donât know
Another man is giving his lady love
He donât know
Cause if he did heâd kick you out that door

You said Bobâs your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know youâre somebodyâs wife

Now what makes you think
That the birdies wonât sing?
About all of them secrets you hold
You ho-old
Whatever goes up
Must come back down
Shit like this always hits the ground

But he donât know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he donât know
That you out here doing him dirty
He donât know
Another man is giving his lady love
He donât know
Cause if he did heâd kick you out that door

You said Bobâs your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know youâre somebodyâs wife

So weâre talking
Up with the man and ask you
Who was your friend and you said
It was your uncle, it was your brother
It was your cousin

Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Bob is your uncle
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Bob is your uncle

You said Bobâs your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know youâre somebodyâs wife

Keep on, keep on telling them
Keep on, keep on telling them

Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Bob is your uncle
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Bob is your uncle
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Bob is your uncle
