A small town boy with a big time dream
Jimmy was a bonified rocking machine
He said one day I'm going to show the world
Exactly what I've got

He took a pull out sixteen and made a deal
For an iron horse and rocking steel
and then he hit the highway
He ain't turning back no more
Let it ride

First gear, he's off and running
Second gear, can you feel it coming
Catch the wind and ride, to heaven

Bright lights, big city
I've got a six-string up
So I'm down and dirty
I'm gonna rock a little bit
shake a little bit
Well I've got a dream and it just won't quit

Bright lights (bright lights), big city (big city)
And here I come and you better get ready
Cause moving up loving it feeling alive
Get on the world and ride
Gonna make it to the other side

Jackie was just a small town girl
When she really lived in another world
One where she was a queen just like you know her gene

So she packed her bags and she said goodbye
Little boy called Jimmy hitched a ride
and together they rode off to the thrills of Hollywood
Let it ride

First gear, they're off and running
Second gear, can you feel it coming
Catch the wind and ride, to heaven

Bright lights, big city
I'm heading out to the big time don't you worry
I cry a little bit, laugh a little bit
Cause we got a dream and it just won't quit

Bright lights (bright lights), big city (big city)
What we find might not be pretty
But we're moving up, loving it, feeling alive
Get on the world and ride to make it to the other side

Bright lights, bright lights, bright lights...

First gear, that's right
Catch the wind and ride, to heaven

Bright lights (bright lights), big city (big city)
What you find might not be pretty
So you cry a little bit, laugh a little bit
Only you got a dream you just don't quit

Bright lights (bright lights), big city (big city)
You gotta move like a freight train slow and steady
But you moving up, loving it, feeling alive
Get on the world and ride to make it to the other side

You got to find the bright lights
