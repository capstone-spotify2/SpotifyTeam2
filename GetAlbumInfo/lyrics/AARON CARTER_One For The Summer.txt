Hazy, crazy
Everyone is lazy
I wanna show the world how this could be amazing
Drinking lemonade with the sun looking down me
It's summertime and it's like the sea
We're checking around, got the sun-top down
The radio blearing at the best summer sound
In the palm of my hand, I got the sun, the sea
And the summer vibrations got a hold on me

One for the summertime
Everyone's got that summer vibe and
One for the summertime
'Cause it make's ya feel so good
Yeah, one for the summertime
Gonna party on all through the night
Just like everybody should

One for the summer
Yeah, one for summer
We're livin' it up real good, oh yeah
(Check it out, yeah)
One for the summer
Yeah, one for the summer
You gotta pump up your radio
Let's go, let's go
Come on

Here we go!

Hit this space, we're gonna cruise control
We're the world's eighth wonder and we're doing it all
Just checking out the crowd, I am precise and I
It' summertime, and were cool as ice
We're checking around, gonna hit the town
'Cause the party don't stop when the sun goes down
Flip flop, wanna see ya bop
'Cause it's one for the summer
And it just won't stop

One for the summertime
Everyone's got that summer vibe and
One for the summertime
'Cause it make's ya feel so good
Yeah, one for the summertime
Gonna party on all through the night
