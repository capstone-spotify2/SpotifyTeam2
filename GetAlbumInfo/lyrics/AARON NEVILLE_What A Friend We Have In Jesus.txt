What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer

Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never, never, never be discouraged, oh no
Take, take it to the Lord, to the Lord in prayer

Can we find a friend so faithful
Who with all our sorrows share?
Jesus know our every weakness
Take, take it to the Lord, to the Lord in prayer

Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior still our refuge
Take, take it to the Lord in prayer

Do your friends despise or forsake you?
Take it to the Lord, take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take you and shield you
You will find, you will find solace there
