Brand new Kakhi's on my ass,
Colt 45 in my glass...
Cadillac Coupe Deville,
Hit The Corner on three wheel.
I got my soundsystem beating real good,
Hittin switches while I'm throwin up the hood.
I never play the radio,
I buy underground from the mom-n-pappa sto'.
I cruise late night by the clubs,
Smokin on a dub while my woofers just sub.
Baby I'm from haddisburg,
Those are my Caddies up against the curb.
I got gold Daytona's on my car,
sport T-shirts, kakhi's and all stars.
I like regular people, not stars...
I don't play areas, just bars.

I don't act funny, I don't act funny,
just because I got some money... <i>[2x]</i>

I'm so glad I got my website,
I ain't worried bout mtv,

I'm so glad I got my website,
I ain't worried bout mtv,
I just got my hydraulics,

caddy hop baby, you don't stop...

The homies call me afroman,
I rap with a live funk band,
if you can't buy my music don't sweat,
order it of the internet.
I'm never on mtv, but everybody got my cd,
I'm never on the radio, but everybody knows afro.

make you caddy hop, at the red light,
don't trip, go ahead, that shit looks tight,
don't pass by the homies, unless you hit the switches,
don't have hydraulics, and act like a bitch!
when you hit the switches get your shine on,
think about the days, you got your grind on.
smokin that weed, drinkin that brew,
you like the lowrider? I like the lowrider too!
