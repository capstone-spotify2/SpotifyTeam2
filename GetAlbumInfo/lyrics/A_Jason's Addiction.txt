Pretty scary how they know you, it depends who you talk to
From the end to the beginning, only happy when we're singing

Smiling for the camera, crazy silly monsters, they think everything is great
Black and white not colour, eight times ten, no bigger, not tonight it ain't

You can try and put the face on, you can talk but it all goes wrong
You can put it in an album, like the "90's never happened"

Everything is easy, but they don't believe me, I think I deserve a say
Beds are made for sharing, but I'm way past caring, not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't

<i>[Break]</i>

Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't

Trying to remember, nothing lasts forever, live it before it gets too late
On the never ever, pretty good together, not tonight it aint
