Heard all the stories 'bout this life
None of 'em for me, not that type

I wanna run with the wolves in the wild
We can go and we'll race right through the night
There's no fear in my eyes, just the will to survive
No, we'll never stop the fight

Give me a dream and I'll chase it
Lend me your heart and I'll break it
Show me the world and I'll take it
Baby, I won't quit 'cause I'm a firestorm
I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
Show me the world and I'll take it
Baby, I won't quit 'cause I'm a firestorm

See all the glory, feel the call
Nothing can stop me, I need it all

I wanna run with the wolves in the wild
We can go and we'll race right through the night
There's no fear in my eyes, just the will to survive
No, we'll never stop the fight

Give me a dream and I'll chase it
Lend me your heart and I'll break it
Show me the world and I'll take it
Baby, I won't quit 'cause I'm a firestorm
I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
Show me the world and I'll take it
Baby, I won't quit 'cause I'm a firestorm

I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
I'm a firestorm, I'm a firestorm
