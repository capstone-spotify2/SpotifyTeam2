Hey, hello
I am another wasted mind and soul
I am another waste of thought in space and time
But on the brighter side my problems seem to rhyme

Iâll say what I mean
This lonely life of I and me is all I need
Some things things will come and go
Iâll take this ride
This lonely life of me and I
thatâs just fine
Some things just come and go
Some things just come and go

As I take a look at my life right now
Iâm surprised to find Iâve got no friends to let me down
You could read it on my face just an hour ago
It was just another missed chance here to get up and go
I let myself down again (down again)

Iâll say what I mean
This lonely life of I and me is all I need
Some things things will come and go
Iâll take this ride
This lonely life of me and I
Thatâs just fine
Some things just come and go
(Some things just come and go)
Some things just come and go
(Some things just come and go)

They come and go...

I remember every choice Iâve made
and I donât regret them
I remember every day I waste
and I donât regret them

Iâll say what I mean
this lonely life of I and me is all I need
Some things things will come and go
Iâll take this ride
This lonely life of me and I
Thatâs just fine
Some things just come and go
Some things just come and go
