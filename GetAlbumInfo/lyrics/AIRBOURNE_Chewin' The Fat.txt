Her loving is wild her loving is sweet 
Like candy to a child, she knows just what I need 
With love and pain, she left me red and raw 
I was achin' for days now I'm back at your door 
Back for more back for more 

Chewin' the fat

Baby you know where it's at

Keep on chewing the fat 
Yeah yeah 
Honey you know where it's at tonight 

Satisfaction, treats me like a king 
She's my little princess, for her I'd do anything 
Now I gotta say goodbye, time to hit the road 
But next week she'll be mine to help me loosen that load 
To loosen that load, don't you know
