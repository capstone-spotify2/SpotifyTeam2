Like a killer at large
You strolled down Bourbon Street
Lookin' for an easy mark
With every man you meet
And I never saw the devil
Behind your rain blue eyes
Spellbound by your long legs and your little white lies

Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you

You're no Adalida, no pretty Cajun queen
Just a bad girl from Biloxi, more addicting than morphine
And when your love wears off
There's nothin' left but pain
And enough teardrops fall to flood Lake Ponchatrain

Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you

I can see you smilin' in some Creole cafe
Slippin' your love potion in someone's ettouffe

Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you

Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
