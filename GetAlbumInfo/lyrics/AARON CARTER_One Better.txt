Give me half the chance
Iâll make you understand
That what I got to give
Is so much more than this 
Than you'll ever know

I donât say whatâs on my mind
But youâll find this out in time
Donât always open up
Iâm not quick to trust
And let someone inside

Iâve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say whatâs right for me

You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need
Iâll show you something new to see, yeah
Iâll be the one you can believe
Iâll be one better, Yeah
Iâll be one better

Youâve seen some falling stars
You felt a broken heart
Time is all it takes 
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are
But I canât hang on the side
Iâve had enough of all these fights
Gotta give to you
Gotta get this through

Till you realize
Iâve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say whatâs right for me

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
Iâll show you something new to see (yeah)
Iâll be the one you can believe
Iâll be one better, Yeah

I wont back down (No never, No never)
You donât have to be alone 
Girl, Alone (Oooh, Ooh) No (Oh)

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
Iâll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
Iâll be one better (Oh)
(Iâll be)
Iâll be one better (Oh)
(Iâll will)
Iâll be one better (Oh)
