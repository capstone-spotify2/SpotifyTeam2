<i>[George:]</i> Yeah, this town is going under!

The temperature's through the floor
Your fingers are turning black.
There's a crisis knocking at your door!
(One nine seven seven, one nine seven seven)

You'd better try to make it home.
The snow is getting too deep to drive.
Your car might be your coffin.
(One nine seven seven, one nine seven seven)

We're never going to see the summer
This season's coming long and hard.
Yeah, this town is going under.
This season's going to kill us all.

Count the snow flakes, little children.
Count them as they bury you alive.
Count them as they choke the road ways.
A blizzard's coming in the year punk died.
(One nine seven seven)

This season's left us all helpless.
I can't see and even God is blind
And deaf to all your prayers.
(One nine seven seven, one nine seven seven.)

There's nothing that you can do.
This weather's stronger than us all.
The sky is going to crush you.
(One nine seven seven, one nine seven seven)

<i>[Dallas:]</i> This season's growing cold,
I fear that this could be the end.
And there's no sign of hope.
We've got a crisis on our hands.

<i>[George:]</i> The junkie is trapped indoors.
Pretty soon he's going to need a fix,
But the weather's not going to let him,
And he's starting to get the itch.

This season's holding us all hostage,
Better do whatever it demands.
Carter knows that we've got a crisis
Weighing on our frost bitten hands. 

(ONE!)
There's nothing that you can do.
The sky is going to crush you.
(NINE!)
There's nothing that you can do.
The sky is going to crush you.
(SEVEN!)
There's nothing that you can do.
The sky is going to crush you.
(SEVEN!)
There's nothing that you can do.
The sky is going to crush you.

<i>[Dallas:]</i> This season's growing cold,
I fear that this could be the end.
And there's no sign of hope.
We've got a crisis on our hands.
