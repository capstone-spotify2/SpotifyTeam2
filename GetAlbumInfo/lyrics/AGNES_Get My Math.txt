Step in the club with my girls like what 
Lookin' so tight and you know what's up 
I meet your eyes and yours meet mine 
Thinking this might be your time 

Ecstatic, dramatic 
I need you like an addict 
Come on and jump on 
And make sure that your game is tight 

Work it, try a little harder 
Spit it, if you wanna roll babe 
Twirk it, you might get my math from me 
Work it, try a little harder 
Spit it, if you wanna roll babe 
Twirk it, you might get my math from me 

You're doing what a real man should 
The way you move it feels so good 
Attraction boy it's plain to see 
Come on baby rock with me oh yea 

Ecstatic, dramatic 
I need you like an addict 
Come on and jump on 
And make sure that your game is tight 

Work it, try a little harder 
Spit it, if you wanna roll babe 
Twirk it, you might get my math from me 
Work it, try a little harder 
Spit it, if you wanna roll babe 
Twirk it, you might get my math from me 

If you wanna step to me 
If you wanna get next to me 
If you wanna step to me 
Make sure that your game is tight 

Ecstatic, dramatic 
I need you like an addict 
Come on and jump on 
And make sure that your game us tight 

Work it, try a little harder 
Spit it, if you wanna roll babe 
Twirk it, you might get my math from me
