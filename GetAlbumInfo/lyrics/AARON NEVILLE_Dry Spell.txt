If it was for me,
I thought it would come so easy.
Never realized, life's just a series of lows and highs.
I just want to create, it doesn't matter how I do it.
Nobody ever said that's there's nothing to it.

Goosebumps been gone, for way to long.

Couldn't get it for free, couldn't do it for the money.
It just disappeared, spent a lot of bearin' years.
And if it doesn't work out, you can just set it down for later.
Nobody ever said you'd be dead forever.

Goosebumps been gone, for way to long.
Who knows how long, they'll stick around.

If it was for me, I thought it would come so easy.
Never realized, life's just a series of lows and highs.
Couldn't get it for free, didn't wanna have to try and do it.
Nobody ever said, that there's nothing to it.

Goosebumps been gone, for way to long
Who knows how long, they'll stick around
Goosebumps been gone, for way to long
Who knows how long, they'll stick around

Please stick around.
