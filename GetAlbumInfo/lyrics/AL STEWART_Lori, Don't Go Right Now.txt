Lori, don't go right now
Now that you've come this far
Lori, you don't know how
Close you really are.

There's nothing you can't do
It's up to you to let it go
Put the past behind
Out of sight and out of mind.

Lori, you're never gonna see
Behind the untried door
You know it doesn't have to be
The way it was before.

You're not the only one who found too soon
The more you care
The more you stand to lose
I've been inside your shoes
So Lori, don't go right now.

I know you just take anything on trust
Why don't you open up and show the way you feel?
What's there to hide?
What is it that's inside of you that you seem so unwilling to reveal?

So let's just take it slow
It's not as though
I'm asking for your secrets or your soul
You need a hand to hold
So Lori, don't go right now.

Lori, don't go right now
Lori, don't go right now.
