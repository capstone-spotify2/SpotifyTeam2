Young girl in a darkened room, crying all alone
Forced upon by her captors, so far from her home
While in another country, a rich man counts his take
He cares not for the lifes he ruins
Why can't we make a world where there's

No more... Human trafficking
No more... Hunger and lies
No more... Crime and poverty

If we would heed the cries and unbind the ties
We all wanna be free
Break the barricades, open prison gates
We all wanna be free
Tear down the wall, we want it all
We all wanna be free
If we all stand together... We're all gonna be free

In the scums of LA, a man with a habbit dies
Needle still hanging in his arms
Nobody cares of cries
And in a foreign country, a rich man counts his take
No remorse for the life he ruins
Why can't we make a world where there's

No more... Gangs murdering
No more... Pushers and lies
No more... Crime and poverty

If we could heed the cries and rebind the ties
We all wanna be free
Break the barricades, open prison gates
We all wanna be free
Tear down the wall, we want it all
We all wanna be free
If we all stand together... We're all gonna be free
