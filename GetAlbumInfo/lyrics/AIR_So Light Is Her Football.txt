So light is her footfall
She walks like a bird
She's an angel
Such a familiar stranger
I wish I could help her
She's in danger
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone
All alone alone alone alone
So light is her footfall
She moves like a ghost
And I lost her
In the mist of dawn
She's already gone
And I miss her
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone
All alone alone alone alone
And I miss her
And I miss her
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone
All alone alone alone alone
So light was her footfall
So light was her footfall
So light was her footfall
So light was her footfall
