Wish I knew
Why I'm so in love with you
No one else in this world will do
Darling, please save your love for me
Run away
If I were wise I'd run away
But like a fool in love I stay
And pray you'll save your love for me.

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you my dear
And though I know no good
Can come from loving you

I can't do a thing,
I'm so in love with you.
So darling , help me please
Have mercy on a
Fool like me
I'm so unwise but still I plead
Darling, please save your love
For me.

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you dear
And though I know no good
Can come from loving you

I can't
Help myself, oh what will I do.
So darling, help me please
Mercy
I know I'm wrong but still I plead
That you will save your love for me
Go ahead,
Have fun in a crowd
But for crying out loud
Darling, please save your love
For me
