Yo my fault man, my fault

One of the few dogs that pulled through the Mike Vick fiasco
Heart of a lion with the strength, straight outta Glasgow
Pudzianowski, known to let the guns loose
Everybody smoking cigarettes in jump suits
Kosovo to the basement of your building
Terrible dentistry, gold in every filling
Cut âem a deal bet they let you bring the crills in(?)
No English, kill mad kitchen knives concealed in
The staircase is where we earn the degree
The lawsuits on the fine flesh feeding the fiend
Light Caesar-covered skull
Eyes are like the ocean blue
Stay fly, rock Elvis, thatâs emotional
Nice shirt, crazy hat, mean jacket
Orange drugs if youâre reppinâ for the team clappinâ
With the capillaries, big gun, Tackleberry
Tell the preacher at the chapel get the casket ready
Two sevenâs hit the third one on the river
Chicken liver dinner have your Jewish mother sitting shiva
âCause the kid was a putz
Hit the clutch, spin the tires âtil they smoke disappear into the dust, uh
Dive in the muff break the pussy like an Asian cookie
You the type to shave your face to make your anus bushy
Tie a knot in your shirt right by your stomach
You make me wanna vomit, steady getting blunted
The diesel sweet and sour, the blunt vanilla
Twist it to perfection, gentle hands, still a guerrilla
Iâm at the villa, â97 Dâelegance
The Pelican Brief, you rapping with irrelevance
Hard to kill, call me Mason Storm
Your basic elevate my skills to the type of shit that Gracieâs on
Omaplata, guard your nose, Haloti Ngata
Total knocker, seldom sipping Stoli Vodka
Making maneuvers for myself out on a late night
The year been great right? Trying to get the plate right
âCause Iâm a hunter like a great white
And a performer, never stage fright
Iâm outta Flushing, Queens
Shoot your gun if you love the smell of money
Love the taste of good weed, vintage in your tummy
Love a bitch with good puss digginâ in her bunny
Peace to gettinâ money, peace to gettinâ money

Yeah, Flushing, Queens. Outdoorsmen shit
Yeah, Action Statik Selektah shit
Kill yourself now
