Oh yeah, babe yeah yeah yea

What I wouldn't give to
Wrestle over the remote control
What I wouldn't give to
Hit you harder than you thought I could
With the pillow
Can we stop just for a second
Cause you got a feather in your eye
I get it out and you kiss me, I smile
And then we get back to our pillow fight
Man, that sounds nice, ooh

If the sky began to fall
We wouldn't even notice
Really wouldn't bother us at all
If the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two
When I'm laying around with you
When I'm laying around with you
What I wouldn't give to

What I wouldn't give to
Cook you dinner from the microwave
What I wouldn't give to
Burn the popcorn
And hear you tell me "Baby that's OK"
(Baby that's OK)

And then you leave to go to the store
And it's almost too much for me
Though I know it'll only be a minute
And then you come back through the door
With a bagful of all the foods
That we're not supposed to eat
That's the night that can't be beat, ooh

If the sky began to fall
We wouldn't even notice
Really wouldn't bother us at all
If the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two
When I'm laying around with you
When I'm laying around with you
What I wouldn't give to

I wanna be in your arms
Where no harm
Could ever come my way
I wanna be where you are
Though near or far
Every night and day, ooh

If the sky began to fall
We wouldn't even notice
Really wouldn't bother us at all
If the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two
When I'm laying around with you
When I'm laying around with you

If the sky began to fall
We wouldn't even notice
Really wouldn't bother us at all
If the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two
When I'm laying around with you
When I'm laying around with you
Ooh, when I'm laying around with you
Ooh oh, when I'm laying around with you
