I love your pussy

Hey boy, you know when I first met you
I knew that you were special that night
You had a little somethin' different
So warm and so sweet and so right
Haters will hate what we can create
But I wouldn't change a single thing on you today

I love your pussy, I think you're pretty
I love your pussy, don't you?
I love your pussy, if you were with me
I would be so good to you

La la la la la la la <i>[x3]</i>
I love your pussy

Whisper sweetly in my ear
Eat pizza, watch Golden Girls
We fit so perfectly together
You opened up my whole wide world

Sometimes people are crazy
Sometimes people are mean
But as long as you're you
And as long as I'm me
Then that's all that we need to be

<i>[Spoken:]</i>
I don't care if you're a boy who used to be a girl
Or a girl who used to be a boy
All I care about is you right now
Cause aren't we all just something a little bit inbetween?
I love hearts, not parts

Sometimes people are crazy
Sometimes people are mean
But as long as you're you
And as long as I'm me
Then that's all that we need to be

La la la la la la la <i>[x3]</i>
I love your pussy
