I used to be so mean to myself
I am my own worst enemy
I used to hide my truth
From you
I can't remember what it feels like
To come out of hiding
I-I-I-I'm ready

Coming out of the shadows like I'm enough
Loving every bit of the real I got
Every inch of my messy is beautiful
Something truly courageous in showing up
Singing
I-I-I-I'm showing up

I've never measured up
To my rules
My little, careful calculations
They shattered at the sight
Of my roof
That every thought could be loved by
You-ou-ou-ou
I'm not afraid now
I-I-I-I'm...

Coming out of the shadows like I'm enough
Loving every bit of the real I got
Every inch of my messy is beautiful
Something truly courageous in showing up
Singing
I-I-I-I'm showing up

No more believing I'm gonna need a little more than I got
Done over thinking every reason I gotta sit and watch
<i>[x3]</i>

Coming out of the shadows like I'm enough
Loving every bit of the real I got
Every inch of my messy is beautiful
Something truly courageous in showing up
Singing
Oo-oo-oo-oo I'm ready
I-I-I-I'm showing up
