You donât remember me, but I remember you.
It was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two.

Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.

If we could start anew I wouldnât hesitate
Iâd gladly take you back and temper hand of fate.

Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.

Longest, I will catch you,
And longest night of talk.
When you found the one you love
She filled your heart with joy.

Oh, we could start anew
I wouldnât hesitate.
I could gladly take you back
And temper hand of fate.

Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.

You donât remember me,
I remember you
Like it was just yesterday,
I remember you
Cause you played me for a fool.
