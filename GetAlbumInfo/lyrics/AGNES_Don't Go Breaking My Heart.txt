Calling your name
Calling your name
How did this happen?

I'm losing my way
Think I'm going insane, I don't understand it, no
The water runs deep, and it's taken me
It's taken me so far away
Walls caving in, I'm giving in
Cause we're taking it all the way

I can't stop this now, noo
Cause my world revolves 'round you
My defense is down, yeaah
And there's nothing I can do

So Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My (My My) Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heaaaart

Baby it's you, baby it's you
You got me hopeless
I'm losing my grip, what can I do
You know I can't focus, no
The water runs deep, and it's taken me
It's taken me so far away
Walls caving in, I'm giving in
Cause we're taking it all the way

I can't stop this now, noo
Cause my world revolves 'round you
My defense is down, yeaah
And there's nothing I can do

So Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My (My My) Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heaaaart

I know it's hard, I felt the pain
Let's take a chance and start again
I'm in the deep, I'm calling out
Oh can't you hear, hear me now?
Don't break my heart...
Don't break my heart...

I can't stop this now, noo
Cause my world revolves 'round you
My defense is down (my defense is down), yeaah
And there's nothing I can do

So Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My (My My) Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
Don't Go Breaking My Heaaaart
