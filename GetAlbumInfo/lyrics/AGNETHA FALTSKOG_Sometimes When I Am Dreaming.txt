All the friends I believed in
I believed in for a while
They had their flair 
They had their style
But nobody quite got it right 
Nobody knew just how it feels to be me

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I meet someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze
It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real 
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

And it's now
That I need a friend
I reach out for the phone 
Nobody's there Nobody's home
Though it may not be right to give up the fight 
I'm sailing away 
Now I'm on my own
Alone

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I meet someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze
It's only when I'm dreaming that I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming
