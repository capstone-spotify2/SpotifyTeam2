Wrong track, wrong line
Fast train never run on time
Bad blood, bad news
Hangin' by a rope got nothin' to lose
Mad bull, see red
Comin' at me happy when I'm dead
Jump fence, got away
Ain't got a likin' for the games he play
What ya gonna do
Everybody tryin' to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by
Saved in the nick in time
I was saved in the nick

Slow plane, hard rain
Cold sweat and he show the strain
Look down, no ground
Black sky just the engine sound
Bail out, goodbye
Take my chances I don't wanna die
Count 10, just pray
The nick of time can save me any day
What ya gonna do
Everybody love a hero honey
Livin' on the danger line
Saved by
Saved in the nick in time
Saved in the nick in time

Loose sleep, get grief
Short day an' gettin' no relief
Quick punch, closed eye
You didn't do it you wonder why
Lynch mob, on your tail
Think they were searchin' for the holy grail
Leave town, got away
I didn't figure on them anyway
No I didn't
Everybody tryin' to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by
Saved in the nick in time
In the nick of time
In the nick of time

I was saved in the nick of time
