If I ever touched a hundred million dollars in my life oh lord knows (lord knows lord knows)
That's my motha fuckin' goals (my goals my goals)
That's my motha fuckin' goals (my goals my goals)
All I ever really wanted was to take care of the family and my woes
(my people my folks)
And my motha fuckin goals (my goals my goals)
That's my motha fuckin goals (my goals my goals)
I need a bitch that fuck with me and roll the weed and suck the D when I get home (hell yeah)
No complainin' bout other hoes (Don't talk about it)
That's my motha fuckin goals (my goals my goals)
And I'd rather never sell another, I would never have to sell my soul (never that)
And my motha fuckin goal (my goal my goal)
And my motha fuckin goal (my goal my goal)

We on with the roof fame
Big money on the wrist game
Little nigga with a big dream
I remember them days in the hoop day
I'm in that new thang with a few chains
'nd I swish champagne for duke's sake
4, 5 later kickin like lukain
Small city young nigga tryin to maintain
And I had no pot to piss in
My daddy missin
Guess god was listenin
I remember them days of wishin
Nobody listen
Had to show 'em once again
How I get my checks with two commas
Did everythang that I promised
Want better health for my momma
And lean yo tea from you hina
And that's my motha fuckin goal
Tellem free my motha fuckin woes
Every king need a queen to touch his soul
Baby keep on ballin' on them hoes
And I still got so far to go
And I still got so much to do
One thing I won't do is lose
I know
They know
We know

And I want that mansion in the hills
Big faces on the bills
I touch the money, I seen a million, I can tell you how it feel
Put both my children on the will
I'll never be nothin less I'm trill
Lord knows it's complicated, got confrontation, with the baby momma still
But I got that love for you baby
All them times you tried to play me
Perfect time, mindin my mind, ridden and I found a better lady
I'm so blessed I need a halo
Fuck you if you hatin on me
I just want to put all my niggas in the position for the baaank roll
On my list of many goals
I'm so gifted with the flow
Drink champagne out the bottle
That's my one and only motto
No I grind, 'nd I pray
Do it all again tomorrow
For my son and my little daughter and my momma heavenly father

I'm all on Instagram flexin
Chocolate Sunday is her obsession
I got habits of countin' blessings
I'm a student to every lesson
Only others the way to go
Never talk to much on them phones
Never forget bout where you come from
Broward County you been puttin on
That's been my motha fuckin' goal
Now a young nigga puttin on
And this my motha fuckin song
And this my motha fucking song
