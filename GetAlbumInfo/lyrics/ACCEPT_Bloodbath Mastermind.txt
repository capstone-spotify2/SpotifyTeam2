Lurking in darkness where no one may go
Hatred breeds in your mind
Consciously heartless, blood running cold
Your evils begun to unwind

Lost in confusion your plotting unfolds
Madness starts to take shade
Explosions and shootings, out of control
The innocent run to escape

When all that we care for has gone up in smoke
A burnt out horizon remains
The last things heard were the curses you spoke
And the shots that took you away

You're the antimatter, bloodbath mastermind
Human antimatter, bloodbath mastermind

No one can say why you've taken this path
Murder has become your creed
Or how you became this psychopath
Spawn of the seed

The depth of your sickness could not be contained
It's now just a story we'll tell
All we can hope for is that justice be paid
And you serve your sentence in Hell

You're the antimatter, bloodbath mastermind
Human antimatter, bloodbath mastermind

We seek retribution for the crimes
But you have taken that away
You chose a cowards suicide
Could be we're better off this way You're the antimatter
