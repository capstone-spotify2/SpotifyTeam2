In the quiet of a shadow 
In the corner of a room 
Darkness moves upon you 
Like a cloud across the moon 

You're aware in all the silence 
Of a constant that will turn 
Like the windmill left deserted 
Or the sun forever burn 

So don't forget to breathe 
Don't forget to breathe 
Your whole life is here 
No eleventh hour reprieve 
So don't forget to breathe 

Keep your head above water 
But don't forget to breathe 

And all the suffering that you've witnessed 
And the hand prints on the wall 
They remind you how it's endless 
How endlessly you fall 

Then the answer that you're seeking 
For the question that you found 
Drives you further to confusion 
As you lose your sense of ground 

So don't forget to breathe 
Don't forget to breathe 
Your whole life is here 
No eleventh hour reprieve 
So don't forget to breathe 

Keep your head above water 
But don't forget to breathe 

Breathe...

Don't forget to breathe 
Don't forget to breathe 
You know you are here 
But you find you want to leave 
So don't forget to... breathe 

Just breathe...
Just breathe...
Just breathe... 
Just breathe... 
Just breathe...
