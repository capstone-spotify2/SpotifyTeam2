<i>[Alan Jackson]</i>
Girl I swear you got me acting crazy
Half the time I don't know what my name is
I'm the kind that like to take it slow and lazy
And girl you got me running hot and haziest

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

<i>[Martina McBride]</i>
Boy you got me burning like a rocket
You stole my heart and stuck it in your pocket
Now I got your face inside my locket
I've really tried but I don't think I can stop it baby

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh I, love you like I never
Oh I, love you like I never
Oh I, love you like I never loved before

<i>[Alan Jackson]</i>
You sat beside me last night on the sofa
I took your hand and pulled you little closer
You kiss my lips and then you let me hold you
That feels the way that love supposed to baby

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

<i>[Martina McBride]</i>
You held the door when we went to the movies
I like your corky sneaky sense of humor
You're strong and sweat and all the things I needed
You're the one that keeps my heart beating baby

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

<i>[Martina McBride]</i>
Oh, my heart stops beating
When it's time for you to leave me

<i>[Alan Jackson]</i>
Yeah, and my head starts spinning
Every time that you are near me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before
