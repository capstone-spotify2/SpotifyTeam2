<i>[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
I'm a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, I'm the pro-to-pane
Niggas sizing me up like I'm buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease 'em, iron 'em up
With the nina, not talking 'bout the two singers
Cause a leprechaun wouldn't even press his luck
I'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what, can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low like a silencer

<i>[Bridge - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

<i>[Hook - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

<i>[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Back to the realist shit, niggas ain't raw
You grilling, I'mma menage a woman and I
Barrage, be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, ya baby momma
Brain is crazy: Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust: conquer
Chocolate seats: Willy Wonka
Passenger: Pretty Woman
Directed back, bring ya compass
You bringing Carson, you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense, we bring the real
Like pro tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blankas
Bonkers, tell 'em Top Dawg is here!

<i>[Bridge - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

<i>[Hook - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

<i>[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
I think it's that give us that back
Whatever war you bring, send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, lowkey, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like an oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opi
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-Z
We running the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

<i>[Bridge - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

<i>[Hook - Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!
