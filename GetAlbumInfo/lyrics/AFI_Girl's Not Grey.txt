I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art does drown

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued?
(What follows) has led me to this place
where I belong, with all erased
What follows

All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued?
(What follows) has led me to this place
where I belong, with all erased

I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground

I'll lay me down, I'll lay me down

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued?
(What follows) has led me to this place
where I belong, with all erased

What follows will swallow whole
What follows will swallow whole
