<i>[Ben]</i>
Maybe I don't even exist
So I'll stay anonymous
It's over and the situation shouted in shame
And they say it's down to us
But what do they know
<i>[All]</i>
So write, this time
Till it's starting or ending
I'll never get tired of your lies

<i>[Ben]</i>
But what you've got to visualize
<i>[All]</i>
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
<i>[Ben]</i>
Either get it high or go dry
This time

<i>[Paul]</i>
I see you're playing that song again
You never show your hand 
To let me in

<i>[Paul]</i>
You keep it all inside yourself
And cry to no one else
But I catch your tears

<i>[All]</i>
So I write
<i>[Ben]</i>
So I write,this time
This time

Till it's starting or ending (<i>[Ben:]</i> starting)
I'll never get tired of your lies

<i>[Paul]</i>
But what you've got to visualize (<i>[Ben:]</i> oh, oh)
<i>[All]</i>
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry
<i>[Paul]</i>
Either get it high or go dry

<i>[Mark]</i>
You say this love will see another day
But at least tonight
You'll be mine

<i>[All]</i>
So I write (<i>[Mark:]</i> so I write), this time (<i>[Mark:]</i> this time)
Till it's starting or ending (<i>[Mark:]</i> starting or ending)
I'll never get tired of your lies (<i>[Mark:]</i> oh, oh)

<i>[Paul]</i>
But what you've got to visualize
<i>[All]</i>
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry

<i>[Ben]</i>
Gonna go, gonna go
Gonna go high or get dry
Yeah, yeah (<i>[All:]</i> either get it high or go dry)
We either (<i>[All:]</i> go dry)

(<i>[Paul:]</i> high and dry)
(<i>[Ben:]</i> no...) either get it high or go dry
(<i>[Paul:]</i> high and dry)
(<i>[Ben:]</i> we either go)
(<i>[Mark:]</i> high or dry) (<i>[Ben:]</i> no...)
So I write (<i>[Ben:]</i> this time, baby, this time
