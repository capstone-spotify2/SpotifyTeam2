I.. (my my my my)
I can turn a gray sky blue (you see) 
I can make it rain when I want it to 
I can build a castle from a single grain of sand (you see) 
I can make a ship sail on dry land (children, yeah) 

Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess 
Girl, you're the key to my happiness 
And I...

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Oh Lord
(Can't get next to you) 
I've been trying a long time 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
(Can't get next to you)
I don't know what to do 

(Let me say) 
I.. (my my my my my)
I can fly like the bird in the sky 
I can buy anything that money can buy 
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess 
Girl, you're the key, 'cause

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Baby
(Can't get next to you) 
I've been trying a long time 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
(Can't get next to you)

(Let me tell you that) 
I can turn back the hands of time 
(You better believe I can... you see)
I can make the seasons change 
Just by waving my hand (let me say) 
I can change anything from old to new (girl)
All the things I want to do the most (you see)
I'm unable to do 

Unimportant are all these things
That I'm trying to do here today day
Girl, you see, I...

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
I've been trying a long time
(Can't get next to you) 
Somebody oughta help me 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Let me, let me go
(Can't get next to you)
Let me!

Lord, I've been working on it, baby 
I've been thinking about it
You see, I've been trying to call you all day long
But, you see, I don't have your phone number, honey 
I've been thinking about you baby, something awful 
Sometime I feel like I want to moan about it 
And I just don't know what to say 
And I say..
