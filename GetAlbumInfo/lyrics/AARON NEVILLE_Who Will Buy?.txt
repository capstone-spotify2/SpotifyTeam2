Who will buy this wonderful morning?
Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon?
And put it in a box for me

So I could see it at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And keep it as a treasure
To last my whole life long

Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep this sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy

Who will buy this wonderful morning...?
There'll never be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is the man with all the money?
It's cheap at half the price

Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep the sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy
