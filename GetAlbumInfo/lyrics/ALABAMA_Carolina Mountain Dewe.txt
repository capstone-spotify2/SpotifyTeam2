Somewhere in the mountains, in northern Alabama
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee
And somewhere in a motel out in Oklahoma
There's the Alabama dreamer, that same man from Tennessee

Sometime late at night the lonely wakes her gently
And knocks at her door but she won't give in
But like every other woman she needs to feel wanted
She thinks of making love and goes to sleep again

Carolina, dreamin' lonely, Carolina, can't you see
You will always be the lady that I dream of holding tight
That I kiss and tell goodnight, Carolina Mountain Dewe

Sometime that next day on a Mississippi freeway
The Alabama dreamer is homeward bound
His conscious is as clear as those green eyes of Carolina
And she's waiting with the baby from the love
Of the only man to lay her down

Carolina, dreamin' lonely, Carolina, can't you see
You will always be the lady that I dream of holding tight
That I kiss and tell goodnight, Carolina Mountain Dewe

Carolina, I love you
