Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all.
Let me remember the things I've done:
Walk on the log where the catfish bite;
Walking along the river road at night;
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight.

I can hear the bullfrog calling me.
Wond'rin' if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.
Ole Brody Juniour took me over;
Said, You're gonna find a well that's colder.
If I'm a bad boss, give some ol' Green River.

Well..
