Frozen fingers on a coco wheel
Hot emotions that you can't conceal
Stay on the freeway
Take the chance of your life

Screamin' sirens cryin' in your ear
Flashin' red lights burnin' in tthe mirror
Come on step on it
Get them out of your sight

Can't be too cool, when you're dancin' with DANGER
Don't play the fool, when you're dancin' with DANGER

Runnin' lonely and your out of steam
Silent madness when you try to speak
Shattered pictures
Of a face you once knew

Can't be too cool, when you're dancin' with DANGER
Don't play the fool, when you're dancin' with DANGER

Can't be too cool, when you're dancin' with DANGER
Don't play the fool, when you're dancin' with DANGER
