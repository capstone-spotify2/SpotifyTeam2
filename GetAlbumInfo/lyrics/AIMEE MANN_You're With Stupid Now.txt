I don't know how to break the news, but
It's pretty clear you'll be asked to choose between
What you lack and what you excuse
In this tug of war
You can't say that they didn't warn you
Though you'd rather that they just ignore you
Cause your devices are not working for you anymore

What you want, you don't know
You're with stupid now

You don't know how to manufacture
Sturdy bones with a hairline fracture
The crazy will of a Margaret Thatcher
That they've all got
Though you pay for the hands they're shaking
The speeches and the mistakes they're making
As they struggle with the undertaking
Of simple thought

What you want, you don't know
You're with stupid now
What you know, you don't want to know
You're with stupid now

What you want, you don't know
You're with stupid now
What you know, you don't want to know
You're with stupid now

So on with the show
