Through the wildest waters and in the 
Highest flame You are standing with me
Youâre never gonna let me go
In the heat of battle, encircled by 
My foe Iâll just keep on dancing
Youâre never gonna let me go 
Youâre never gonna let me go I know,
Youâre never gonna let me go
No powâr on earth can break Your hold
Youâre never gonna let me go

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go

What can separate me 
When You are holding on?
Even death wonât take me
Youâre never gonna let me go 
I said even death wonât take me
Youâre never gonna let me go 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go

Because of the Cross the grave has lost its sting
Because of the Cross, You shamed our enemy
Nothing is lost that cannot be redeemed
Because of the Cross, we stand in victory
<i>[x2]</i>

Youâre never gonna let me go I know
Youâre never gonna let me go
No powâr on earth can break Your hold
Youâre never gonna let me go
Youâre never gonna let me go
I know Youâre never gonna let me go
No powâr on earth can break Your hold
Youâre never gonna let me go

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go
You wonât let go
Youâre never gonna let me go
