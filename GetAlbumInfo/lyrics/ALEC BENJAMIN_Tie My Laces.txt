Just a young boy
At the starting line with his tunes on
And his shoes untied with a chip on
His shoulder side from what he tripped on
The last time he's Buzz Lightyear
With no hyper-drive
He's like Mike here
With no Nike Flight and he'll fall down
With his shoes untied
And he'll trip on to the finish line

And I'll try to write this song
If he gets there
And I want to write this song

I'd like to be the one who is on the podium
Take a photo for my mom
And show here that I've made it
I'd like to be the one who could write the perfect song
Just to show you that I've won
But I'll have to tie my laces
If I'm gonna make it

In that moment
When they hit the lights in looked golden
But it didn't feel right he was frozen
With the worst frostbite was he chosen
Like an Israelite, pick the quotient
That you can't divide like two oceans
Stranded on the other side his devotions
On the other side his emotions
On the other side

And I'll try to write this song
If he gets there
And I want to write this song

I'd like to be the one who is on the podium
Take a photo for my mom
And show here that I've made it
I'd like to be the one who could write the perfect song
Just to show you that I've won
But I'll have to tie my laces
If I'm gonna make it

And then I'll end this song
In 2051
And sing it for my son
And then I'll tie his laces
Just a young boy at the starting line, line, line, line

I'd like to be the one who is on the podium
Take a photo for my mom
And show here that I've made it
I'd like to be the one who could write the perfect song
Just to show you that I've won
But I'll have to tie my laces
If I'm gonna make it

Just a young boy at the starting line
