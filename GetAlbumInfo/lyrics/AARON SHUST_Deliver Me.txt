Deliver me
As I call upon Your name
Be the God who breaks my chains
All the shackles of my shame

Deliver me
From the lies that wreck my heart
Come and lead me from the dark
Father show how strong You are
Deliver me
Oh Lord deliver me

Oh and I will trust in only You
For You will bring the victory
You will bring the victory
All your promises are true
It doesn't matter what I see
It doesn't matter what I see

Deliver me
Even when I am afraid
When the world around me shakes
I know You will never change

Deliver me
Oh Lord deliver me

Oh and I will trust in only You
For You will bring the victory
You will bring the victory
All your promises are true
It doesn't matter what I see
It doesn't matter what I see

Deliver me
Into Your hands I will surrender all
Take it all
Oh let my life bring You praise
With all I am I worship all You are
For Your are
My only refuge and strength
Oh Deliver me

Deliver me
Into Your hands I will surrender all
Take it all
Oh let my life bring You praise
With all I am I worship all You are
For Your are
My only refuge and strength
Oh Deliver me
Deliver me
