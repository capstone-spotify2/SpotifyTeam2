La la la, la la la
La la la
Stay with me
La la la, la la la
La la la
Stay with me

Stay with me my dear
Walk with me, hold me near
It's not as late as it seems (No, no)
So why'd you take your love away from me?

La la la, la la la (la la la)
La la la
Stay with me (by the sea)
La la la, la la la (oh)
La la la
Stay with me

In the morning light
Or the shades of white
You're the only who tries
So why's it mean I'm saying goodbye?

La la la (oh), la la la (stay)
La la la
Stay with me (come on and stay)
La la la, la la la
La la la
Stay with me

Hold my hand, my dear
Treat me like your my own loving woman (hey hey hey)
Am I the only one you see? (ahhhh)
So why'd you take your love away from me?

La la la (look at you) La la la (ohhh ohh baby baby baby)
La la la
Stay with me (take your love from me)
La la la (oooooh come on baby) La la la (by by the sea..)
La la la
Stay with me
