I'm just saying that you're sounding dumb
It's kinda funny you're never wrong
Do you just wanna fake it, I don't wanna say shit.
Do you leave it alone?
Seen lesson, you sounded stumped
So many words and you're never wrong
Same old situation, now I feel so blatant
Finally figured you out!

Save the world from the fiction that you live in
Kill the soul, I need a show like interplay
Try alone to convince us that you mean it
Give it up, 'cause our way, no, you don't know a thing!

You're getting money, your lips are loud
So many words that I'm cutting out,
'Cause you just wanna fake it,
I don't wanna say shit, take it or leave it alone!
So get lost or get numbed
So we can say that you're all alone
You just wanna take somebody's reputation
Leave it back in your mind

Save the world from the fiction that you live in
Kill the soul, I need a show like interplay
Try alone to convince us that you mean it
Give it up, 'cause our way, no, you don't know a thing!

I'm praying for the sky to strike you down
Even the devil comes out to watch you drown.
Set us free, don't lie!
Set us free, don't lie!
Tell the world you have to let this go!
Just save yourself, I won't!

Save the world from the fiction that you live in
Kill the soul, I need a show like interplay
Try alone to convince us that you mean it
Give it up, cause our way, no, you don't know a thing!
