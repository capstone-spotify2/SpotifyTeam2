Sick of you, how old do you think you are?
Never move, you think everything's too far
Telling you you're a fool, but you don't wanna know
Thinking through and let me tell you, you're not even close...yeah I tell ya

I can't stay you're in the way, so listen when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me you might, be the one

What kept you, I'm not bothered anymore
Can't place it, get me heading for the door
Foot down, you know I like to look outside
You found it, you found something that you like...yeah I tell ya

I can't stay you're in the, so listen when I'm talking
Tell me when I should, i don't drink in your pub
What makes you think I work round your ohhhhohhhhhhhh

Don't feel bad, don't look back, don't feel bad
Don't feel bad and don't look back, I don't feel bad

Shame on you, you hate everything thats new
Look down your nose at everything I do
You catch on years later, you're not even slow
Can't stay have a good time, now I've gotta go

I can't stay you're in the way, so listen when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might, when I'm talking
Go look in a book, tell me when I should
Makes you think I would when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might when I won't!
