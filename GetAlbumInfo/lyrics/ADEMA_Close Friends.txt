Today you told me that I'd hate you forever
I can't believe what's really going on
Somehow I knew that you felt guilty for something
But tell me why you do this to me
Today you told me that I'd hate you forever
I can't believe that you'd wreck my life

I was betrayed, how can you say that you feel sorry inside
It's devastating, losing close friends
I've gone away, you make me stay but I can't deal with the lies
I've gone insane, losing close friends

Today I made the worst mistake
I put my trust into someone I don't know
And now I know because you've done everything possible to me
Made me so upset
And now I know just who to trust because you're laying in bed
You're thinking 'bout all that fucked up shit

I was betrayed, how can you say that you feel sorry inside
It's devastating, losing close friends
I've gone away, you make me stay but I can't deal with the lies
(Lies)
I've gone insane, losing close friends

I'm so weak
The closeness of your skin
The smell of this place
Makes me go insane

I 

You make me go insane

I was betrayed, how can you say that you feel sorry inside

I've gone away, you make me stay but I can't deal with the lies
I've got insane, losing close friends

Losing close friends
