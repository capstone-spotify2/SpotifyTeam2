Flatbush boy cruisin' Sheepshead Bay 
His boardwalk mama just a sniff away 
Underground DMT, ridin' thunder train 
The Coney Island white fish boy is on the run again 

Ooooh, runnin' with the pack 
Ooooh, and never lookin' back 
Ooooh, know's just where he's been 
That Coney Island white fish boy's 
Been there and back again 

Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen 
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams 
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel 
Streaked with Clorox bleach 
Coney gettin' down and dirty 
Snortin' up the beach 

And she'd be screamin' (Coney) 
And she'd be dreamin' (Coney) 
Go get 'em Coney 

(Coney), Bone To Bone screamin' 
(Coney) She be screamin' (Coney) 

In town 
Get back in town 
Get back, a get down 
Get back in town 
Coney! 
She'd be screamin' (Coney) 
Best believe it (Coney)
