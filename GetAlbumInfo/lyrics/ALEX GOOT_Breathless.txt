Hopefully youâll be fine without me by your side
Hopefully I will too
Times have changed and now I donât even know myself
Do I even want to?
You can breathe while I will suffocate myself
What is it about you?
You can breathe while Iâm out of oxygen tonight
What is it about you
That leaves me breathless
You leave me so breathless
And now I can be
Out of sight out of mind out of sight of you
You believe in lies
Like the one you told yourself
With your heart out on your sleeve
Make a note to say âitâs not over til itâs goneâ
Is there time for you and me?
You can breathe while I will suffocate myself
What is it about you?
You can breathe while Iâm out of oxygen tonight
What is it about you
That leaves me breathless
You leave me so breathless
And now I can be
Out of sight out of mind out of sight of you
