Empty glass
Gets another round
Squeaky chair
Makes another sound
There is a gentle breeze
Playing in your hair
Come take a bow
While youâre still 
All there

Itâs what it is
Itâs what it was
Itâs what it will be here
After us

There is no memory
Thereâs no recall
No recollections
At all

Your dark glasses
Sliding down your nose
Now bring these proceedings
To a close

Itâs what there is
Itâs what there was
Itâs what will be here
After us

Your dark glasses
Sliding down your nose
Now bring these proceedings
To a close

You can make it all worthwhile
You can lend yourself some style
You can give them all the reasons
Al the facts that you have seasoned

You can hear them hoot and holler
As you come across a scholar
You can set your name in lights
You can make two wrongs a right
