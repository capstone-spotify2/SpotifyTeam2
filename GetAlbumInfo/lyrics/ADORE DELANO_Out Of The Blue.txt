Last call on the boulevard
City of love and broken hearts
Crazy, beautiful, bizarre
Three words, everything you are

If you wanna light my cigarette
I might let you have a hit
I'm not into playing hard to get
We can have a night we won't regret

You are the perfect stranger
(Never saw you coming, never saw you coming)
I need some bad behaviour
(Want some dizzy lovin', want some dizzy lovin')

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

Come in, don't turn off the lights
You're my toy, just for the night
You can make me feel alive
So wrong, but it feels so right

Pick a name, I won't remember it
It's a shame, but you'll get over it
Gotta catch my flight at 10 to 6
Never say "bye" to just a fix

You are the perfect stranger
(Never saw you coming, never saw you coming)
I need some bad behaviour
(Want some dizzy lovin', want some dizzy lovin')

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

All I see is blue
All I want is you
All I see is blue
All I want is you
All I see is blue
Baby, all I want is you
All I see is blue
All I want is you
Out of blue
(There was you, there was you)
There was you
(There was you, there was you)
You, you

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
