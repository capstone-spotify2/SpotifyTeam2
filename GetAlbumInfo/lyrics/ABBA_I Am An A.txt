<i>[Frida:]</i> I am Frida. hello.
I'm the star of the show.
<i>[Agnetha:]</i> That's what she thinks, anyway.
<i>[Frida:]</i> And I like to perform.
Benny says I am warm.
<i>[Benny:]</i> Well hot is the least you can say.
<i>[Frida:]</i> Independant and free,
And ambitious, that's me.
And I'm tough too, you see.
<i>[Benny:]</i> No she's not. Just ask me.
<i>[Frida:]</i> Singing and dancing is what I like best.

<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> I am an A.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> I'm a B.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is okay.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> So is she.
<i>[ABBA:]</i> Singing together in harmony.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is a B.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> She's a bird.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> Fiddle-dee-dee.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> Yes, you heard.
<i>[ABBA:]</i> We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.

<i>[Bjorn:]</i> I am Bjorn. I'm the guy
Who is careful and shy.
Don't like to spend every dime.
But I love my guitar,
And I drive in my car.
<i>[Agnetha:]</i> Scares me to death every time.
<i>[Bjorn:]</i> And I don't like shave.
<i>[Agnetha:]</i> You should live in a cave.
<i>[Bjorn:]</i> No, I feel more at home on thew stage.
When I sing and I play
With my group, it's okay.
<i>[Benny, Angetha and Frida:]</i> Your group?! You're kidding! Or is it your age?

<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> I am an A.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> I'm a B.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is okay.

<i>[Benny:]</i> I am a B.
<i>[Frida:]</i> I am an A.

<i>[Agnetha:]</i> I'm Agnetha. hello.
I'm the young one, you know.
<i>[Frida:]</i> She never lets me forget.
<i>[Agnetha:]</i> I am gentle and mild.
Underneath it, I'm wild.
<i>[Bjorn:]</i> Craziest woman I've met.
<i>[Agnetha:]</i> I'm romantic, they say,
But it's not quite that way.
I'm down to earth, yes indeed.
And I like early nights, so I turn off the lights.
<i>[Bjorn:]</i> And I never get any chances to read.

<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> I am an A.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> I'm a B.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is okay.

<i>[ABBA:]</i> We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.

<i>[Benny:]</i> I am Benny, at last.
And I'm living quite fast.
I like to travel and see.
I can play in "the mood".
I like wine. I like food.
<i>[Bjorn:]</i> Now, that's somthing He just can't deny.
I can play day and night,
If the feeling's alright.
<i>[Frida:]</i> And that's somehimes a problem for me.

<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> I am an A.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> I'm a B.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is okay.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> So is she.
<i>[ABBA:]</i> Singing together in harmony.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> He is a B.
<i>[Benny and Bjorn:]</i> She's a bird.
<i>[Agnetha and Frida:]</i> Fiddle-dee-dee.
