I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge,
Don't need your ancient wisdom,
Two things I'll live without.

Relax,
(As children rest)
Patience people, 
There's no need to react so desperately tonight.
(You don't need to know the things I know) 
In fact,
(as children rest)
All of you will be sleeping with honesty intact,
(Our innocence intact)
So just give up tonight.
(If I knew then what I know now, I'd stay six years old)

If you lost everything in a moment, would you notice?
Could you rebuild something so hopeless? 
Are you hopeless?
And when you wake alone, with no one left to hold,
You wont need to know all the things I know.

Paradise in every swimming pool,
Paradise in every playground slide, 
Paradise, fresh baked in a cookie jar.
If I were you, I would defend my innocence visually.
I would fight all that tried to rob me of that.
Because there's some things you just don't need to know.

Tragedy in the dentist's office,
Tragedy in every skinned knee,
Tragedy spilled all over the kitchen floor.

I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge,
Don't need your ancient wisdom,
Two things I'll live without.

When you awake alone, with no one left to hold,
You won't need to know all the things I know,
You won't need to know all the things I know,
You won't need to know all the things I know.

I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge,
Don't need your ancient wisdom,
Two things I'll live without.
