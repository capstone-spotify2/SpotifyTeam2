Looking at me
You'de never know I'm fragile
Looking at me
You wouldn't guess that I might be, yeah
Afraid to crash afraid to burn as freely
As the last time I let go
All the shadows and suspicions that may appear to you as ice
Are not me being cold just thinking twice

I can build a big blue wall
No way in and no way out
But leave it up to you to prove me wrong
I'm afraid that I could crumble
Once the stones begin to move
It happens when you been too blue too long

There's a breeze
That's flickering the candles
And I can breath
A little deeper for a change, yeah
There's a chance outside this isolation
I'll be free to be held again
But if I am reluctant and if I begin to cry
It's because I'm unaccustomed to the light

I can build a big blue wall
No way in and no way out
But leave it up to you to prove me wrong
I'm afraid that I could crumble
Once the stones begin to move
It happens when you been too blue too long

You can stand in the street light
But live in the corners and no one knows
You're not there
You can smile for the camera
And make impression
And no one knows
You don't care

I can build a big blue wall
No way in and no way out
But leave it up to you to prove me wrong
I'm afraid that I could crumble
Once the stones begin to move
It happens when you been too blue too long
