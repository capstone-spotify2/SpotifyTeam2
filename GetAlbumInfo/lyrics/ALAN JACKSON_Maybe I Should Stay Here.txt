Maybe I should stay here 
For the rest of my life 
My compliments to you dear 
You're so easy on the eyes 
I'm likin' how my Jack and water mixes with your 
EstÃ©e Lauder ooh, so maybe I should stay here 
And keep makin' eyes at you 

Maybe you should stay here 
I beg you not to go 
There's something I must say dear 
I'm compelled to let you know 
My intuition makes me think 
That holdin' you's a possibility 
So maybe you should stay here 
And keep makin' eyes at me 

Some lover lose, some lovers win 
But honey I don't care 
Somebody said only fools rush in 
But me, I'm already there 

So maybe we should stay here 
'Cause here's where we belong 
Like me the night is lonely 
Like you the night is young 
There's no reason why 
We shouldn't have these feelings 
If it happens naturally, oh yeah 
So maybe we should stay here 
For all eternity. oh baby, we should stay here, 
Just you and me...
