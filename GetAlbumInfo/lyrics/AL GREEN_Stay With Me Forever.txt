Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met

This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be 'round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days

Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done, all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me, baby, yeah
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?

Please take my love, that's all I have to give
Just right now you're giving me a reason to live
Help me understand what I feel is real
For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years

And if you let me there is nothin' I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I just want you to stay a while with me, baby
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
C'mon and stay

Oh, c'mon take me by the hand, oh
Heaven, I want you to cherish me
C'mon, c'mon
