We sat and watched the sun come up
With a blanket wrapped around us
We spend all night out on that beach
Couldn't hold her close enough to me
That was love I won't forget
And I still remember what she said

She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go

The April air, the crescent moon
Two wild hearts with nothing to lose
That weekend was all we had
But what I'd give for two more days like that
She looked at me and said goodbye
And kissed my lips one last time

She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go

Kansas, I'll always remember
Kansas, I hear your name and I am with her

She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go

(Kansas) She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
Oh, no (Kansas)
She called me Kansas
