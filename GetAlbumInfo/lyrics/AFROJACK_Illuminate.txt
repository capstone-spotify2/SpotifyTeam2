Used it all for takes
But your heart maybe matters
And desire on your fate
With your fear where'd you after

Somewhere you keep up your halo
Scared of what they don't know
Open up your window shades
And illuminate

Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go

Is your sanity poor?
Cause you're starving for a reason
Make your sickness your cure
You invent what you believe in

Somewhere you keep up your halo
Scared of what they don't know
Open up your window shades
And illuminate

Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

And Illuminate
Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on

Go on and shine on
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go
