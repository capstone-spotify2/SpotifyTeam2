No more sadness now, nor fasting,
Now we put our grief away;
God came down, the Everlasting,
Taking human flesh to-day.
God came down on earth a stranger,
Working out His mighty plan;
God was cradled in a manger,
Very God and very man.

There were shepherds once abiding,
In the field to watch by night.
And they saw the clouds dividing;
And the sky above was bright.
And a glory shone around them,
On the grass as they wore laid;
And a holy Angel found them,
And their hearts were sore afraid.

"Fear ye not," he said, "for cheerful
Are the tidings that I bring,
Unto you, so weak and fearful,
Christ is born, the Lord and King"
As the Angel told the story
Of the Saviour's lowly birth,
Multitudes were singing "Glory
Be to God, and peace on earth."

Angel choir sing Hallelujah
God's redeeming love proclaim
Let Thy Church, in every nation,
Sing the glory of Thy name.

Angel choir sing Hallelujah

Let Thy Church, in every nation,
Sing the glory of Thy name.
Sing the glory of Thy name.
