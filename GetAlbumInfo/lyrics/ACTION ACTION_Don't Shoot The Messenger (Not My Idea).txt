Well, you look so true in undressed eyes.
Is your coma real?
Did you change your mind?
I see so clearly in these bargain eyes.
Words coffee drip out my head.

Time will set us free,
As we both roll back our eyes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.

I might be blessed with amnesia instead.
Ghost written parade,
All the nonsense said. (oh yeah)
The world keeps on sinning inside my head.
Your words are an army between wars.

Time will set us free as we both roll back our eyes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes.
I'm sorry now,
To say to you that everybody makes mistakes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.

I see so clearly inside my head,
Your words are an army between wars.

Time will set us free,
As we both roll back our eyes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes.
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea.

My idea.
Oh no, my my.
My idea, oh.
My my, my idea.
Oh, no, my idea.
Oh no no.
