Come on, come on, uh ey uh ey
Come on, come on, uh ey uh ey

I wanna feel in love, yeah
But only with my girl
'Cause you come around, and
Made me want you, mi amor
You kill me, kill me
I'm gonna die tonight
You move all my senses with your sweetest smile
Girl you're playing with my mind
(Dilemma dilemma dilemma)
Girl, you've made me feel so fine

Why you're playing with my mind
(Dilemma dilemma dilemma)
Come with me and stay the night!

Come on, come on, uh ey uh ey

There's a mystery hidden in your eyes
One point in this and I'm hypnotized

You are like the poison that makes sweet life
