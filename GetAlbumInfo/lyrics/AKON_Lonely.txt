Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely,
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely.

Yo this one here goes out to all my players out there, man, ya know
that got that one good girl who's always been there, man, like took all the bullshit
then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

I woke up in the middle of the night
and I noticed my girl wasn't by my side,
coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feenin,
so I had to take a little ride,
back tracking over these few years,
tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad,
'Cause ever since my girl left me my whole life came crashing

I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Can't believe I had a girl like you
and I just let you walk right outta my life,
after all I put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side,
what really hurt me is I broke your heart,
baby, you were a good girl and I had no right,
I really wanna make things right,
'Cause without you in my life girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
that can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
and I would be out chasing you
'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be,
ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be
so happy but now so lonely

So lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own)
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Never thought that I'd be alone,
I didn't think you'd be gone this long,
I just want you to call my phone,
so stop playing girl and come on home (come on home),
baby girl, I didn't mean to shout,
I want me and you to work it out,
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby,
and it's driving me crazy
'Cause...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own)
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, (so lonely),
Mr. Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely (so lonely), Mr. Lonely
