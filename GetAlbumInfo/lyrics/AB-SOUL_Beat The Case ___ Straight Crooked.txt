<i>[Beat The Case]</i>

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Doeburger!
Head swingin' like Rambo, he be spittin' like he pullin' triggers
Make a enemigo an example
(And I bet I beat the case)
Lot of guys with the gavels, look em' right up in they face
While a nigga under oath, plead the fifth, then ask if I can smoke
Burnin' dirty money but I keep a little something for the clean escape
And the rainy day after
Don't forget a nigga live where the heat wave at ya
And ya safe ain't safe
And heat don't wave back but life is cold that way
Ay man

All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case

<i>[ScHoolboy Q:]</i>
Got my chopper went to <i>[?]</i> bullets flying out the case
Only witnesses are gay, nothing sneaking on the tape
All I do is get the.. uh, yeah
Shoot you grabbin' in the bag
Shit you makin' it ain't half, of what I made up in the past
Groovy Tony with the moves, uh
My bank account done ate a moose, uh
Why the car ain't got a roof, uh
Crib still ain't got a boost, uh
Black hippy with the caps lock, when my album came..
Best album out in hiphop and I'm still heatin' up the crockpot
Platinum plaques that I ain't hung yet
You got opinions no achievements
Type of niggas make me laugh, uh
Hit the gas and turn to flash, uh
Palms itching like a rash, uh
My trigger finger be the stash, uh
Bitch I'm blankin' out the face, uh
(All I do is beat the case)

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case

Let me set the record straight
You got 10 commandments, 33 amendments over 20,000 laws
Raise your hand if you think you'll beat the case
Motherfuck a Bill of Rights
I need a bill of Miller's Lite
Phenergan up in my sprite
I ain't sippin' Miller Lite
I like to say my lighter white
Lit the spliff and went to space
Then I'm playin' with the white
What an interracial day
I made her write a different light
Got gerped up by the jakes
Had the work tucked, guns in the truck
Licenses suspended, but remember...

All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case

<i>[Straight Crooked]</i>

Ruffled up a couple feathers when I called Barack a puppet show
Now that Trump is POTUS I know this election is just another Muppet Show
That ain't even none of my business though
Whatever's your cup of tea
Even lil' Niemah voted for Hillary
I'm a entity, never mind my identity
My king Slim hit me with a quote that sticked with me
A criminal's best asset is his liability
(That was crazy, lie-ability)
Do What Thou Wilt nigga (Soul!)
Cause these niggas a have you swim across a ocean just to drown you in a lake
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Word, word yea
Make sure I was straight
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Don't <i>[?]</i>
The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy
In a sense, we all guilty
