Uh! Nigga I smell murda
Glock 9, but them niggas turn up
10 killas in the Chevy
Nigga 16 with the burner
Teller put the money in the bags, go and show me where the stash, actin funny with the cash hah?
Ok, niggas wanna play dumb-dumb
Dirty glocks, never knowin' where they come from
Bang, motherfucker get low
Hundred round chopper, that potato on the nose
Killas stay lurkin and they do it on purpose
I just tell em keep shootin like they tryna overdose
Keep playin with a real nigga
You gon end up in the box like Hilfiger
Yea, man you lookin at a gorilla
I don't like no niggas holdin niggas' glock like a 4 wheeler
Cus that bitch go to kickin, blue caine
All black when I'm ridin, Bruce Wayne
Niggas bump to the money, Hussein
Never change them true, 2 Chainz
Hundred grand to yo boys like loose change
Better hush for that choppa wanna do things
Bang! Chit-chit bang-bang!
Nigga!

Phone call from my Haitian homie say Papi got the good yay
No cellphone, no landlines, he do business off the 2 way
Call the homies, they gon run up on him, got sticks a waving too late
You know what I came for so don't play
Leave 100 O's round where you stay
Lawd, somebody call the popo
Snitch niggas die slow
Will they ever catch me?
Pussy nigga nono
Runnin out yo mouth, I'm just hopin you about it
Every nigga with me, boy that ready get started
No patdowns when I walk up in the party,
Smoking that stank, who he think he, Bob Marley?
No games
When I pull up in that foreign kill niggas
Hood nation, motherfucker, Real niggas
Won't stop, getting money, deal with it
Yea I'm fuckin yo bitch, I'm still in it
No tips on a whip so you see me in it
I can run through a clip, less than 2 minutes
Bang bang, reload til it start clickin

Uh, half a drank like who gave you?
Move caine, I've been Abel
Bakin soda, no label
TV on but no cable
Streets talkin, I heard em
Hands out but curd him
He don't wanna work, he just wanted work
That he can handout and just burn him
Heard it all before though
Then went and copped the 4 do
Told pop I needed 4 mo
He texted back like fo sho
10 choppas goin fofo
Come fofo, crack blow do
Had em all magnets
Why we don't spoke
I mean no speak, I thought I won't eat, nah
I'm tied niggas, tired niggas
Quick to talk how they tie niggas
I'm on the block like who's tied nigga
Gun is cocked like who's fine quicker
Corner pack like those my niggas
G spots, we rackin em
Church guarded, I'm backin em
That's a lot of money, we stackin em
