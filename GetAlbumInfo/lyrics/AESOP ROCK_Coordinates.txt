<i>[Aesop]</i>
I target the cruks of all that's considered sin
The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin
Color me what?
Spell-bound man hunting hell-hound
Special investigations set king pin
Bounce and of course your happy
Mic activist
Axis pivotal point spun all to often
Now walk and spin cycle 
Dug psychadelic syndrome jabs your abdomen
I'm adament with disperse and curse across
You're playing your chances broken branches
Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it
My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning
Magnetic field my metal mind driven
Threshold fresh coke crush and affect
Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate
The all absorbing metamorphing monument
Not that average once upon a glock, glock, glock
Dot, dot, dot, etcetera
The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina
Burning you back to immobile twitchin fetal position
Itching for what could have been if not for who

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic 
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone

Close encounters of the first kind
Contact cursed minds skies red
Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs
Over whim and worry flurried on your sidesteps
My pride treads thick
Utilize wide lens I slide strength in
Tell her gently we utilize mic like skeller
Tanky evidently all is not well
In a metra pot sell
Automatic hell habitat 
Tainted polutin it's toxic to me
The melancholy-olly-oxygen free on the night watch
Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy
Radically millions morphing the orphans
Spitting distortion
Piteous portions lacked a guiding light
Overiding and striding through the night
Story army extends mics like dendrites
I blend life 
Dark then gray shapes 
Till the splays made illustrate my views on sanity
If you're feeling famished we are family
Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter
I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all
Night crawling audio visual veterans
Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans
50 million poets screaming all on the run
That's 50 million hearts beating as one

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic 
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone
