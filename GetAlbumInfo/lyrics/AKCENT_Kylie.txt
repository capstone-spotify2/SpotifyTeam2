Kylie give me
Kylie give me

Baby, you're the one that melts my heart,
I swear I'm not lying
Maybe tonight I'm gonna try my luck
I can see that you want me

I'm dreaming about you every night
Every night

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car

Baby, take a minute, check me out,
I sit in the front row
Baby, I'm the coolest guy in the crowd,
I'm sure you have seen me

I'm dreaming about you every night
Every night

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car

You drive me crazy, you slowly drive me crazy
Red blooded baby, can't get you off my mind
I should be lycky, I should be so lucky
I should be lucky, to sleep with you tonight

Kylie
Kylie

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car

Kylie, give me just a chance,
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove,
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me,
Like a shining star
But I'd rather do you on the backseat of my car
