Well, you've taken everything we've got
Even the guitar and the band
They were makin' the right moves
Playin' in the blues like a light is at hand

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright

Don't you wanna go
Well, you've taken a right notion
Enough to fill the world and the ocean

While we're driving in your car
No one knows who you are
Let me know who, big people in power

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright

New York City, don't you wanna go, c'mon
Yeah sure, climb on
Don't you wanna go, c'mon
