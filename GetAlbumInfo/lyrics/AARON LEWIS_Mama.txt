My mama always told me
"Son, you'd best go easy down that road"
And she said she was sorry
For all the times she couldn't save my soul

I shoulda listened to her words a little more
Before I packed up and I walked right out that door

Daddy always told me
"Son, you'd better love the best you can"
And "Don't look back and be sorry
These moments won't be comin' 'round again"

But I feel like I could conquer the whole world
When I look up and see those three little girls

But I get lost, I can't find my way
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Mistakes I've made, consumed by some
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done

Now a preacher man once told me
"Son, I'm not so sure you can be saved"
He said, "Life is full of choices
And He sees all the bad ones that you've made"

And I said "Yeah, you're right, I'll probably go to Hell
But goddamn all the stories I can tell"

'Cause I'm so lost, I can't find my way
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Mistakes I've made, consumed by some
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done

So my mama always told me
"Son, you'd best go easy down that road"
