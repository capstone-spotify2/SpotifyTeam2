Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own

Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
The truth be known

That I love you
like all little children love pennies
And I love you cause
I know that I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose

And I love you like
all little children love pennies
And I love you like
good times of which I've known many
And I love you cause
I know you give me a heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose
