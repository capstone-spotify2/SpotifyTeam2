Drifting alone
Where am I to go
The purpose in me
Sadly I don't know

Who'll take my hand
I'm sailing in the sand
Nothing to enjoy
Feeling quite destroyed

But I know a magic dolphin
Swimming above the world
And in my dreams it promised me
That someday I'll find my girl

No one to love
No one to lose
All by myself
This is what I choose

Lovers everywhere
Why should I even care
Will I ever change
That would sure be strange

But I know a magic dolphin
Swimming above the world
And in my dreams it promised me
That someday I'll find my girl

She has the taste of summer
Cute shiny eyes of love
And untill I find that girl of mine
I have a friend above
Yes, I have a friend above

'Cause I know a magic dolphin
Swimming above the world
And in my dreams it promised me
That someday I'll find my girl

She has the taste of summer
Cute shiny eyes of love
Until I find that girl of mine
I have a friend above
I have a friend above
Yes, I have a friend above
