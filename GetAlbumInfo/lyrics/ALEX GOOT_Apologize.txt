I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
And I'm hearin' what you say,
But I just can't make a sound.
You tell me that you need me,
Then you go and cut me down...
But wait...
You tell me that you're sorry,
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say...

That it's too late to apologize.
It's too late...
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late, too late, oh, oh.

I'd take another chance,
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh.
I need you like a heart needs a beat,
But it's nothin' new, yeah!
I loved you with a fire red,
Now it's turnin' blue
And you say...
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid...

It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late, yeah

It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!

I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
