Something makes me run from nothing
Fucked up more than once and
Cleaninâ off my slate before I run again

You couldnât call me a saint, youâll have to call me a sinner
Comitting bigger, than 21 saying âwinner winner chicken dinner,â
I canât get civil, filled with evil, evil
Travels in messages from owls and eagles
No flowers so freedom, yeah
Iâve done wrong, Iâve fucked up
Canât take it back but I gotta face it with my fucking hands up
Her hate attack is tangable
Gimme one good reason I shouldnât walk on out that door
And count that cash that could be caught without your walk upon my chest
Iâm not, here

Not givinâ up some love is like a gun in my waistline
Safety off, got nowhere to be so I make everything take time
Everything remains fine, everyone runnin down their pre determined paths 
while I make my own, exploration around the world
Flown, to another destination, another girl
Never been that shiver down your little ass spine
Always been that plane of kush and a glass from the best vine

Itâs 5 AM
And she knows
