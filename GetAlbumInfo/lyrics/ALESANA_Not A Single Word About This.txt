I'd push you away
But you are the only thing I know

I can't help believing in you...
The idea of beauty leaves me enslaved
Say you'll stay for tonight
And I promise you this will be the last

I'd push you away
But you are the only thing I know
At your feet I now lay
You are the only thing I know, I know

I stare blindly into my reflection
A piece of me lost... I am terrified
That I cannot breathe without you
I am nothing in my eyes if not lost
I can't see past your eyes,
Without them I would die
Shackles cut my wrists as I fight the chains
None can hold me

I'd push you away
But you are the only thing I know
At your feet I now lay
You are the only thing I know, I know

In a room where I once told you everything,
I am alone, I am alone
Once beholden to nothing
And no one how is it that I am slave
to these eyes which glisten with untold secrets
that I crave so wildly to understand?
I must steel my heart to your warm gaze
I'll claw out my eyes and see you no more

It's because of you I sometimes wish that I would die
Sometimes I wish I would die
Leaving you behind
Enraptured by my ignorance,
I now deserve sympathy
