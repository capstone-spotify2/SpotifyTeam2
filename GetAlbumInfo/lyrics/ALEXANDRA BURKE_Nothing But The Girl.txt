Take all my money from me,
Nothing matters but the girl,
Take the recognition, take all the fame, even take my name
Nothing but the girl,
Take every stitch of clothing I own
And completely naked I would walk the world
People bloggin' talking crazy
I ain't gonna let it break me

Nothing matters but the girl
I dont need material things to represent myself as long as I know who I am
I dont need nothing else not nothing else
Nothing but the girl
No nothing matters
Ill tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Said nothing matters
Ill tell you nothing matters but the girl
I said nothing but me baby
No nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby

Take my seconds, minutes, hours all my precious time' cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Take my skills away the words I say reason and rhyme' cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Excuse me lord don't mean to interrupt
You know that it gets hard living in this world
But thank you in advance
For making me tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
No nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters

I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
Aint nothing in this whole wide world I can't do without nothing matters - but the girl
Special as the air I breathe that's the way I view me
Oh baby baby baby
I said nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing but the girl
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing but the girl
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but the girl
Nothing but the girl
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Ill tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but the girl
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
