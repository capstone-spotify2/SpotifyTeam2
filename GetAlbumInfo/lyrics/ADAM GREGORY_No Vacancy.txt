Down in Dallas lord those girls are fine
In Carolina they make you lose your 
mind sometimes
But it don't matter, it's wasted on me
'Cause everywhere I go you're the 
only one I see

So hang a sign on the wall there's no vacancy
No more rooms at all, this heart is taken, yeah
No more vacancies this heart is taken...
this heart is taken
No Vacancy

Try round the corner they might have 
something there
This heart hotel is all booked up nothing to spare
Once it was empty, but not anymore
Now do not disturb is right there on the front door

Like Panama City on spring break baby
In the whole darn town there's not a place to stay
But honey you've always got a reservation
Anytime...everyday
