Darling you were meant, 
for me, for me, for me.
Whatever you want baby,
You know I got it.
For you, for you,I want it for you.
You make my dreams, you make my life true

Gonna be alright too.

Nobody but you, baby.
Nobody but you <i>[X3]</i>
Nobody but you, baby. (Yes sir!)

Darling you, I'm not gonna hurry
To explain (explain)
That you are everything.

Hold my hand, Hold my hand
