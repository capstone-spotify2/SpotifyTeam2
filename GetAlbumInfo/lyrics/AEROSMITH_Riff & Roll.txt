Ooouu...
Hey, hey you 
Place your face on down the ground 
Hey, hey you 
With the junkies all around 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha feel inside is sad 

Hey, hey you 
With your face on the flame 
Hey, hey you 
This is all a silly game 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha feelin' down and sad 

You know you got that love 
Baby, inspiration 
(And you got them old generation) ? 
With your feet down 
Down on the ground 
You gotta sing songs baby 
When know you who's around 
Say baby 

Hey, hey wait 
Well whatcha do that whore 
Get your brains well they scrape them off the floor 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha got inside the door 

Yeah...hey, hey you 
What's up in the middle east 
Hey, hey you 
Won't'cha take another piece 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha feelin' kinda sad 

That's it, stay up there 
Stay up there
Stay...stay up there
Oooh...

One, two, three, four 

Hey, hey you 
With the face on the fire 
Hey, hey you 
Sing your ass off in the choir 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha let your face grow long 
Too long, too long 

Hey, hey you 
With your ass on the ground 
Hey, hey you 
Never say you get the sound 
Hey, hey you 
What'cha think of the sound
