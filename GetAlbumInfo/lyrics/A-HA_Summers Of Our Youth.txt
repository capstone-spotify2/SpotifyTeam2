There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
It happens all the time
Just let the plot unwind

As we look back and see
Our yesterdays entwine
The beauty and the truth
The summers of our youth

And you can go there anytime
The movies on your mind
And you can see it clearly
Where we overstepped the line

What are you gonna do when lights go out
What are you gonna think it's all about
What are you gonna do when time is up
What are you gonna do to make it change the way you feel?

Our life's a precious gift
You've felt it once or twice
How everything comes once
But once a million times

But you can find it anywhere
You know I speak the truth
I wish there was a way back to
The summers of our youth

What are you gonna do when time is up
What are you gonna do to make it stop
What are you gonna do when lights go out
What are you gonna think it's all..... think it's all about
