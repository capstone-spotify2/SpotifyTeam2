Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night 
Oh I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days.
Don't be afraid 

Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.

Stay with me
And we shall let expressions sing
Hear freedom virtues ringing
Oh memories of yesterdays broken dreams 
Don't you know they'll all fade away
If you'll come

Up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.

We'll laugh and I'll tell you the story of love 
(How it is) and the happiness in it baby
We'll combine our thoughts and together we'll travel 
To the fountain of loveliness.

I will never ever ever leave you alone to wonder 
As we go on 
Our love, it will grow much stronger stronger.
Don't you wanna 

Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.
