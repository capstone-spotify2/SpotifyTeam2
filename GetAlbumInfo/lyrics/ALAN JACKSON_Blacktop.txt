This ain't no song 'bout the good old days
Simpler times or easy ways
Oh how I long for an old dirt road
Greener grass or a lighter load

I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in '65
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes

Rain would fall and the mud would rise
Through my toes in the summertime
All those teen would drive and play
Dust would fly like a dandelion

I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in '65
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes

I stomp my toes on rocks and stones
Slept in fairy mo park homes
Watch my momma shake that line
Dusting clothes off hanging in a hot sunshine

I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in '65
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
