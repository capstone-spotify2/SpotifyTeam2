Number one is
The (clock) track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin'
The pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in
The distance runnin' darlin'
Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Stumblers stumblin'
Are gonna stumble on it
Bumblers bumlin'
Will bumble 'til they've found it
No more slumberin'
Get out from under darlin'
Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

I seen some lessons in that new school
You never laugh or smile or grin
The same expression if they boo you...
Now if that ain't the time to laugh
You've got'ta show me when

Paint some flowers on your wagon
To help yourself to laugh and grin
Pick up them trousers kid they're saggin'
And don't bite and snap
When you rap
And someone will let you in

Number on is
The track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin'
The pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in
The distance runnin' darlin'
Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Computers workin' but I'm starvin'
I'd to show it how to sweat
Before it's over we'll be farmin'
You know that just might be
The best thing to happen yet

Number one is
The track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin'
The pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in
The distance runnin' darlin'
Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move
