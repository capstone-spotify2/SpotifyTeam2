Loving her is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving her is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing her was blue like I'd never known
Missing her was dark grey all alone
Forgetting her was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving her was red
Loving her was red

Touching her was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing her was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with her was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting her was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing her was blue like I'd never known
Missing her was dark grey all alone
Forgetting her was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving her was red
Loving her was red
Yeah, red

Remembering her comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from her is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Oh, love is so red

Losing her was blue like I'd never known
Missing her was dark grey all alone
Forgetting her was like trying to know somebody you never met
And loving her was red
Yeah, yeah, oh so red
And loving her was red
Yeah, yeah, yeah red

Her love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
