There's a burnin' friction
That fuses fire
Tip all the gasoline
And the flames get higher
There's no compromise
No second prize
It's do or die
Someone ain't going home alive

This is a rivalry
This is between you and me
This is what what we, we all bleed
Cause this is a rivalry between you and me
(Wooh ooh ooh it's, between you and me)
(Wooh ooh ooh this, this is a rivalry)

There's blood on the ground
And bones in the dirt
Here we are on the frontlines
Get ready to hurt
There's no backin' down
I'm gonna stand my ground
It's do or die
Someone ain't going home alive

This is a rivalry
This is between you and me
This is what what we, we all bleed
Cause this is a rivalry between you and me
(Wooh ooh ooh it's, between you and me)
(Wooh ooh ooh this)
This is a rivalry

Cause this is a rivalry
This is between you and me
This is what what we, we all bleed
Cause this is a Rivalry
(Wooh ooh ooh it's, between you and me)
(Wooh ooh ooh this, this is a rivalry)
(Wooh ooh ooh)
This, between you and me
(Wooh ooh ooh)
This, this is a rivalry
