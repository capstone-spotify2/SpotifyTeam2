Getting in the heat
Coming with the beat
And I love what I feel
Hard and heavy

And I'm moving on and on
'cause my life is on the run
Now I feel the need to cry
Oh, yeah - I'm aiming high

Longing all my life
Waiting for a friend
Who is fighting like I do
Likes to do it hard and heavy

It's a man's, man's world
Filled with love and pain
And he never gets enough
And that keeps him very tough

Aiming high - aiming high
And I'm waiting for relieve
To the best of my believe
Aiming high - aiming high
What a fight to get it right
For a minute of delight

Falling in the deep
Dreaming in my sleep
How it burns to be cruel
Hard and heavy

I feel lower more and more
'cause I won't do it anymore
And I feel the need to cry
Oh, yeah - I'm aiming high

Aiming high - aiming high
And I'm waiting for relieve
To the best of my believe
Aiming high - aiming high
What a fight to get it right
For a minute of delight

Aiming high indeed
Seeking for my need
That is my sense of touch
Hard and heavy, way too much

Aiming high - aiming high
And I'm waiting for relieve
To the best of my believe
Aiming high - aiming high
What a fight to get it right
For a minute of delight

Aiming high...
