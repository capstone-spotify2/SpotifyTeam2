Help me, I can't get out,
And I live my life not knowing what it's about,
Just stains of guilt on my mind;
Heaven's what I want to find.
This is now, that was then:
I want to be born again.

(Oh!)

The darkness came, 
The light fought through, 
Mercy is all
I ask of you. 
The darkness came, 
The light fought through, 
Mercy is all
I ask of you. 

Father, Father, 
please set me free,
From my misery.
Father, Father, 
please set me free,
From my misery.

I will be with you

In the beginning, I used to believe
That you were no saviour, but I was naive.
You were a stranger that I couldn't see.
Now I'm in danger; please set me free.

Resurrected
We've been told

Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
Pray for us, sinners now,
And at the hour of our death,
Save us.

Where would I be, 
Without you standing next to me?
I am the lock and you are the key
Release me from my,
Release me from my
Insanity.
