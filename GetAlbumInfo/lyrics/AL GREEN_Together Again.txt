Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
