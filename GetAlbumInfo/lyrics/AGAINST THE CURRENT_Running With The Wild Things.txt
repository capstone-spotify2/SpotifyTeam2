Oo they don't hear us
Read us bedtime stories from their textbooks
Oo try to reign us in
Blind to our intelligence

Standardization of the masses
Give us a number fail or pass us
Education, manipulation
Decide our fate but never ask us

We're about to boil over
You can't keep us down forever

We got too big for the cage you locked us up in
Let's mark this down as the day that we started something
So open the gate, open the gate cause when we
Finally escape, finally escape we'll be
Tearin' through the streets
Running with the wild things

Oo-ooh
Ooo-ooo-oh, ooo-ooo-oh
Oo-ooh
Ooo-ooo-oh, ooo-ooo-oh

Hey, why you waitin'?
Quit carvin' notches to count the days 'cause
They're losing power
See 'em growing weaker by the hour

We're about to boil over
You can't keep us down forever

We got too big for the cage you locked us up in
Let's mark this down as the day that we started something
So open the gate, open the gate cause when we
Finally escape, finally escape we'll be
Tearin' through the streets
Running with the wild things

Oo-ooh
Ooo-ooo-oh, ooo-ooo-oh
Oo-ooh
Ooo-ooo-oh, ooo-ooo-oh
