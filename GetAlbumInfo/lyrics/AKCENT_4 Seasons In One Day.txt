<i>[I:]</i>
I remember those times that we shared
The moment I brought you your breakfast in bed
I still hear your voice in my head
When you used to whisper your love, than you cared.

<i>[Refren:]</i>
Baby, please tell me why you left me behind
If I did you wrong than I apologize
Cause no one could love you more
4 seasons in one day

Passing me by since you left that day.
I need to have you back into my life
Baby, I swear I will make it right
4 seasons in one day.

<i>[II:]</i>
I remember your favorite song
I played it so many times since you've been gone
Still remember the flowers that you bought
Where once was your picture there's nothing no more.

<i>[Refren]</i>

Losin' my mind since you've gone away
My life is empty, now you said goodbye, oh why?
Don't tell me a way, please come back into my life
In my life..., in my life...
(4 seasons in one day)
Come in my life
(4 seasons in one day)
4 seasons in one day...
Losin' my mind since you've gone away
My life is empty, now you said goodbye, oh why?
Don't tell me a way, please come back into my life
In my life..., in my life...
(4 seasons in one day)
Come in my life...
