They say Live by the system
Abide by what's written
Rules are just the way it is and not meant to be questioned
Go to school go to college with that knowledge get a job
Cause it's all about the money and that's how the moneys got
Grow up get a family trade dreams for a decent salary
Once your own shape now a square through life's geometry
So now you fitting real damn snug inside that cubicle
Voice inside your mind screaming life could have been beautiful

We are those who let that voice speak loudly
Throw our hearts to the people wear our honesty proudly
Spill our guts to the masses so they know they ain't alone
Hit em with the messages that ain't hittin' their phone
Journey through the sound waves and straight into your soul
Let ya know that life is somethin' only you can mold
When you feel your at edge throw you something you can hold
Bring you back to earth and put you back in control

Cause I don't wanna be society's casualty
We are the artist where heart is building reality
Drift to the mountains when they been clouding my imagery
Mother Nature do send for me when their world try to finish me

Back to my spot
Back inside my thoughts
Misery love company
These days I walk alone
They ask me if I'm lost said I was but made it home
They ask me bout the cross said I leave that talk alone
I like to not limit the things that we could be
Cause when I look into the stars I see a lot is left to read
There's a lot that I've been told of and my eyes are yet see
Places I've been shown but air my lungs are yet to breathe

So let me live my life
Only I decide if how I live is right
I know we could go back and fourth all night
But life is infinite and I swear it's meant to inspire
Spark going I'm growing till hope is moving in fire
Said the worlds getting dark add to the light through my lighter
If you saying we ain't dope hope you choke and know you a liar
You can sit back and watch me set the world on fire

Cause I don't wanna be society's casualty
We are the artist where heart is building reality
Drift to the mountains when they been clouding my imagery
Mother Nature do send for me when their world try to finish me

Raised on no ceilings
No limits at all
Grew surrounded by mountains no levels too tall
I was gifted this mind set ill gift it to y'all
Gift it right back if I ever should fall
6,200 feet most live under my feet
Live at a height in which most couldn't breathe
Tryna get to a height that most lives haven't seen
Cause I woke out my nightmares proceeded to dream

But when the world
Try's to break me down
Take me back to where my peace is found
The wind through the trees whispers through the breeze
Out here no one can tell me that I can't live dreams

Cause I don't wanna be society's casualty
We are the artist where heart is building reality
Drift to the mountains when they been clouding my imagery
Mother Nature do send for me when their world try to finish me
