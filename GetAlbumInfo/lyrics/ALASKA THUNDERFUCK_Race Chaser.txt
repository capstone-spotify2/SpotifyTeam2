Well, hey there little fella
I reckon I've seen you on the TV
Well, why don't you mosey on over to my mighty steed
Take a ride into town...
Race chaser, please!

Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!
Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!

Gonna tell a story 'bout a boy I met one night
A-meetin' and a-greetin', everything he said was right
I gave him lots of lovin' and a ticket to my show
Didn't take long to find he's just a clown at the rodeo

Silly me, how could it be
This tumbleweed is chasin' me
Silly you, could it be true
Hang up your boots, I'm on to you
Really, cowboy?

Round and round, and a do-si-do
Same old thing at every show
I'm not tryna waste my time
If you're just goin' on down the line
Ridin' up thinkin' you're so smart
Think again boy, bless your heart
Up in my hen house actin' cute
One more chicken who's flown the coop

Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!
Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!

Fool me once?
Shame on you, race chaser!
Fool me twice?
You ain't never gonna fool me again!

I've just learned a lesson every Ru Girl knows too well
It happens every city, all these boys are raisin' hell
They might be real pretty, but they're blinded by the lights
Just fishin' for the follows and a wranglin' of the likes

Silly me, how could it be
This tumbleweed is chasin' me
Silly you, could it be true
Hang up your boots, I'm on to you
Really, cowboy?

Round and round, and a do-si-do
Same old thing at every show
I'm not tryna waste my time
If you're just goin' on down the line
Ridin' up thinkin' you're so smart
Think again boy, bless your heart
Up in my hen house actin' cute
One more chicken who's flown the coop

Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!
Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!

You're just chasin' the race, ain't ya?
Get along little doggy, okurrrrr?

Race chaser?
You've been chasin' me all around this town
And you think you've got just another notch on your belt buckle
Well, I've got news for you!
I've got a race chaser in every town too! Woo-hoo!

Round and round, and a do-si-do
Same old thing at every show
I'm not tryna waste my time
If you're just goin' on down the line
Ridin' up thinkin' you're so smart
Think again boy, bless your heart
Up in my hen house actin' cute
One more chicken who's flown the coop

Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!
Race chaser! Woo-hoo!
Race chaser! Yee-haw!
