With her little one in one arm
And the laundry in the other
She could sure use a helping hand
But thats just the life of a single mother

Somebody's calling on the phone
Somebody's knocking at the door
She forgets and burns the dinner
Throws it across the kitchen floor
And for a moment she wants to give up and break down

But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby

And when the day is done
She'll tuck her angel in
She'll turn out the lights and start missing him again
Her mascara slowly runs down her face

But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying 

But the baby is getting older
The lonely nights are getting colder
And what she wouldn't give to have a shoulder to cry on
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby
