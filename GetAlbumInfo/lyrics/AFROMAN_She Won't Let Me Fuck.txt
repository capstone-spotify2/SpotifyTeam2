Hey sugar, how you doing, huh
Your pretty face don't match that nasty attitude
What you mean where my girl
Probably with your man
Can we fuck?

She won't let me fuck
(Baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Ohh)

She won't let me fuck
(Honey)
I really need to bust a nut
(Ohh)

It's so frustrating, yeah
Being a man
All these sexy women
Don't understand

Things we need to do, yeah
Every other day or two
Like take you home, baby yeah
And make sweet love to you
But you you won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck
(You say the mood ain't right, uh)
I really need to bust a nut
(I know that pussy's tight)

She won't let me fuck
(Oh, give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Ohh)

Her heart is still broken
Her emotions are sore
She's trying to recover
From the man before

Her ex-boyfriend
He probably can't see
That it was easy for him
But, uh, he made it hard for me
'Cause she, she won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck
(Oh, give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(You know just what I need, yeah)

She won't let me fuck
(Girl, you eating all my food)
(Girl drinking all my beer)
I really need to bust a nut
(You're smoking all my weed, yeah)

You rub your ass against me
On the disco floor
I asked you for your number
And you said hell no

You always hang around me everyday
Different women wanna kick it
But you scare them away

Now I get up ended
When you come around
'Cause I'm tired of my organs
Going up and down
That sucks
'Cause she won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck
(Oh, give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Don't play with my head again)

She won't let me fuck
(Let me hit it, baby)
(Yeah, let me hit it, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Are you a lesbian)

Oh, let me lick it baby
Yeah, let me stick it, honey
I'll give you my money
Girl, you can have it all
Go ahead and have a ball
If you want you can take ?em both, baby

In the year 2000
I see thousand
Of pretty young women
I found arousin'
Grocery store shoppin'
Magazine browsin'

Many different ways
To keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom
I walk toward 'em

Get 'em close to me
'Cause I'm suppose to be
Male aggressor
Female impresser

Say the right things
Possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game

Silly woman she game
Baby, what's your name
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek

Crack a smile and politely speak
With intelligent to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
Yah!

The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin' and pretendin' my dick's not extendin'
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away, bitch, blew my cover

She won't let me fuck
(You know I love it)
I really need to bust a nut
(Please don't change the subject)

She won't let me fuck
(We could've fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut
(But your telephone number is bone)

She won't let me fuck
(Girl, you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut
(You dress so provocative, yeah)

She won't let me fuck
(I can see your lingerie from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut
(Bitch, you must think I'm gay)

Aw, don't make me beg
Baby, let me rub your leg
Don't make me cry
Look into my eyes

Girl you so damn pretty
Stop acting so <i>[unverified]</i>
Let me rub some oil on your ti hahaha
Yo I'm up outta here she don't want to fuck 'cuz
