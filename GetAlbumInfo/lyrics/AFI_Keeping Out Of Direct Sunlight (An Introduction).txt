We are the ones with the radiating eyes. 
We are the Ones who have a fire inside. 
We are the ones only we can recognize. 
We've been rejected (we've been rejected)- 
Suffered the ignorance, suffered the selfishness, 
been pushed so far down now comes our time to surface. 
Turn from the light, that made them all go blind. 
We've been protected (we've been protected) 
ALL ARISE TO WHAT WE BRING,
OUTSTRETCHED HANDS, UNFOLDED WINGS. 
We've hurt ourselves, and I feel the sting of
broken hearts and burning wings...
