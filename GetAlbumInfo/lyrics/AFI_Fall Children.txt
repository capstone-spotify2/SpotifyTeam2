As the cries start to penetrate still air.
This day we celebrate.
The wait now ends.

From four corners smoke plumes into the reddened sky.
(Woah, oh. Woah, oh)
In the face of lantern light, tonight my destiny lies.
(Woah, oh. Woah, oh oh oh!)

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
This day so hallowed, this day so hallowed,
From here to forever its will I will follow.
(This day so hallowed, this day so hallowed)
Tonight will come to life.

Deadened branches stirred by whispers in the wind.
(Woah, oh. Woah, oh)
Fall children fill the streets at dusk, at last, it all will begin.
(Woah, oh. Woah, oh oh oh!)

This day so hallowed,
This day so hallowed,
From here to forever its will I will follow.
(This day so hallowed, this day so hallowed)
Tonight will come to life.

<i>[Davey yells]</i>
<i>[14 seconds of Oh!'s]</i>

Wallow. Wallow. Wallow-ooo-oow!
Wallow. Wallow-oow!
GO!

Fall children!

This day so hallowed,
This day so hallowed,
From here to forever its will I will follow.
(This day so hallowed, this day so hallowed)
Tonight will come to life
(Woah, oh oh oh!)
To life!
(Woah oh oh.)
