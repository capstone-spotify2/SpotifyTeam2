I don't know what to do 
I can't believe it's true that 
You can make me feel this way 
I see it in your eyes 
It made me realize 
There's something that I've got to say 
I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry 
For all the things I've done to make you worry 
And all the time I've cared for you from the bottom of my heart 
I will be yours if you'll be mine 
I will be there till the end of time 
I will be with you until the day that I die 
I'll be yours. I'll be yours 
I've been around the world 
And have seen a lot of girls 
But n one can compare to you 
It's really plain to see 
That you belong to me 
Cause you're the only one I need.
