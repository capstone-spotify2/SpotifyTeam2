<i>[Touche]</i>
Oh if someone writes a song with a simple Rhyme 
<i>[`N Sync]</i>
Just a song where is feeling show 
<i>[The Moffats]</i>
And if someone feels the same about the simple song 
<i>[Gil]</i>
oh sometimes you can hear them sing 
<i>[Sqeezer]</i>
music gives you Happiness and Sadness
<i>[Nick-BSB]</i>
But it also, also heals your soul 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control
let the music give you the power to
move any mountain 

<i>[Touche]</i>
If someone plays piano with some simple chords 
<i>[Aaron]</i>
So melodic and endearing, too 
<i>[Brian-BSB]</i>
Oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano 
<i>[The Boyz]</i>
And maybe you can hear them sing 
<i>[Nick-BSB]</i>
Music gives you Happiness and Sadness 
<i>[`N Sync]</i>
But it also 
<i>[Blumchen]</i> it also heals your soul 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Brian-BSB]</i>
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control
let the music heal your soul 

<i>[Chorus x 4]</i>
