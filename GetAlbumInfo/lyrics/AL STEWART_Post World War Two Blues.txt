I was a post-war baby in a small Scots town 
I was three years old when we moved down south 
Hard times written in my mother's looks 
With her widow's pension and her ration books 
Aneurin Bevan took the miners' cause 
The the House of Commons in his coal dust voice 
We were locked up safe and warm from the snow 
With "Life with the Lyons" on the radio 
And Churchill said to Louis Mountbatten 
"I just can't stand to see you today 
How could you have gone and given India away?" 
Mountbatten just frowned, said "What can I say? 
Some of these things slip through your hands 
And there's no good talking or making plans" 
But Churchill he just flapped his wings 
Said "I don't really care to discuss these things, but 
Oh, every time I look at you 
I feel so low I don't know what to do 
Well every day just seems to bring bad news 
Leaves me here with the Post World War Two Blues" 

1959 was a very strange time 
A bad year for Labour and a good year for wine 
Uncle Ike was our American pal 
And nobody talked about the Suez Canal 
I can still remember the last time I cried 
The day that Buddy Holly died 
I never met him, so it may seem strange 
Don't some people just affect you that way 
And all in all it was good 
The even seemed to be in an optimistic mood 
While TW3 sat and laughed at it all 
Till some began to see the cracks in the walls 
And one day Macmillan was coming downstairs 
A voice in the dark caught him unawares 
It was Christine Keeler blowing him a kiss 
He said "I never believed it could happen like this 
But oh, every time I look at you 
I feel so low I don't know what to do 
Well every day just seems to bring bad news 
Leaves me here with the post World War Two Blues" 

I came up to London when I was nineteen 
With a corduroy jacket and a head full of dreams 
In coffee bars I spent my nights 
Reading Allen Ginsberg, talking civil rights 
The day Robert Kennedy got shot down 
The world was wearing a deeper frown 
And though I knew that we'd lost a friend 
I always believed we would win in the end 
'Cause music was the scenery 
Jimi Hendrix played loud and free 
Sergeant Pepper was real to me 
Songs and poems were all you needed 
Which way did the sixties go? 
Now Ramona's in Desolation Row 
And where I'm going I hardly know 
It surely wasn't like this before but 
Oh, every time I look around 
I feel so low my head seems underground 
Well every day just seems to bring bad news 
Leaves me here with the Post World War Two Blues 

Oh, every time I look at you 
I feel so low I don't know what to do 
Well every day just seems to bring bad news 
Leaves me here with the post World War Two Blues
