I had a dollar in my pocket
And dirt on my hands
She was a rich mans daughter
Who didn't give a damn
She had all the boys talkin'
With her fancy cat walkin'
But it was me who took her home
And gave her bed a good rockin'

That at the end of the day
Honey when its all said and done

I cant get enough of that Diamond in the Rough

Early next morning I woke up naked and beat
And as the sun was rising
She was still lookin' like a treat

I stuck my finger in the honey
Threw my dollar in the wall
And when I made my wish
You know it was clear as a bell

That at the end of the day
Honey when its all said and done

I cant get enough of that Diamond in the Rou
