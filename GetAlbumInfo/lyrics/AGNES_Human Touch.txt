I-I wanna feel
Wanna feel human touch, human touch

Leave the ground and fly with me
Over land and over seas
Far away and out of reach
To be as one
We could be as one

Leave your doubts and trust in me
We can make some history
We are young and we are free
To be as one
Be as one

Wanna feel your touch all over my body
Wanna hear you say you can't live without me
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch
Wanna feel your heartbeat closer than ever
Wanna hear you say it's now and forever
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch

Leave the world without a trace
You and I and out of space
We can play with hearts and spades
To be as one
We could be as one

Leave your doubts and trust in me
We don't have to make believe
We are young and we are free
To be as one
Be as one

Wanna feel your touch all over my body
Wanna hear you say you can't live without me
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch
Wanna feel your heartbeat closer than ever
Wanna hear you say it's now and forever
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch

I-I wanna feel
Wanna feel human touch, human touch
I-I wanna feel
Wanna feel human touch, human touch

I-I wanna feel (feel, feel, feel)
Human touch, human touch
I-I wanna feel (feel, feel, feel...)

Wanna feel your touch all over my body
Wanna hear you say you can't live without me
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch
Wanna feel your heartbeat closer than ever
Wanna hear you say it's now and forever
I don't wanna have to wait any longer for
Human touch, human touch

I-I wanna feel
Wanna feel human touch, human touch
I-I wanna feel
Wanna feel human touch, human touch
