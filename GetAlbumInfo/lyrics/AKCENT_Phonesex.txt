My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
My phone is ringing and it's turning me on
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
I'm gonna scream like a whore...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing, my baby is calling me now...

I turn off the light in my room
I imagine you are Heidi Klum
Baby, I'm gonna call you soon.
Take off you dress,
Feel my caress
It's just phone sex...

My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
My phone is ringing and it's turning me on
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
I'm gonna scream like a whore...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing, my baby is calling me now...

I fill up the glass of red wine
Maybe now it's about the right time
Baby, you and I call the hotline.
Take off you dress,
Feel my caress
It's just phone sex...

My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
My phone is ringing and it's turning me on
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming
I'm gonna scream like a whore...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing, my baby is calling me now...

Yo, baby, I think I'm pregnant...

Say Hello, please <i>[?]</i>, it's me calling
Say Hello, stop playing with my mind
Say Hello, you know why I am calling
Your baby is cute but cannot be mine.

My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing or am I dreaming...
My phone is ringing, my baby is calling me now...
