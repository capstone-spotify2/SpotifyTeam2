(Five six seven fifty) 

You fucked it up
You should've quit
Till circumstances
Had changed a bit

You fucked it up
You jumped the gun
I swore you off but
You climbed back on

And when you said
Of course you know
Could I be blamed
If I'd wished it so
I don't think so

You fucked it up
Or was it you
'Cause when you said it
I said it too
What of it

And all that stuff
I knew before
Just turned into
Please love me more
Please love me more
Please love me more
Please love me more
Please love me more
Please love me more
Please love me
