Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distance
