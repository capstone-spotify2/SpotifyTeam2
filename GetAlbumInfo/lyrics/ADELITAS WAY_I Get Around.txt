I lie, every time they ask the question,
You lie, but it's something that I never mention,
You sound dumb, saying your not like that,
I'll ask you now, tell me your not like that,

You know I'm like that, I know your like that,

Cause I get around, truth is yeah I get around,

You said, normally I'd never do this,
But I laugh, when I think about what the truth is,
You don't know, I know that we're lying,
Ask me now, I think I'll deny it,

You know I'm like that, I know your like that,

Cause I get around, truth is yeah I get around,

Come take a ride, a ride with me,
Too many girls, I'll tell you now how,
