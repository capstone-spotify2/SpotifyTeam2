She always says she loves me when weâre drinkin
Wonât admit it but itâs true
I think Iâve had enough of this one
So baby whatâs your name, where you from, whatâs good with you?

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
When sheâs drunk she calls me a punk
She blow my phone up, she donât know whatâs up
When she drink that jack, she wonât call back
When she off that rum, she act so dumb
She tells me grow up, I say âKnow what?â
She wonât let me finish, she starts to go nuts
Stop throwing stuff, time to own up
Iâm so done, baby Iâm so done
All I need to do is turn my back, and sheâll be gone for good
Finished packing my bags, going where I know I should
Itâs only right for me to move on to whatâs next
But when she texts me with those three words, it gets me like

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Sheâs gotta quit showing off to all her friends
And go pick up someone else who can handle her shit
Iâm so sick of this and I canât pretend
But Iâll be stuck with this girl like wet cement
I donât want her following in my footsteps
But I think my shadow needs it
Despite her good side, and some good sex
Iâd rather go through amnesia and forget all about it
No reason to get so dramatic
Iâm more manual, sheâs automatic
Oh, tryna get rid of her static
I got smacked last night, it makes sense tonight
Well, itâs time to tell her that Iâve had it, cuz

<i>[Bridge - Dave:]</i>
Take my hand, letâs start new
I wasnât planning on it but Iâm liking you
And we just met, but I get you
You seem like the type thatâs got something to prove
Come on and dance, letâs see you move
This ainât the first time that Iâve noticed you
Take off those heels, letâs keep em new
Now bring that body closer for a few
