Put it on to me
I can hear you baby
'Cause we've been
Here once before
I can feel the heat
Don't you feel it baby?
And it makes me
Want you more

Didn't you tell me yesterday
We gotta take it all the way

We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh

And now
You're close to me
We got to move together
And I've never
Felt so sure

Your sexuality,
I'm in a love hangover
The rhythm of your body
Is the only cure

Carried away
Like butterflies
Feeling the music
Takes you high
Baby, You know we're

We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop

We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop

'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh
I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it,
I like it

Go for the stars
And feel the sky
We gotta do
That everytime

We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
