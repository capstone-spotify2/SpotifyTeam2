Six figures enter; they've come to destroy the world. 
They've called together this storm almost every night.
I awake in another place. 
A familiar voice with a stranger's face speaks more unheard words. 
What new friends will the day bring?
One for one thousand acquainted.
What new home will the night bring? 
When it all comes down you just throw the bones.
On the way I saw five hours of sleep but your fire makes it all worth while. 
On the way I wrote words for you to keep.
On the way, I saw myself. 
Lost myself along the way.
