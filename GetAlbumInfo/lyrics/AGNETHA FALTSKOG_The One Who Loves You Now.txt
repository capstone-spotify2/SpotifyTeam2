Everything I ever had
I let it slip away
Every dream I ever dreamed
Was lost until today
For I have seen tomorrow
Where my future lies
I see it every time when I
Look into your beautiful eyes

Oh, I'm holding on now
I'm holding on now

Love, don't let me go
Love, please let me know
Have you been waiting
Just the way that I've been waiting

Love, don't let me go
Love, please let me show
How much I want to
Be the one who loves you now

Maybe I was too afraid
To show my broken heart
Fading in the shadows
'Til my world just came apart
Looking at you now
I feel what I never felt before
But I am finally ready
To risk it all once more

Love, don't let me go
Love, please let me know
Have you been waiting
Just the way that I've been waiting

Love, don't let me go
Love, please let me show
How much I want to
Be the one who loves you now

If you believe in taking chances, oh
Baby, take this one with me
Can't you see what I see
I'm holding on

Oh, love, don't let me go
Love, please let me know
Have you been waiting
Just the way that I've been waiting

Love, don't let me go
Love, please let me show
How much I want to
Be the one who loves you now

Please let me show
How much I want to
Be the one who loves you now
Mmmhâ¦
Be the one who loves you now.
