I was left as a child
dragged from the cradle, I was weaned in the wild
ran with the wolfpack, flesh torn to shreds
in the compensations, I was left there for dead

read it in the paper it ain't fair
you know who today don't seem to care
livin', lovin', gettin' loose
masturbatin' with a noose
now someone's kickin' out the chair

some kind of voodoo
come across this land
some kind of voodoo
voodoo medicine man

everybody's lookin' at the sky
don't believe the coverups and lies
they been tellin' us since birth
pissin' off old Mother Earth
my gones are bygones prophesied

get ready

wonder should I go or should I stay
'cause what we got ain't workin' anyway
I did my best, God knows I tried
I feel like I been crucified
why did you take it all away

voodoo, voodoo, medicine man <i>[repeat]</i>
