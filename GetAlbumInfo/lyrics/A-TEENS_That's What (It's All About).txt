That's what it's all about

It's midnight, we're feeling all right
Dressed up for a cruise tonight
Nothing can hold us back
We're alive and right on track
All set, ready for a show
It's gonna blast, get outta control
Nothing can stop us now
There's a party going on - tear the roof down!

If you say, that it's okay
We gotta start right now

<i>[Chorus]</i>
That's what its all about baby
That's the way that it's got to be
That's what it is going on baby
That's right, that's right
That's what it's all about baby
That's what it comes down to baby
I want you to hear me out
That's what it's all about 

Half past twelve
We're sneaking out the back door
Who said, we couldn't stay out more
Till the lights go out
We're gonna show what its all about
We're gonna take it to the top
Never gonna stop
Cause we might, do it till we like
Spread the word around
When the drum rolls, time to get down

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh yeah
There's nothing that can stop us now
I swear we'll always be around

If you say, that it's okay
We gotta start right now

<i>[Chorus]</i>

That's what it's about... 
That's what is going on...
