"Take up thy cross and follow Me," 
I heard my Master say; 
"I gave My life to ransom thee, 
Surrender your all today."

Wherever He leads I'll go, 
Wherever He leads I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.

He drew me closer to His side, 
I sought His will to know, 
And in that will I now abide, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.

Wherever He leads I'll go, 
Wherever He leads I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.

My heart, my life, my all I bring 
To Christ who loves me so; 
He is my Master, Lord, and King,

Wherever He leads I'll go, 
Wherever He leads I'll go, 
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, 
Wherever He leads I'll go.

Wherever He leads Iâll go.
