<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there

<i>[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pac's song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin' babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still they'll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, that's a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin' a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin' too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds could've been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say I'm a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way nigga's kneel to my feet, don't be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon' love it cause I love it
What's that?

<i>[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

<i>[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple A's and Footlocker T's
Two toned fitteds from Swap Meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldn't holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Can't forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT would've been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakey's for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin' saggin' with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
I'm Jim Dear over here, that's the mayor say your prayers
It's C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mother's own
Turn my shakin' haters off and I'm right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon' love it, cause I love it
What's that?

<i>[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]</i>
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

<i>[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]</i>
How you like your stay so far?
Is it all it's cracked up to be?

<i>[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin' fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin' this
I do this for y'all, cause y'all can relate to me, you're my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Bannana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo in central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched ever Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon' love it
Cause I love it

<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i>
Sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like I'm the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing y'all niggas could tell me
