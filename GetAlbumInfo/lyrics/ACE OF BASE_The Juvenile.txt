The juvenile
In a time where the night is so cold 
The juvenile
Has the key to the end 
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here 
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend

Why don't we do it
Like they used to do it all so long ago
They kept together till the bitter end (Old and young)
Today we don't care
Either but the youth or but the old
They cannot rise their voices yet
But later on they will do

The juvenile
In a time where the night is so cold 
The juvenile
Has the key to the end (always believe in)
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here 
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend 

No education
We don't need no education
Telling us the right to choose
If we have no choice (No, no, no)
It's so explosive
Any day will burst into a fire 
Oh, come down and guide us
Before it is too late

The juvenile
In a time where the night is so cold 
The juvenile
Has the key to the end (always believe in)
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here 
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend

Oooh, oooh

Always and always and always believe in

Always believe in... 

The juvenile
In a time where the night is so cold
