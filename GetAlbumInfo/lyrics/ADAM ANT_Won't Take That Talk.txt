I wont take that talk from no one
I wont take that talk from no one
Inside it makes you ill
And the pity of it all you're fighting,
You don't see it anymore you're fighting
A size 12 fight in a size 10 war
I said I'd never forget you
And I didn't and I never will
Have a dance, meet a girl you dig
Acting like the second coming
Oh words are only words
Said another way
Got to stop treating people
Like they have no feelings
Stop treating people
Like they have no meaning
I wont take that talk from no one
I wont take that talk from no one
Inside it makes you ill
Soft as a mother's love
Her hands were cool and graceful
And you'll get no complaints from me
I said I'd never forget you
And I didn't and I never will
Have a dance, meet a girl you dig
Acting like the second coming
Oh words are only words
So I tell myself
Got to stop treating people
Like they have no feelings
Stop treating people
Like they have no meaning
I wont take that talk from no one
I wont take that talk from no one
Inside it makes you ill
I wont take that talk from no one
I wont take that talk from no one
Inside it makes you ill
Soft as a mother's love
Her hands were cool and graceful
And you'll get no complaints from me
