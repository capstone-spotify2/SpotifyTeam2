Lie to me, right through me
Lie to me, right through me

I don't want to hang around the graveyard, waiting for something dead to come back
I know you think you got one up on me, bet you can see something I can't
It's not love, it's just adornment, bathroom wall graffiti
A clichÃ© sprayed on a t-shirt, fortune cookie poetry

I don't want to waste a high hanging around some place I never was
Of all the reasons to feel hateful, you're the best of them

Treating me like a boyfriend
Some dumb fucking boyfriend
You're treating me like a boyfriend
Like just some fucking boyfriend

Lie to me, right through me
Lie to me, right through me

I don't want to hang around the graveyard, waiting for something dead to come back
I know you think you got one up on me, bet you can see something I can't
It's not love, it's just adornment, bathroom wall graffiti
A clichÃ© sprayed on a t-shirt, fortune cookie poetry

I don't want to waste a high hanging around some place I never was
Of all the reasons to feel hateful, you're the best of them

Treating me like a boyfriend
Some dumb fucking boyfriend
Treating me like a boyfriend
Like just some fucking boyfriend
Treating me like a boyfriend
Some dumb fucking boyfriend
Treating me like a boyfriend
Like just some fucking boyfriend

Lie to me
Lie to me

Treating me like a boyfriend
Some dumb fucking boyfriend
Treating me like a boyfriend
Like just some fucking boyfriend

Lie to me, right through me
Lie to me, right through me
Lie to me, right through me
