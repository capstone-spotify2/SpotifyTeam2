Silhouette of emptiness wrapped up in thoughts of nothing less my chest is pressed as I attempt to cross this bridge you're building
Limitations take control show your cards and watch me fall this paper heart is lost in fire but I'm not burning
I'm not burning
I'm not burning
I'm not burning

Got a misty eye on you
Thought that all your lies were true
I step aside after countless times of hurting
You watch me stepping out the light
Emotions bottled up inside
What am I to say should I float away to nothing?

I'm still searching

Vivid thoughts of metaphor I climb for air you dig your claws of course I'm sure I'm way past the point of no returning
I find my mind captive inside painting pictures black and white that's alright, that's alright I'm not burning

Ohhhh

Got a misty eye on you
Thought that all your lies were true
I step aside after countless times of hurting
You watch me stepping out the light
Emotions bottled up inside
What am I to say should I float away to nothing?

Float on by float on by float on by
Let the light winds move inside
Line by line
Monsters tread where angels hide
Float on by misty eye

Got a misty eye on you
Thought that all your lies were true
I step aside after countless times of hurting
You watch me stepping out the light
Emotions bottled up inside
What am I to say should I float away to nothing?
