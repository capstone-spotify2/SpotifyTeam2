I'm burning up, I'm burning down
I'm just burning with love
Every time I see you, yeah my heart spins round
Don't know what to do

'Cause you take me higher than I'll ever be
Pick me up, darlin' let me in
Make your move 'cause I'm ready for some action now
Lay your love on me now

Lay your love on me, give me some
Lay your love on me, yeah, yeah, give me some

Higher and higher then you take me up
You make my senses real
A burning desire just fills me up
Can't explain how I feel

'Cause you take me higher than I'll ever be
Pick me up, ohh, darlin' let me in
Make your move 'cause I'm ready for some action now
Lay your love on me now

Lay your love on me, give me some
Lay your love on me, give me some

I'm <i>[?]</i>, are you ready for some action
I'm ready now, baby
Somethin' about you causes a reaction
I've never been this alive

So give me love, yeah, give me some
Give me love, baby, give me some
Lay your love on me, give me some
Lay your love on me, give me some, yeah
