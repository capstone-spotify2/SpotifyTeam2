Coming home feels like surrender, feels like we're giving in.
When the shows are over, is there any other reason to live?

My brain is moving with a nervous energy.
It starts in the back of my head, carries down through my stomach,
legs and feet.
Nobody to call, I've got no real place to be.
You know I haven't been home in such a long time.
I'm just looking for a little bit of home right now.
I'm just desperate for a little bit of home right now.
I'm just grasping for a little bit of home right now.

Tomorrow we'll celebrate the coming of the New Year. They'll be
drinking in the bars around downtown.
You know I'll probably end up down there myself. Nobody to call, I've
got no real place to be.
You know I broke all my resolutions this year. Let's not make any
promises this New Year.
I just want to make it through this coming year.
No, I don't want to feel the same way next year.

Oh, but don't you know?
Did you think the world would bend for you?
Did you think that you could really change yourself?
Oh, before you know, it's already time to go.
It feels like you just got back into town.

Coming home feels like surrender, feels like we're giving in.
