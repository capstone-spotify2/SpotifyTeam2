<i>[Intro]</i>
Uh, They may not like me for this one
Fuck it, I got my pen and pad anyway

Mister Hood

Dear Mrs. Independent Hoes
Lookin' for ya like my lifetime depended on
You're a centerfold, every woman's inner goal
To meet in a nigga and his money long
Hey this a letter to my ex hoes
Before I start kiss my ass, X O's
Ahem, okay let's talk about a gold digger
Met her at a video shoot, go figure
Uh, well she was bad than a mothaflicker
Seen her lookin' got her number seen what's up wit her
Yeah, to make a long story short dawg
Couple days I'm sleepin, beatin the inner walls
Fell in love with it now we up in every mall
Bought her first Louis bag, she was so appalled
Not a scout but she love to watch a nigga ball
Bought her everything she had if I could recall
So couple months I got her moving in
That show money got me out of town
It got her trippin' when I'm not around
She was movin, trying to play a nigga out of bounds
Seen pictures of her and niggas I hate to found
Sad part was the bitch was trickin' off out of town
Uh, and I was too blind to see it sooner
Knew this bitch was kinda fishy like some old tuna
Took her clothes and threw em in to an old sewer
Damn, you shoulda' really seen her face then
Uh, she officially on my shit list
Uh, She pulled up on some shock shit
Uh, I'm talkin bags in the front trick
And that words to my common sense
See you ain't nothin' but a has been
I'm talking ashes to ashes

<i>[Hook]</i>
Uh, hey here's a letter to my ex's
You ain't nothin' but a has been
Uh, was only heavy when the cash in, yeah
You tried to play me like a band bitch
But I ain't trippin' cause you're pussy kinda average
Uh, her ego bigger than her ass is
Man, I'm so glad you the past tense
I used to love you with a passion
Sincerely yours, bitches

Uh, Dear Mrs. Independent hoes
Still searching like my lifetime depended on
You're a centerfold, every woman's inner goal
To meet a nigga and his money long
If you ain't got it then you can carry on
I'm talking like a Louis bag homes
No matter swagger, you're new cologne
I swear my last was a bee like a honeycomb
Uh, I thought we really woulda' last long
Shit, we were the worst to put your money on
Damn, in the beginning it was fairy tales
I'm talking make believe love coated in make believe
Uh, but that's until I started buying things
It was cool, now she started wantin wedding rings
Such a drama queen demanded all kinda things
Corrupted buy the light, she could only see the green
Wanted kids so I can be there by any means
Let her tell it we were something like a perfect team
Damn, had to cut it, she was out of order
Tryin to put me on blast like a bill boarder
Yeah, I called her momma tried to transport her

"Did you throw out her out dawg"

Yeah kinda sorta, she was mad so she filing a restraining order
Just to come and get her bags in the trash house
Swear the cops made me leave nearly passed out
Hey but I end up moving back in
Oh my momma, now she preggo with a set of twins
Pause, "That's a whole lot to settle in"
Uh, I guess the story really never ends
Well here's a letter to my ex then
I swear she used to be my best friend
Now she's a memory from back then
I know she prolly misses that fifth
Big sprees, and them motherfuckin plane trips
And she the last on my ex list
Nearly had a nigga stressed

Damn

<i>[Interlude]</i>
Somebody tell me what's love
What's your definition of love?
Is love buying one another different gifts
"Depending on the price tag."
Is that love?
I mean a nigga just looking for somebody genuine
To really ride for him
I'm feelin' like "fuck love,"
They don't give a damn about me anyway
Maybe relationships ain't for me
I guess that's why I'm writing this

Uh, hey here's a letter to my ex's
You ain't nothin' but a has been
Uh, was only heavy when the cash in, yeah
You tried to play me like a band bitch
But I ain't trippin' cause you're pussy kinda average
Uh, her ego bigger than her ass is
Man, I'm so glad you the past tense
I used to love you with a passion
Sincerely yours, bitches
