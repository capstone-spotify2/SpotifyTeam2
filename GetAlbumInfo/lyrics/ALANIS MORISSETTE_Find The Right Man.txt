You found the right man in the right place
Once in a while you meet him face to face
It was love at first sight
Honey you've gotta fight for his love, for his love
He feels the same way, I think you know it
You can't be afraid to show it
When will this hidden emotion
Give you the notion'
To make the first move
Make the first move
You gotta get it straight
Oh dear don't wait
This might be your lucky day
Don't say that there's no way
Darling you just can't let him go
Deep down in your heart you can't feel at all
I'll be calling all there is
For his love, for his love
You know you can take his heart away
Just look straight in his eyes
And then you say
Hey can't you just see
We'll be great you and me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You gotta get it straight
Oh dear don't wait
This might be your lucky day
Don't say that there's no way
You found the right man in the right place
Once in a while you meet him face to face
It was love at first sight
Honey you've gotta fight for his love, for his love
It was love at first sight
Honey you've gotta fight for his love, for his love
It was love at first sight
Honey you've gotta fight for his love, for his love
It was love at first sight
Honey you've gotta fight for his love, for his love
