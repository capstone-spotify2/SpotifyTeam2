In just about any given situation, 
I'm wasting my patience.
Even though my heart is open,
I'm broken, so broken down

I defy the laws of science,
And physics, well even logic
Come on, let's erase my existence;
Annihilation, exuberating

Feel it running on and on
I've broken down

I'd swear my mouth is open
It's open; I'm screaming
But still my world is silent
So silent, so alone

No more decaffeinating
I'm done procrastinating
Consider this my resignation

Everyday, everyway, always losing my mind
Spinning round in rhetorical questions 
Perpetually wasting my given time
