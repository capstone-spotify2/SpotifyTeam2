There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story, long ago
She saw the queen of heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul

No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
But there were sorrows to be healed
And mercy, mercy in this world

So many hearts I find
Broken like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you
Won't you let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do

We've been around we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every no and then, we try
To mend the damage that we've done

Tonight, tonight I cannot rest
I've got this joy inside breast
To think that I did not forget
That child, that song of Bernadette

So many hearts I find
Broken like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you
Come on let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do

I just want to hold you
Won't you let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do
