Blessed is the luxury of the dead.
Broke, so I sold my breath.
For pennies, I am worthless.

I feel a brazen cacophony.
Of wave crushing, heart pounding, gut wrenching lonely.
I paid the voices, you scream so loud.
Subscribe to the medicine show.
Where the walls melt away and my doctors so proud.

Bring me pain, bring me horror.
I'm not sick, I'm not insane.
Asylum hospital colder.
Fuck you and all of your friends.

I stand on the threshold of death,
Where my torture and beating,
Subsides for a moment.
I pay the price for eating rats.
Subscribe to the medicine game.
Where the walls melt away and the world has gone mad.

Bring me pain, bring me horror.
I'm not sick, I'm not insane.
Asylum hospital colder.
Fuck you and all of your friends.

My blood is cold as this snow.
And cobblestone I tread upon.
I'm fucking sick, don't take me.

Bring me pain, bring me horror.
I'm not sick, I'm not insane.
Asylum hospital colder.
Fuck you and all of your friends.
