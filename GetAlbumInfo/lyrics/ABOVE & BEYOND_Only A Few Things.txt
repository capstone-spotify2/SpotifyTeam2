Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die

So if I cannot tell you
If the words I do not find
I want you to know
There are only a few things
That I will be carrying
In my memory when I go

Only a few things will we recall
With true happiness, with gratitude
Only a few things
I see you ~
I see you ~

You ~ you were the joy in my life
The one who loved my tired bones
The one who came to stay

So if I do not tell you
If I don't find the words
It is NOT because I don't feel it in my heart
You're the one who loved my tired bones
You're the one who took me home

You ~ you brought joy to my world
So I will tell you now
In case you don't know
That you'll be with me
When I go

Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die
