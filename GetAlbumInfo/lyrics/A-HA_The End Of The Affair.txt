Even as the snow is falling
Dark December nights are calling
Memories of early warning signs
Like a whisper in the mind
I put my brave face on
Robbed of the love I owned

Itâs the end of the affair
We are not who we once were

Hard to be open when all facts are in
Hard to write endings before we begin

Itâs the end of the affair
And it seems we no longer care

Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Well I was fond but now Iâm harder
So here we are in somber silence
With no one else but us to blame

Hard to be honest when others pretend
Hard to begin when we already know the end

Itâs the end of the affair
And it seems we no longer care
