Oy, Manuel
Yo keep the car runnin' man
I got some shit I gotta handle real quick man
Yeah, what the fuck is good
You know I'm back in the motherfuckin' room
Just stepped in, matter fact I just stepped out
Motherfuckin' 1996 Lincoln Town Car, baby blue
But now I'm over here making my presence felt once again
'Cus you know I'm a made motherfuckin' man
The first thing you do when you meet me
You should apologize to me straight off the top
Just because you're nothing like me
But fuck that, back to me
