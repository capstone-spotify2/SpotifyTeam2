You and I what a wild ride
Feels good to hold you close
We survived through the turbulent highs
And the struggles down below

And now
I give myself to you now
Yeah I give myself to you

It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
I'm forever yours
It's the way that you move me
You give yourself to me
I'm forever yours

On this day as we stand face to face
With the ocean in your eyes
And you say "this is love no more pain"
It's a reflection of our lives

And I do
Give myself to you I do
Yeah I give myself to you

It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
I'm forever yours
It's the way that you move me
You give yourself to me

I'm forever yours

And even if we lived
For a thousand years
Nothing no one
Would come between us

When the waters rise
We will sail away
To some place
And start again

It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
I'm forever yours
It's the way that you move me
You give yourself to me
I'm forever yours

It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
I'm forever yours
It's the way that you move me
You give yourself to me

I give myself to you
I give myself to you
I give myself to you
I give myself to you
