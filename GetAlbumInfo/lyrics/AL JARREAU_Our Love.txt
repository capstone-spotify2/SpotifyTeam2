There's a land where lovers dream,
Where poets dwell.
We can sail tomorrow.
There is always room for one
Who wishes well.

There are doubters who 
will be welcome too.
When you can't afford the fare,
There's a wish to borrow.

Our love, we must never doubt it.
Our love, when you think about it.
Love like our's will live a thousand years.

Yes, I know you've heard the story
Without end.
And you're uninspired.
Still, a walk without a wish
Cannot begin,
If you wish at all,
We can conquer all-
Learn to walk and run again,
As we chase Goiath.
