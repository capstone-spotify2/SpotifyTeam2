I'd walk a thousand miles to you
If I had no other way
And tell you how I feel
If I could find the words to say
I'd build you up a temple
Keep you safe inside
When everything's upon you
It will be your place to hide

And now with you I know
Sometimes the very thing you run from
Is that thing you need the most

You know I'd die for you
These words I swear are true
Just when I'd given up
You showed me the meaning of love
There's nothing I won't do
I'd steal all the stars for you
Just when I'd had enough 
You showed me the meaning of love
Of love

I crossed all seven oceans
And I fought a hundred wars
But through the sea of faces
It was fate that brought me yours
I built these walls around me
My heart safe inside
But your wave crashed upon me
What was lost you helped me find

Once bittersweet and lonely
Now I feel alive

You know I'd die for you
These words I swear are true
Just when I'd given up
You showed me the meaning of love
There's nothing I won't do
I'd steal all the stars for you
Just when I'd had enough 
You showed me the meaning of love

I've opened my eyes
Let in your light
I've run out of time
You keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging on

You know I'd die for you
These words I swear are true
Just when I'd given up
You showed me the meaning of love
There's nothing I won't do
I'd steal all the stars for you
Just when I'd had enough 
You showed me the meaning of love
Of love
