Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I did buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
But I did pick up the baby this mornin' at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress

I'm sorry I got mad waitin' in the truck
It seemed like hours you gettin' all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's  on a Wednesday night
I read taht book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's sinkin' in but i probably need to reread it
But I'm startin' to see now what you've been sayin' is right

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
But that low fat, no fat's gettin' hard to chew
Now I love your cooking honey
But sometimes I need some real food

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progress
