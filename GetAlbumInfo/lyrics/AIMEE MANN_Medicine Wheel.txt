The day you left and you called me bitch
I called you selfish, better pull that switch
Put my son on amphetamines
He came home crying and there's your proof
Crying 'bout nothing but a missing tooth
I did the right thing.

You shade the truth almost everyday
Phone calls at night âit's going to be okâ
Are you saddened, baby, under the bridge?
Are you saddened, baby, on Lake Street?

Black marker on cardboard
Little drawing of a medicine wheel
But everything that's good you steal
Everything that's good you steal

Maybe you'll wake up in jail alone
And hold the handle of the one pay phone
And do the right thing
Like I once tried but I bent the truth
A five dollar dent for a little lost tooth
There's a payback in front of me
Because once you were like a walking high
Breaking in motion through the parking lot

Are you saddened, baby, under the bridge?
Are you saddened, baby, on Lake Street?

Black marker on cardboard
Little drawing of a medicine wheel
Everything that's good you steal
Everything that's good you steal

Words of encouragement are just as real
Saving my faith does have a smooth group appeal

Are you saddened, baby, under the bridge?
Are you saddened, baby, on Lake Street?

Black Marker on cardboard
Little drawing of a medicine wheel
Everything that's good you steal
Everything that's good you steal
Everything that's good you steal
From me
