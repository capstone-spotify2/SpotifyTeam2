<i>[Hook:]</i>
Don't ruin yo life, don't ruin yo life
Livin in this cold world, niggas dyin by the night
Everyday another struggle, we just gotta keep fightin
Lil nigga, lil nigga

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Hunnit round on the backseat
Catch a nigga slippin on the back street
Big fire loaded and it's ready
Homies get it runnin like a track meet
Young nigga tryna catch a body
He don't even know what he started
He don't give a fuck about nothing
Trappin every day to Yo Gotti, fuck it!
Horny 15 and they fuckin
Projects livin with his cousin
Mama on drugs and his daddy don't care
Got a dirty glock boom, he a bust it
And them lil niggas sellin trees
Steady he enlist with the fiends
Never follow rules and he barely go to school
Drug test him and he wasn't even clean
Lil nigga, lil nigga

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Don't ruin yo life, don't ruin yo life
Livin in this cold world, niggas dyin by the night
Everyday another struggle, we just gotta keep fightin
Lil nigga, lil nigga

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
All a young nigga know is murda
Always know he's standin on the corner
Big homie givin in the game
Started with a ounce and a burner
Fuck nigga runnin round lurkin
Extend in the clip so 30
Creepin real slow in a reaper
See a nigga peepin through the curtain
Hold up, lil nigga fuckin up his life
He just wanna earn some stripes
Send him out shootin at another motherfucker
When he see him man he says on sight, damn
He don't really playin for the set
He'd do anything for a check
It's only two ways he gon end up goin
Either prison or he's fuckin round dead
Lil nigga, lil nigga

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Don't ruin yo life, don't ruin yo life
Livin in this cold world, niggas dyin by the night
Everyday another struggle, we just gotta keep fightin
Lil nigga, lil nigga

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
4-5 niggas in a rental
Duck boy, tints on the window
Catch a few niggas at the corner store chillin and they plottin on how they gon kill em, man
Lil nigga with em like fuck it
Roll up on them niggas, start jumpin
Before they even know it everybody hit the ground
Goddamn it's like they seen this shit comin
Woa! Smash on the gas, nigga hurry
Heart beatin fast, niggas worried
Never leave evidence, never leave fingerprints on a car these niggas so dirty
Black car caught them at a light
They ain't even know it
6 masked goonies and the clips on fully
Hot dog and they startin unloadin

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Don't ruin yo life, don't ruin yo life
Livin in this cold world, niggas dyin by the night
Everyday another struggle, we just gotta keep fightin
Lil nigga, lil nigga

Don't ruin yo life, don't ruin yo life
Lil nigga, lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga
