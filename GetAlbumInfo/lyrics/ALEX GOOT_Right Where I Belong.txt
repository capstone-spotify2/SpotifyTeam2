I was lost, but now I see
Just let it the rain on me
I'm right where I belong
And the truth will set you free
It's too bad I don't believe
I'm right where I belong
I think I've fallen and I can't get up
No I can't up this time
So I'm head back to the city of angels
When my life was plain and simple
My flag is up I surrender
We're here the plane is landing
I'm right where I belong
I wanna go where nobody knows me
And burn up in a blaze of glory
My flag is up I surrender
We're here the plane is landing
And I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Too many days, I kinda tripped here
But now I'm getting up
I'm right where I belong
And I'm letting go
Doing my best, but it's not good enough
I'm right where I belong
Cause I have finally fallen and I can't get up
No I can't up this time
So I'm headed back to the city of Angels
When my life was plain and simple
My flag is up I surrender
We're here the plane is landing
I'm right where I belong
I wanna go where nobody knows me
And burn up in a blaze of glory
My flag is up I surrender
We're here the plane is landing
I'm right where I belong
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
I'm right where I belong
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
And I'm right where I belong
