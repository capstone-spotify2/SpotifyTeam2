You're miles away and loving me better
And I'm thinking you should stay there forever
'Cause I've seen a side of you that I'd never known
(I love the way)

Middle of the night I was thinkin' about you
Must've read my mind 'cause you lit up the room
When the telephone rang and I saw your name
The butterflies came and stayed till morning

You playing me a song, said you wrote it about me
I'm trying to sing along, but the static is crazy
I'm loving the way you keep me waiting
I'm starting to like the distance, baby

You're miles away and loving me better
And I'm thinking you should stay there forever
'Cause I've seen a side of you that I'd never known
And I love the way you miss me
You miss me <i>[x3]</i>

Staring at the ink 'cause I like what I'm reading
27 things you've been missing about me
Look what you've done, you got me hanging
I'll never reword it, I can't explain it

All the times that I didn't think you were listening
I didn't realize you needed space, not convincing
Starting to think you've finally got it
The fairytale love I've always wanted

You're miles away and loving me better
And I'm thinking you should stay there forever
'Cause I've seen a side of you that I'd never known

And I know you'd rather us be together
But it's nice to feel the love in your letters
And maybe you shouldn't come back home
And I love the way you miss me
You miss me <i>[x4]</i>

It's not that I don't want you here
But when you're gone, you feel so near
I'm starting to think you finally got it
Fairytale love I've always wanted, yeah

You're miles away and loving me better
And I'm thinking you should stay there forever
'Cause I've seen a side of you that I'd never known

And I know you'd rather us be together
But it's nice to feel the love in your letters
And maybe you shouldn't come back home
And I love the way you miss me
You miss me <i>[x4]</i>
