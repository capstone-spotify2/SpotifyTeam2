Write a song, know it 
Overkill just a bit 
Easy does it 
Good and hard just may hit 

Oh you see this working 
You and me been hurting 
All this time we're being spun 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 

Drummer bleeding 
It's his pulse you're feeling 
Singer screaming 
Words you been feeling 

Oh you see it working 
You and me been hurting 
All the time we're being spun 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 

Drummer bleeding 
It's his pulse you're feeling 
Singer screaming 
Words you been feeling 

Oh you see it working 
You and me been hurting 
All the time we're being spun 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 

Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung 
Just to sing song 
Sing song sung
