Baby
you better get some sleep while you can
You can't fight fate and a 15 passenger van
The businessmen sleep in their hotels tonight
but you're wide awake by the blue cell phone light
trying to make everything right

Baby
No one can keep their demons at bay
At some point you're gonna give your secrets away
I see what goes on but I don't say a word
It's none of my business what dreams you've deferred

And you will do just what you always do
Close your eyes and let her run to you
And I know cause I'd run to you too

So baby
put back the seat and turn off the phone
Tomorrow you can go back to being alone
Baby I love you, what more do you want
those that can't hurt you and ghosts that won't haunt

And you will do just what you always do
Close your eyes and let her run to you
And I know cause I'd run to you too
