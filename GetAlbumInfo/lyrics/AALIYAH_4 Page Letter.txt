<i>[Intro]</i>
Yo Turn My Music Up
Up Some More
Up Some More
Up A Little Bit More

Mama Always Told Me To "Be Careful Who I Love"
And Daddy Always Told Me, "Make Sure Hes Right"
I Always Had My Eyes, On This One Particular Guy
I Was Too Shy, So I Decided To Write

I'm Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.
And When I Write Him He Better, Get It On Time.
Im Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.
And When I Write Him He Better, Get It On Time.

People Always Say That I Play Myself For You.
They Say That You Dont Even Notice Me(Echo)
Maybe When I Get The Nerve To Come To You.
Promise Me That You Wont Diss Me.

Im Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.(A Kiss)
And When I Write Him He Better, Get It On Time.(He Better)
Im Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.
And When I Write Him He Better, Get It On Time.

Ima Write You, A Love Letter Tonight(echo)
You Better keep Watch Cause The Mail Mans Coming.
Ima Write You, A Love Letter Tonight(echo)
You Better keep Watch Cause The Mail Mans Coming.

Im Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.(A Kiss)
And When I Write Him He Better, Get It On Time.(He Better)
Im Sending Him A 4 Page Letter,
And I Enclosed It With A Kiss.(A Sweet Kiss)
And When I Write Him He Better(When I Write), Get It On Time.
