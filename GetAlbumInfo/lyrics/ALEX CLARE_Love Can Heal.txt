Been here before,
And you said the repetition's the same
'Cause it ain't nothing new
Nothing new under the sun
But this time we felt the change
All the lost emotions invested in places of foolish notions
Coming apart when we fall together

I've been burned by love
Deep as the ocean
I've teared all my tears
So cool my spot
Breaking off till twice as fast
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal

Don't be cynical,
Protect the brand, the immaterial
If it works alright, it's worth the fight
I would drown in the sadness
Covered in <i>[?]</i>
We fall apart when we come together

I've been burned by love
Deep as the ocean
I've teared all my tears
So cool my spot
Breaking off till twice as fast
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
Love can heal
