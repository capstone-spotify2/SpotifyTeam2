Sex is the reason that I tried
Hope I have you believing that you're my type
And all I wanted was a one night thing
She said I know it's just a one time thing

She won't tell the world just what we did
I just wanted to tell it's what it is
Lick your lips and twirl your hair
Your hair

Dig a little more, just a little kiss
You know you'll like this baby
I want a little more, just a little dip
'Cause that's electric lady
I know you like what I do
I know you like to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used

She's been tellin' me all the thing she likes
Whispering what she's great at and what she would try
And all I wanted was a one time thing
And all she wanted was a little day dream

She's not telling her girls just what we did
I don't want the world to know what it is
Licked your lips and twirled your hair
Licked your lips and twirled your hair
Your hair

Dig a little more, just a little kiss
You know you'll like this baby
I want a little more, just a little dip
'Cause that's electric lady
I know you like what I do
I know you like to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used

You're gonna use me?
I'm gonna use you
You're gonna use me?
I'm gonna use you
I'll fucking use you!

Dig a little more, just a little kiss
You know you'll like this baby
I want a little more, just a little dip
'Cause that's electric lady
I know you like what I do
I know you like to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used
Sometimes you're meant to get used
I'm fuckin' usin' you
