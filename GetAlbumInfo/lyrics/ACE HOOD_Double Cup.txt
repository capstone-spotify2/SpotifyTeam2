<i>[Intro:]</i>
Double cup and I'm leanin' <i>[x3]</i>
Fuck these niggas I mean it

<i>[Hook: x2]</i>
Double cup and I'm leanin' (I said it)
Double cup and I'm leanin' (I said it)
Double cup and I'm leanin' (I said it)
Fuck these niggas I mean it

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Okay now, Purple stuff in my styrofoam
Sippin' slow while they blowin strong
All I need is my dirty sprite
All I need is her super-dome
Drank'd up and I'm dripped out
Caked up and my pistol out
Bad bitch and she thick as fuck
And I'm tryna see if what pussy bite
Bust it open for a real nigga
Bust it open for a trill nigga
Touchdown, whattup? H-Town
Long live the Pimp, this one's for you!
Bun B, my nigga Trae The Truth
Still in the coupe and I'm double dueced
Still in the hood on that purple, fool
Better know what I'm drinkin' ain't grape juice!
I be flowin' through the city, let my chain swing!
How you live, a young nigga tryna maintain
Get money, fuck lames, all my little niggas on the same page
Spend racks when I'm up in <i>[?]</i>
Gimme head she gon' catch this semen
Hatin on me? Nigga, so what? Ya know what?
Hold up...

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2: Bun B]</i>
Gangsta nigga, I'm bout it
I'm Trill as fuck so don't doubt it
Tell me what's the haps, cause you know I'm strapped
A nigga never leave home without it
I'm posted up in that Caddy
I'm twistin' up a big fatty
And it's full of dro, and I'm a mack your ho
And you know she callin' me daddy
I'm a trill OG and I earned it
That G code, nigga I learned it
So when I saw the dough they had for me bro
I just grabbed the knob and I turned it
I wanted bread so I chased it
And I got so close I could taste it
I played the deck and got my respect
So nigga I'm the king, now just face it
I'm in the house and I'm chillin'
My mind on cash and I'm willing
I'm on the paper chase, no time to waste
So I could give a fuck how you feelin'
I'm sideways on that buck
My seats is stitched and they tough
You ain't down with that?
Then I'm hide your head in your ass
And be outta luck, wassup?

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]</i>
Well it's that young nigga from the Southside
Of that USA I need <i>[?]</i>
Lotion cause a nigga used to bump
A nigga came from nothing to saying nevermind
To the pretty girls in the magazine
Your girlfriend look like Maxim
A phone book full of Billy Jeans
<i>[?]</i> Came out that limosine
I been a fan for that Codeine
Since Martin Luther was like 13
Fuckin' queens cause I'm a king
Put 5% on everything
I done threw 10 on top of 10
Bump a kit, I bump a kit
Threw my last bitch on my new bitch
And threw ten on my fuckin' dick
I done came down, hold it down for that H-Town
I'm a take the crown
Sippin Hen, don't fuck with Crown
But I'm a just drop this 4th of 9
And free my cousin that doin' time
I'm a pay the lawyer
But I hope he dyin'
Hold it down for a real nigga
Young Kirko, young trill nigga
