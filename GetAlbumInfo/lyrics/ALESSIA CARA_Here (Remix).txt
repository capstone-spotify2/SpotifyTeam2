<i>[Intro - Isaac Hayes:]</i>
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

<i>[Verse 1 - Alessia Cara:]</i>
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

<i>[Chorus - Alessia Cara:]</i>
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

<i>[Verse 2 - Logic:]</i>
Tell me they love it, they want me, they need me
Surrounded inside of this room by the gritty
It seems like these women is needy
But all they've been wanting and needing is money
She calling me honey, I know that she lying
And all she want from me is everything high end
The ladder, the ladder, she love it, she climbing above it
The higher she gets, she gets no vision from it
The second she plummets she's gon be right here
The second she plummets she's gon be right here
At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds forever but never explain
That the diamonds filling up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Bridge - Alessia Cara:]</i>
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl talking bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand offish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking, awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

<i>[Chorus]</i>
