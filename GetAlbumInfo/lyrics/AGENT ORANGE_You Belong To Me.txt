(i can change anything)
you're all alone - just staring at the phone
as if you're reaching out to dial my number
i hear your voice - i hear you call my name
you know i only want to change your destiny

you know - you belong to me

hang up and then - it rings again
this time i know it's you - no, i won't answer
unplug the phone - i want it to be known
i need a chance to cause a new catastrophe

you know - you belong to me
