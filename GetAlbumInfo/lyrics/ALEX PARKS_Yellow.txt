Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, all the things I've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
'Cause you know for you, I bleed myself dry
For you, I bleed myself dry

It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
