Bridges always burn
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i>

Why they hating on me for?
Why? Cos I got potential and
I got the mental to be one of the greatest alive
And y'all want a piece of the pie
And they wanna seek and divide
But where was you where when I needed advice
And not when the money arrived
So many tears that I had to cry
Got me finessing I'm tryna to survive
So much invested can't get back the time
Word to my family I gotta provide
I'm on the grind grind grind grind
All of the time time time time
I seen friends change when the cash came
In the court room giving all names
Where your loyalty lie when the time comes?
Can't be loyal to the wrong ones
Find out later it was never love
Never know who you could ever trust
I got my eye on the prize
I put my pride to the side
I put my faith into God
I put my time in the grind
I got the real for you liars
Pray for my enemy minds
They wanna tempt me at times
But I am too <i>[?]</i> inside

Bridges always burn, bridges always burn
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i> you that I fuck with
What goes around comes right back around
Momma never raised no fool
That is not what she birthed
Recognizing my worth
I spit the real in these verses
I am nowhere near perfect
But I know that I'm worth it

Fuck bout a hater you miss me with it
2016 is a new beginning
I got a whole lot of weight on my shoulders
My momma just told me I'm built for winning
Got the mind frame and my soul right
Never go back to my old life
Brand new ferrari the turn pike
My and my niggas ain't looking back
Its a damn shame if you ever doubted
I be laughing to the bank about it
Told you niggas I'm the fucking realest
Said that I meant it I seen the vision
Too bad I don't get the recognition
Too bad I'm nowhere near being finished
Too bad I'm whipping that new edition
That be the reason she pay attention
Hear them talking down but I never ever listen
I don't ever listen, I don't ever listen

Bridges always burn, bridges always burn
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i> you that I fuck with
What goes around comes right back round
Momma never raised no fool
That is not what she birthed
Recognizing my worth
I spit the real in these verses
I am nowhere near perfect
But I know that I'm worth it

I am too motivated, I got it orchestrated
She gon' be cultivating
I am so elevated
Please don't be devastated
I was very patient I was too sedated
I was being accomadating
Fuck all that humble I'm infiltrating
Fuck all that humble I'm infiltrating
Fuck it, niggas all good when you doing better
Just don't do better than them
They might just cover the rim
They hate when you ball in the gym
But I will not let one of you fuckboys ever stop me
Excuse my language now
Not here to be famous I wanna be legendary
My flow is a cemetery
You sweeter than February, nigga

Bridges always burn, bridges always burn
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i> you that I fuck with
What goes around comes right back round
Momma never raised no fool
That is not what she birthed
Recognizing my worth
I spit the real in these verses
I am nowhere near perfect
But I know that I'm worth it

Bridges always burn
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i> you that I fuck with
What goes around comes right back round
Bridges always getting burned
Tables always turn
What goes around comes right back round
Monday night and I'm up
<i>[?]</i> you that I fuck with
