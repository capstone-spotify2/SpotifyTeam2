I woke up early in the morning and you weren't there
I woke up early in the morning and I could have been anywhere
But I know exactly where I am
Somewhere between making love and being friends

I tried to call you in the evening but you didn't pick up
Something about being busy, hustling just trying to make a buck
But I know that's just the way you are
Just trying to forget, but this ain't no ordinary love

When your love is safe
I'll be giving it all away
When your hope is gone
I'll be up till dawn

Something that I want to tell you that I'll never say
Sorry that I ever told you all those thinks I didn't mean inside my head
But you know that's just the way I am
Just trying to forget but this ain't no ordinary love

When your love is safe
I'll be giving it all away
When your hope is gone
I'll be up till dawn

When your love
Your love
Your love
Giving it all away
When your love
Your love
Your love
Giving it all away
