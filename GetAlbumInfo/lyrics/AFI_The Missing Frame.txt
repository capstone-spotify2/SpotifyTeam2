One at a time, constants become surreal
One at a time, heart attacks are consealed
I can see that I lose the joys of life,
One at a time.
Suicides are revealed
You will see that I lost another life

But tonight

I'll let you tear it up,
If you don't wake me up.
But if you tear it, We can't repair it.
So please don't wake me,
Til someone cares.
Now no one cares.

One at a time, I watch them all forget
One at a time, I'm lost in little deaths.
It's the place that I, I forget my life.

like tonight.

I'll let you tear it up,
If you don't wake me up.
But if you tear it, We can't repair it.
So please don't wake me,
Til someone cares.
Now no one cares

Will the flood behind me,
Put out the fire inside me,
Will the flood behind me,
Put out the fire inside me,

I'll let you tear it up,
I'll let you break it up,
If you don't wake me up.
But if you tear it, We can't repair it.
So please don't wake me,
Til someone cares.
Now no one cares.
Cares,

Oh!

I'll let you tear it up
If you dont wake me up
Cause its apparent
That you dont care and
It sunk into me
Cause I Don't care
Now no one cares.
