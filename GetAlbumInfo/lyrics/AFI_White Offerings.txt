If I were only
If I were only here I'd try
I'd try to give you paper birds I've made
Oh, everyone takes flight never to return again

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

If I were only
If I were only here I'd try
I'd try to gift you paper birds I free
And you'd set fire to my sky
Oh, but I will offer you

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

I can feel your color changing
I can feel your color changing
I can feel your color changing
I can feel it change

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

White
White room
White room
White offerings are all I bring
I offer you this white room
