Here's my keys
I want you to take them
I think I'm gonna need you, to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I dont want to loose it
I couldnt stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin
I think you'll understand why

Tonight
I'm the designated drinker
I just lost
The one who wrapped me 'round her finger
I need to get
To where I can't think of her
So, tonight
I'm the designated drinker

I came here, to get you to help me
I need a friend, to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know
I 'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrows
I may hate myself tomorrow

But Tonight
I'm the designated drinker
I just lost
The one who wrapped me 'round her finger
I need to get
To where I can't think of her
So, tonight
I'm the designated drinker

We need to get
To where we can't think of her
So, tonight
We're the designated drinkers

Woah tonight
We're the designated drinkers
