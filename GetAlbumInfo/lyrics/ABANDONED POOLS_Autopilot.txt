Where did you go?
Were you killed in the war?
A casualty of a different sort
Some kind of hurt
You dove head first down through trap doors
You pulled the cord to break your fall
You made escape without a scratch
Or so it seemed
The wounds went deeper

Pull yourself together
It's your son here
Pull yourself together for me

Where did you go?
When we needed you
More than a ghost in the shell of a home
It's not your fault
You don't deserve a tragic end
A solitary homeless king
Surrounded by your piles of junk
It's all you have in a fortress sunken

Pull yourself together
It's your son here
Pull yourself together for me

Where did you go?
