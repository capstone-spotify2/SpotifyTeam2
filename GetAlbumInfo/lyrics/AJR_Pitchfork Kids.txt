I didn't know her, couldn't hold her, bones didn't settle in
She's gotta have it, gotta have it; oh with her hipster friends

Ooh, ooh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid.
Ooh, ooh, and there's more where she lives.

And why should I spend time running for my life?

And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids

Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live.
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids

The moon is upon us, gaining on us.
She's crossed there, to stay.
We had to part, couldn't break her heart 'cause their blood pumps through her veins

Ooh, ooh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid.
Ooh, ooh, and there's more where she lives

And why should I spend time running for my life?

And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids

Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live.
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids

Ooh

And why should I spend time running for my life?

And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids

Ooh, ooh, it's the loneliest life that we live.
Ooh, ooh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
