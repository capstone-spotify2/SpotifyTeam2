Hold me tight
This is a lonely night 
And I've hurt you baby 
Because you are my light 
Make me strong 
Just like you make me weak 
When your hands reach out for me 
Even in your sleep

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours 
It won't be long now
Forever not yours 

Memories they keep coming through 
The good ones hurt more 
Than the bad ones do 
The days were high 
And the nights were deep 
And I miss you baby
I miss you baby

I'll soon be gone now
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours
I'll soon be gone now
It won't be long now 
Forever not 
Forever not yours
I'll soon be gone now 
Forever not yours
It won't be long now 
Forever not yours 
I'll soon be gone now 
Forever not yours 
It won't be long now 
Forever not yours
