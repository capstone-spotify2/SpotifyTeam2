<i>[Intro:]</i>
You can't change the world until you change yoself
Gotta start somewhere
Save us

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
There's a war going on outside, it's devastating
The hood's segregated by cliques and affiliations
City full of satans who facin no limitations
Turnin on the news and it's poison throughout the nation
Kids being kidnapped, teens getting shot up
Murder rate higher, continue as bodies pop up
Streets done got worser, the world done got colder
Many crying out and they could really use a shoulder
Amen amen, live a life full of sin
I inspire the people, the boost desire within
Got a message for students, teachers won't let me attend
Paint a horrible image of me, I'm quick to defend
What the fuck am I to do cus I'm simply speakin truth?
We gotta guard the youth, no excuses to be in school
Babies out in Africa prayin for a pair of shoes
More food or finer things they never knew
Lord knows I won't change, life's better
God bless the souls and the spirits of Mandela
Let's do it for a cause, we are grateful beyond measures
Man with a power message behind lectures
Damn...
We livin in hell, good people
We surrounded by pure evil
It sees the deceited, we need Jesus
Please...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Save us
Won't you help me? Oh
Save us
Oh oh oh oh
Save us
Save my... baby
Save us
Help me... save my... baby
Save us
Save you

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
We all soul searching, we destined to find purpose
Living in a world with the worse and the non-perfect
But women sellin piece of their bodies and call it workin
And little girls worhipin strippers, get into twerkin
These are my assumptions, never cast judgment
Youngest on the block and they focused on mild subjects
Tryna please others' perspective that's in the public
Too opinionated, I pray that we reinstated
I wanna be that voice and that pain of them crying babies
I wanna be that live, but I hope that you fightin daily
I know I'm chosen, Lord knows it, my flow golden
Is hell here? Section 8's and wellfares
Drug addicts and bad tragic, so many tears
Black hearses, it's gotten worser throughout the years
Please save us, I'm still prayin, God's will
Innocence being killed, exactly what I feel
Lawd...
And this can't be life
Bob Marley never settled, he would fight for the right
Hands up if you believe you got a purpose in life
Shit...
Welcome to hell, good people
We surrounded by pure evil
Please keep us
It sees the deceited, we need Jesus
Please...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Save us
Won't you help me? Oh
Save us
Oh oh oh oh
Save us
Save my... baby
Save us
Help me... save my... baby
Save us
Save you

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Save us from the killers, the demons and cold hearted
Save us from ourselves, what we listen but disregard it
Keepin hope alive for the people, them ones who started
Tryna change the world for them legends in which departed
How dare you criticize me with lies that you assume?
Bad judge of characters, school in Syracuse
I am the ghetto, I am the struggle, I am the hunger
I am the pain, I do inspire, don't have to wonder
Lawd...

Save
Oh, we've got to save the babies
Your babies, my babies, our babies
One by one
Oh it's getting serious, son
It's getting serious
Oh yes it is
Oh we got to do something about it
We got to do more than just talk about it

Save us <i>[x4]</i>
Help me
Save us
Will you help me?
Save us
Save... my babies
Save my... son
Save my... save my baby!
