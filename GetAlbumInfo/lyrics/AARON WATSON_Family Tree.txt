Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my Grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory

The ol' tire swing where my little boys play
Well that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off a branch in the tank
Kissin' on you and fishing from the bank

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's the love made in the shade of our family tree
Passed down from my Granny and my Grandpa
Mom and Dad kept it safe kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot winters were long
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong

Now some are gone and some are all grown
You and me baby branched out on our own
With every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my Daddy in our little boy's eyes

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's the love made in the shade of our family tree

We've lost loved ones throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
Cause they live on in your heart and mine
So let love grow like a kudzu vine

We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's the love made in the shade of our family tree
Made in the shade of our family tree

Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my Grandpa's truck
A family that prays together is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior with all your heart and love thy neighbor
A family that prays together is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior with all your heart and love thy neighbor
