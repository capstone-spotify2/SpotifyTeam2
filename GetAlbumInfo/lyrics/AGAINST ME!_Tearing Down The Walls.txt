Mind game after mind game for the head-trip after all the shit. One step in advancement, numb to everything. Searching for the result, striving for resolution, offering no solution just more dogma for confusion. Fill you full of promise with your back against the wall; interpret a hopeless freedom where chains liberate the soul. Answers to silent questions from the idols of the dark. First present solution then we'll see about tearing down the walls... 

Health all alone you find there's nothing left to fear, with the one exception of the message they conceal. Face placed on the master you find the mirror brings disgust. From the confines of this entrapment you can justify anger as lust. Blatant disregard to the feelings within, selling your own soul condescending nature flowing within. You can hate the system search for bricks to smash the state, but what's the point of revolution when no one can relate? For the finger falls one person short, the crosshairs turned around and you cry war. First present solution then we'll see about tearing down the walls...
