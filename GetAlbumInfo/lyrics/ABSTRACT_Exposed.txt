<i>[RoZe:]</i>
People starin' at me everywhere that I go
They try to judge me when they don't even know
Don't have all my story, just what only they're told
Cause they feel they should expose

Me, for all I have and all I've gained this year
Everything I've said and all I've ever did, yeah

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
They say they know
But they don't know a thing
They say they know
But they don't know a thing

I come from a small town
So a little bit of talk gon' go round
But that's okay, I'm on my way
Never slowed down, I did it my way
Came out the town hit the highway
All for the town where my heart stay
Now I'm in the City, went overseas
And they ridin' with me
Met up with fans out in Norway
5 thousands miles from my old ways
That's a lot of distance from the old days
Lot of difference couple years make
Not a minute that I would trade
Not a second that I could change

Everything that I went through
Made me everything that I am
They say life is what happens
When you've been busy
Making other plans
I just learned who I was
Through doin' all that I done
Livin' off what I live for
And I live for what I love, yeah

They say they know
But they don't know a thing
They say they know
But they don't know a thing

I know I came a long way
From recordin' raps on a laptop in my driveway
You know I came a long way
From vengeful lyrics spewin' out of heartache
Nowadays I'm closer with my family than I ever been
Livin' in the City, got a new girl and she lovin' all of this
Got the best team, chase the best dreams, got a circle that I trust
They talk to us about makin' it, but I think I'm on the cuss
But that ain't what it's been 'bout, nah, this journey shaped who I am
They say life is what happens when you've been busy makin' other plans
Went international off of passion, oh this feels good to be alive
Lookin' out the window on the way home, so much went into that flight, yeah
