I miss counting the stars
And I miss the way you kiss me
I miss the way you touch me
I miss calling you mine
Baby you know who I am
And thereâs nobody Iâd rather dance with in the moonlight
I just want to go back

I fear the emptiness will swallow me whole
This is my confession

I am no hero and Iâm not a saint
I canât save the world
and I never asked for this
In your eyes I see the questions I donât have the answers for
Arise suspicious minds

You told yourself I was pure, certain that I would save you
But if it crosses your mind that I was saving myself
Remind yourself that Iâm dangerous!
Maybe Iâm not as honest as it seems, a siren dressed in silk
Maybe Iâm just selling a lie, a villain in disguise

I fear the emptiness will swallow me whole
This is my confession

I am no hero and Iâm not a saint
I canât save the world
and I never asked for this
In your eyes I see the questions I donât have the answers for
Arise suspicious minds

I donât know if Iâm praying, I donât know if Iâm begging
But I have to believe that someone, something out there can hear me
I have to know that there is a chance
I have to believe that I might escape this hell
I fear Iâve lost myself and I donât know the way back
the way back to what I once was
Am I Fatima? Am I Rusalka? Or am I just me? Sweet, innocent Annabel.

Star crossed lovers in strife embracing on a battlefield
Giving in to the fight, changing at the speed of light
Time to move on to another night
Time to move on to another fight

I fear the emptiness will swallow me whole
This is my confession
