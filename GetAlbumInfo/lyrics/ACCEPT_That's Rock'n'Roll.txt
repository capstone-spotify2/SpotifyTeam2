Hey, little girl - what you're doing tonight
Come, have some fun - we're gonna rock today - rock today
Playing on a stage on a Saturday night
You heavy sound is burning in your brain - in your brain

Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and feel allright
Hey, woman - dance tonight
Hey woman - don't you fight
Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and hold me tight again

Rockin on stage like a hurricane
The sound blows in your face like dinamite - dinamite
Girl, we have a party - can't move around
Give me out of your sound - I'll get you mine - get you mine

Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and feel allright
Hey, woman - dance tonight
Hey woman - don't you fight
Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and hold me tight again

That's rock 'n' roll
That's rock 'n' roll

Later in the night when the truck is on the road
Rolling on a hundred miles away - miles away
Sleeping on a seat of dirty truck
Because you have a roar the gig next day - next day

Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and feel allright
Hey, woman - dance tonight
Hey woman - don't you fight
Hey little woman - Accept tonight!
Come, rock 'n' roll and hold me tight again

That's rock 'n' roll
That's rock 'n' roll
