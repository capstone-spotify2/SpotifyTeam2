Let's raise our glass to rock and roll
May we live fast and you die old!

Every time I blink my eyes
I hardly realize how many things I've seen
I start remembering where I've been, where I'm going

The world goes racing by, my limit is the sky
Once a face in the crowd now I am facing the crowd
We are the music makers, the dreamers of dreams

Raise your glass!

Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip

When you're down I pick you up
One drink should be enough
Brothers through everything and always remembering
Where we've been and where we're going

Remember all that fear? The late nights and the tears?
Trying to do what's right while never forgetting why?
Long drives home in the sun-drenched thoughts of that first kiss

Raise your glass!

Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip

Sing along and if you're feeling reckless
Jump around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
Give yourself to music, let it control you
Give yourself to music and it will set you free

Here's to the bold
Let's raise our glass to rock and roll
May we live fast and you die slow!

A way of life that you will never understand
My heart it lives here but my home is on the road
Over and over and over again
You dream therefore I am

Raise your glass!

Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip

Sing along and if you're feeling reckless
Jump around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
Give yourself to music, let it control you
Give yourself to music and it will set you free

Raise you're glass!
