<i>[Intro: Kevin Cossom]</i>
Girl I feel like tonight gon' be a hell of a night
I don't usually say that
All this turn up in my system
And my niggas just forgive us
Sometimes we don't even know how to act
Tell me where your head at
I'll show you a good time
Why don't you show me where your bed at

<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i>
If I got your permission girl I got tell the truth
All these different women, only one I see is you
Have you up all night just like a red-eye
Already know what I wanna do
Baby let's just skip the talking

<i>[Hook: x2]</i>
Baby let's just skip the talking
Let's skip the talking, let's skip the talking
Let's get right down to business baby
Get right down to it, Get right down to it yeah

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Liquor got me talking, Kush got me faded
Quit beating around the bush, Baby we can skip the basics
Can't sit around and then act like I don't want you bad as I do
From the first time that I laid eyes I had pictured you in my Coupe
With that dress fitting perfect, handbag Birkin
I'm just trynna change your life
Them other niggas thirsty
I'm a keep it real no bullshit and I need your body like now
See we both grown and there ain't nothing wrong with a little bumping and grind
Let's skip the club in my penthouse, we won't make it to the bedroom
From the kitchen onto that couch, I'm tapping your spot to see what that do
Girl I hear your body calling
You running like a faucet
This dick will give you amnesia girl, Can't remember what started
I'm saying

<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i>
If I got your permission girl I got tell the truth
All these different women, only one I see is you
Have you up all night just like a red-eye
Already know what I wanna do
Baby let's just skip the talking

<i>[Hook x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
Don't mean to be blunt, fuck it though I'm lying
Your last man never played with it while he hitting that from behind
Or get it in in that 4 do if that Porsche seats on recline
I promise baby, I promise baby, you begging me to rewind
Girl, I'll do you like a favor, don't care we wake the neighbors
You screaming oh lord, okay Anita Baker
You dealing with a real nigga baby, won't even tell you no lie
I see the want in your eyes and it ain't no need to wasting our time
Said it's 5 in the morning, niggas still on it
Breakfast in the bed, pussy weed money
I do it Shawty, I do it Shawty, can't name one better
I'm trynna get you wetter, I've been thinking this forever
I'm saying

<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i>
If I got your permission girl I got tell the truth
All these different women, only one I see is you
Have you up all night just like a red-eye
Already know what I wanna do
Baby let's just skip the talking
