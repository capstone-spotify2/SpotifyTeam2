Time stops nothing is moving
Lines crossed, you've been abusing
Hold on to your stars before they fade

Burning outta control
Yearning seethes through soul
Hold on to your stars before they fade
Before they fade, they fade
The dark comes out you say

You can't build towers with your head in the sand
Step back, reflect, understand
You're building memories from your biggest fears
We'll hold on, we'll hold on, we'll hold on to this

You can't miss writing when it's there on the wall
Break through and claim your reward
You're building memories from your biggest fears
We'll hold on, we'll hold on, we'll hold on to this

Sharp thoughts, looks that unfold me
Charged thoughts, all that controls me
Hold on to your stars before they fade

The night air is all that surrounds us
The moon's glow, the lights will drown us
Hold on to your stars before they fade
Before they fade, they fade
The dark comes out you say

You can't build towers with your head in the sand
Step back, reflect, understand
You're building memories from your biggest fears
We'll hold on, we'll hold on, we'll hold on to this

You can't miss writing when it's there on the wall
Break through and claim your reward
You're building memories from your biggest fears
We'll hold on, we'll hold on, we'll hold on to this

Hold on <i>[x2]</i>
Strong faith and blind eyes <i>[x2]</i>
