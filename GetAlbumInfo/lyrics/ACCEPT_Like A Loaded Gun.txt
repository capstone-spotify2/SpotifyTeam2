I'm victimized and tantalized
Brutalized and chained
They'll devastate - intoxicate
They're driving me insane - forever

They regulate - investigate
Complicate my life
Everyday insanity
There's nothing going right 
I mean forget it

I've been there before
Can't take it no more

That's why I'm like a loaded gun
A man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
I'm human ammunition

They mutilate and penetrate
They masturbate my brains
When all I need for sanity
Is love to ease my pain

I'm tortured, sick and tired
I'm that weapon to be fired
Overloaded - unexploded
Don't you make me cross the final line

I've been there before
I can't take it no more

That's why I'm like a loaded gun
I'm a man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
You can pull my trigger

Just like a loaded gun
On a social collision
See my eyes - I mesmerize
Read my lips - it's time to cut the crap

I've been there before
I can't take it no more

That's why I'm like a loaded gun
A man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
I'm human ammunition

Like a loaded gun
On a social collision
Like a loaded gun
I'm ready to explode 
like a loaded gun
