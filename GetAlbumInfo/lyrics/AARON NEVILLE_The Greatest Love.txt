You have a love that buys you pretty clothes
All the fine things heaven only knows that I wish I could
You have a love that dances and sings
Swings, says all the pretty little things that a playboy should

Well, he's got money, he's got charms
And when you're walkin' on and on
It hurts me so, but I just want you to know

That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And wish the best to you, push myself aside
And that's the greatest love, oh, that you?ll ever find

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You have a love, he's got the power
To entertain each and every hour of the day and night
You have a love, he's got the ways and means
To show you all the wild scenes when the lights are bright

Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You?re free to go, oh, but I just want you to know

That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you and I push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you?ll ever find

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You're free to go, oh, but I just want you to know

That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you, push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you'll ever find

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
