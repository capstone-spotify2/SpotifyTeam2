Before the end
You're gonna love somebody
And we were just friends, but now
We've got each other
To lean on
Oh I know it was real
I know it was strong
In these arms

Before the end
You're gonna love somebody
And we were just friends, but now
We've got each other
To lean on
Oh I know it was real
I know it was strong
In these arms

Where does it begin
When you love somebody?
Maybe it's that moment when
We leave our bodies
And become
Something more than what they see
Just like the air that's in between
These arms

These arms
Before the end
These arms
Before the end
These arms
These arms
We've got each other
We've got each other
These arms
Before the end
These arms
Before the end
These arms
These arms
We've got each other
We've got each other
