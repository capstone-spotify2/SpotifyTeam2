Your down on your luck.
You just lost your truck.
You cant afford another beer.
Your credit cards donât work.
Whole world thinks youâre a jerk.
You wondering how you wound up here.

It wouldnât been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnât been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldnât been cheaper to keep her around

Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so

It wouldnât been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnât been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around

So if youâre thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
Sheâs gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose and when her lawyer gets through with you youâll have to move to Mexico.

It wouldnât been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnât been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living with an empty bank account

It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
