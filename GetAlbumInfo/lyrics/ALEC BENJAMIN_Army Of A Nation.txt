Here there is no future, here there is no time
Here you're moving backwards with your fingers on rewind
A place where there is money, a place where there is greed
To bring us all together as a happy family
But I don't think that I am ready
To live out my own life
And I don't think I know the balance, between what is wrong a right

Here we are, this ordinary life
We've come this far, but nothing turned out right
We stand, we march, we all walk the same line
We are the army of a nation, the army of a nation
American vacation, we are the army of a nation

How can you see the difference
When everyone's the same
And everything you know is just the price you choose to pay
And if you wanna go there, I hope you wanna stay
Cause once they let you in you find that there is no escape
I think I see the difference
That everyone's the same
The only alteration, only with another name
But I don't think that I'm ready to live out my own life
But I don't think I know the balance, between what is wrong a right

Here we are, this ordinary life
We've come this far, but nothing turned out right
We stand, we march, we all walk the same line
We are the army of a nation, the army of a nation
American vacation, we are the army of a nation

This ordinary life, this ordinary life, this ordinary life
This ordinary life
This ordinary life, this ordinary life, this ordinary life
And here we are, this ordinary life

We've come this far, but nothing turned out right
We stand, we march, we all walk the same line
We are the army of a nation, the army of a nation
American vacation, We are the army of a nation
