Now I know, you been cheatin' and lyin' all the time
I didn't know you were gonna be so unkind
I've been tryin' just to find out how we went wrong
But I know that I can't trust you girl anymore

Rip it out, take my heart
You wanted it from the start
You got it now, so goodbye
So rip it out, watch me cry

It's so sad, I'm not glad to be with you today
And it's bad, 'cause I can't stop the pain day by day
If I knew how to stop you, I don't think I'd try
I think it's better if we just part and don't say goodbye 

Rip it out, take my heart
You wanted it from the start
You got it now, so goodbye
So rip it out, watch me cry 

I hope you suffer

Rip it out, take my heart
You wanted it from the start
You got it now, so goodbye
So rip it out, watch me cry

Rip it out, take my heart
You wanted it from the start
You got it now, so goodbye
So rip it out, watch me cry

Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out

Rip it out
Rip it out
Rip it out
