Heartbreak on hold

I tried everything to get over you
Tryin' to make it through but nothing ever seems to work
Dead in the bed, a thousand tears were shed
You should get out my head
Nothing takes away the hurt

I can't stay here can't stay

I'm going out tonight
I'm dancing all alone (heartbreak on hold)
Close my eyes
It's time to let it go (heartbreak on hold)
I'm gonna take it to the dance floor doing it on my own
Tonight putting my heartbreak on hold (heartbreak on hold)
Heartbreak on hold

It's been so long
Since I had some fun
But no I can't run I hope the music numbs the pain
I need something to take me away
I just need a sweet escape

I can't stay here can't stay

I'm going out tonight
I'm dancing all alone (heartbreak on hold)
Close my eyes
It's time to let it go (heartbreak on hold)
I'm gonna take it to the dance floor doing it on my own
Tonight putting my heartbreak on hold (heartbreak on hold)
Heartbreak on hold

How your moving it
Sets me free
Dance away all of my memories
Not gonna let this pain take over me
Tomorrow's gonna be a new day

I can't stay

I'm going out tonight
I'm dancing all alone (heartbreak on hold)
Close my eyes
It's time to let it go (heartbreak on hold)
I'm gonna take it to the dance floor doing it on my own
Tonight putting my heartbreak on hold (heartbreak on hold)
Heartbreak on hold

Oh
(Heartbreak on hold)
Close my eyes
(Heartbreak on hold)
I'm gonna take it to the dance floor doing it on my own
Tonight putting my heartbreak on hold (heartbreak on hold)
