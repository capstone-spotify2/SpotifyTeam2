Guess it's got to the point
Where I just gotta spell this shit out for y'all, know what I mean?
See, y'all niggas hear the name Ab-Soul, right?
Y'all niggas think I'm supposed to be talkin' about mu fuckin'
The flowers and the earth or somethin' like that, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm a real ass nigga though, on everything
Lemme break it down

<i>[Hook:]</i>
I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like the blood of fallen soldiers above

You put it all together and you get Ab-Soul-
Lutely, the best, salute me or meet death
Like Gaylord Focker met the parents of his girl Martha
We're staring at you, will depart ya
Thats the 38 special
Commentary from the King author not the knights of the round table sponsor
But amongst the dopest the west coast has had to offer since the '80s crack epidemic
I play drums for the contraband
Matter of fact, hit me
King Blue you a fool for this one
I ain't even gon' spit, just drool on this one
My saliva's way liver than yours, rappers
Shut your trap 'fore I set it
Y'all gassed up like your guns, unleaded
Yeah I said it, don't chat, no telling where we headed
Close shop when I open fire
Cause Soul known to carry the cannon like Mariah
Yes I uh
Bring it to you raw and uncut
No buts like an empty ash tray, what the fuck

Matter of fact, lemme break it down for y'all one more time, look

I spread it like a virus, it'll kill you if you buy it

I'm with your girl playing games like
Who could get the highest at the Hyatt, real fun you should try it
I got her wet, I'll send her back to you to dry it
You ain't the flyest or the king of the jungle, but you lying
And I can see it through ya iris
Drink like I'm Irish, think like a genius
Fall back I'm all that like Kel and Keenan
Add a bag of chips and the baddest bitch
I'll be posing with a black in my mouth, grabbing my dick
Constipation is an understatement I ain't ever gave a shit
You know you hot when
You only get 8 bars in a song and it's still everybody's favorite
My fault, my god, I'm a problem like a broke condom
A editor just told me nobody was in my column
Top Dawg 4th wheel and I'm still ill
Open up the car door that look like a steel mill
I hotbox like cable in the hood
And I'm good like wrenches with a sentence, understood?
And if it's not I'll leave you with this
Top Notch muthafucka, like snot muthafucka, I'm sick

Don't get infected
Bitch ass niggas
T-D-E
