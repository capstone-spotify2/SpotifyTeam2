I feel so good when I spend all my time with you
I feel so safe after all weâve been going through
When Iâm looking in your eyes
I can see that you want me too
So go on, I feel so good when I spend all my time with you

When the night is gonna get to you
Weâre gonna scream my love, even dance forever
And Iâm gonna be in your groove
Iâm gonna dance with you until the night comes to an end

Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby, donât you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, itâs been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche?

I feel so good, is gonna move me so close to you
I feel so safe I could go all the way with you
When the night is gonna get to you
Weâre gonna scream my love, even dance forever
And Iâm gonna be in your groove
Iâm gonna dance with you until the night comes to an end

Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby, donât you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, itâs been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche?

Hush hush
Hush hush
Hush hush

Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche, cliche
Hush hush, baby, donât you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, itâs been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, donât you know, we are not a cliche
