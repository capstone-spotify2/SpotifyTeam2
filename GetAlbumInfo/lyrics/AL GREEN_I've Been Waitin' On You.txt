Oh baby

What's taking you so long?
I've been waiting on the phone
Oh, you haven't been home
Where have you gone?

What do you know
And where do you go
Oh, I love you so
I've been waitin' on you

Oh baby, let me hear

I got over you
You weren't real anyway
Oh, why did you say
I love you so

Before I learned my A B C
These things are true to me
Whole world to see
I've been waitin' on you, hey

Oh, baby, where did you go
I love you so, hey
Oh baby, thought you'd never go
I love you so
Where have you gone?

Where did you go?
Been calling out your name
Always the same
But I have enough to blame

Died over you
You wasn't real, no way
What did you say?
I've been waitin' on you

Hey, baby, oh

Baby, where did you go, I love you so
(I've been waitin' on you)
Got over you, oh no, it's true, oh yeah
(I've been waitin' on you)

(I've been waitin' on you)
Love you, baby, yeah
I'm gonna wait on
Waiting by the telephone
(I've been waitin' on you)

Why you ain't at home?
(I've been waitin' on you)
(I've been waitin' on you)

Waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin'
(I've been waitin' on you)
Hey, I've been waitin'
(I've been waitin' on you)
Waitin' on, waitin' on, waitin'
