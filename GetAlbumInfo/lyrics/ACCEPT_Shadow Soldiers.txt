So cold and lonely it seems so long since someone was here
Following the shadows, with the sun till it disappears
Thousands of stone white crosses, a formation for all to see
With flags and flames, the ranks and the names of those who died to be free

The fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom, we're living on thru you

We're the Shadow Soldiers, laid to rest standing tall
Shadow Soldiers, in freedom you live
That's why we've given it all

Taken too soon from the lives we loved a misery I can not explain
Only when we feel your presence are we sure we did not die in vein

The fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom, are these words, oh so true
We're living on thru you

We're the Shadow Soldiers, laid to rest standing tall
Shadow Soldiers, in freedom you live
That's why we've given it all

<i>[Solo]</i>

The fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom, we're living on thru you

We're the Shadow Soldiers, laid to rest standing tall
Shadow Soldiers, in freedom you live
That's why we've given it all

Shallow Soldiers, laid to rest standing tall
Shadow Soldiers, in freedom you live
That's why we've given it all
