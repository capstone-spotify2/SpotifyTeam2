Sunday dress so sweet and innocent 
But I can tell by the look in your eyes I ain't seen 
Nothing yet oh no 
Cause the talk of the town is you get around 
Just one touch and your dress hits the ground 
I got what you want you got what I need 
So C'mon baby let me slide it in and 

Rattle you bones 
I'm Gonna rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones 
Girl I'm gonna rattle you bones 
Tonight 

Talking sex on the telephone 
Baby dirty fingers have a mind of their own 
If ya need a helping hand baby I'm your man 
I got the touch like no other man 
You got what I want I got what you need 
So c'mon baby let me slide it in and 

Rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones 
Girl I'm gonna rattle you bones 
C'mon shake it baby 

I'm gonna rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones 
Girl I'm gonna rattle you bones 

C'mon baby 

Rattle you bones rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones rattle you bones 

I'm gonna rattle you bones rattle you bones 
I'm gonna rattle you bones tonight
