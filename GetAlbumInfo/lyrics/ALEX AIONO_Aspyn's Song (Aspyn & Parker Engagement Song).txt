You are the light I'd like to wake up to
There's not a sun that rises sweeter than you do
Moment my eyes caught the sight of you
I was surrounded by these feelings I never knew
Never knew itâd be nights alone in my car just me, you, stars and moon
Didnât think I would share so much of this heart but now itâs been built for two
No I donât see myself with anyone else
Nobody else but you

Noooo-one else but you
Noooo-one else but you

You are the light Iâd like to wake up to
Thereâs not a sun that rises sweeter than you do
Moment my eyes caught the sight of you
I was surrounded by these feelings I never knew
Never knew itâd be years to keep in the tears away from your soft green eyes
Didnât think itâd be walks the sunsets and socks of love cause it just felt right
Now I donât see myself being anywhere else
Than kneeling to you tonight

Noooo-one else but you
Oh how long would it take?
How long would it take us to find eternity?
Thereâs nothing I want more
Than you eternally
So how long would it take to make this heart complete?

You are the light Iâd like to wake up to
Thereâs not a sun that rises sweeter than you do
Everyday since our eyes met
I just couldnât wait
I couldnât wait to spend
Forever here with you
