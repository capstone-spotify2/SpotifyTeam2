I heard the sidewalk Santa say
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Salvation's coming cheap today
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

I searched the skyline for a star
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
And, baby, I wondered where you are
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

'Cause comfort's not possible when
You look past the joy to the end

Calling on Mary is voluntary
Unless you're alone like me
If there's a star above, then it can look like love
When they light up the Christmas tree

When I was young, I couldn't see
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
All that my true love gave to me
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

She offered sight to the blind
But I'm not the miracle kind

Calling on Mary is voluntary
Unless you're alone like me
If there's a star above, then it can look like love
When they light up the Christmas tree

And to all the lost souls down below
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
What's one more drifter in the snow?
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

If there's a star above, then it can look like love
When they light up the Christmas tree
If there's a star above, then it can look like love
When they light up the Christmas tree
