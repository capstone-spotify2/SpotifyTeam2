We're getting ready, here we go

We're gettin' ready to rock
Gettin' ready to roll
Gonna turn up the heat
Gonna fire up the coal
I gotta keep that motor turnin'
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tyres burnin'
I got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker
Chargin' out the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down

Getting' ready to break
Getting' ready to go
Get your shoes off an' shake
Get your head down an' blow
Ya gotta keep that woman firin'
Ya gotta keep that circuit clean
Ya gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream
Cos I'm a heatseeker
Burnin' up the town
And I'm a heatseeker
I don't, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down
Here it comes

Heatseeker
I wanna see you get up
See the whites of your eyes
I'm a heatseeker
I'm gonna measure you
Gonna try you for size
And I'm a heatseeker
Ya gotta keep that motor turnin'
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tyres burnin'
I got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker
Out on the street feel the heat
