How many times must I say I love you
How many times must I say I love you, love you
You treat me so cold honey
You opened my nose, honey
And then you laughed, uh huh, uh huh
You made me feel bad, uh huh, uh huh
You made me cry honey
I wanted to die

How many times must I say I'm sorry
How many times must I say I'm sorry, sorry
You treat me so cold honey
You opened my nose honey
And then you laughed, uh huh, uh huh
You made me feel bad, uh huh, uh huh
You made me cry honey
I wanted to die

You brought me through changes
I've never been through before
I said I was leaving but I never got out that door
I'm never at ease honey
I'm always on my knees honey
I'm begging you please, whoa to forgive me please

How many times must I say I'm sorry
How many times must I say I'm sorry, sorry
You treat me me so cold honey
You opened my nose honey
And then you laughed, uh huh, uh huh
You made me feel bad, uh huh, uh huh
You made me feel bad
I wanted to die
