She just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's botherin' me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody

I've never had any reason to doubt her
As far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eyes
I wonder if she's seein somebody new

You can't blame a body for lookin'
When there's a world of people out there
But I hope that she's not takin any closer looks
I tell ya lately frankly I've been scared

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Cuz, she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's botherin' me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody

I've got to admit I do some looking, too
But she's the only one I love
She still tells me she loves me
But I wonder if my love's enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Cuz, she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's botherin' me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody

Yeah, she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's botherin' me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody

Yeah, I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
or just the melody...
