Pick your honey up never let her go
Say you want an answer the answer isn't no
Do it any style right across the floor
And when you feel exhausted
Then you know it's time for more
I love it when you tease
And better when you pose
But I can't kiss a lipstick
Or date a pile of clothes
You really got a bod
I saw it so I know
So why the sweats and baggy clothes
Like you don't have to show
Rebob the Bebop doin' it doggie style
I wanna see you sweat that would be unique
'Cos all that really matters is your
Manners and physique yeah
Manners and physique
Manners and physique
I wanna see you sweat
That would be unique
'Cos all that really matters is your
Manners and physique
Pick your honey up never let her go
Say you want an answer the answer isn't no
When you gonna stop
Crawling on your back
Treating daily workout
Like an aphrodisiac
Now you quit the drugs
And the messing around
But you be very careful
That you don't get musclebound
You've tuned up everything
Tighter than a drum
So tell me what's the point
If you don't share it with someone
