<i>[Akon:]</i> Convict...Music...and you know we up front.

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
I see you windinâ and grindinâ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i>
Money in the air as moâ fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Donât tell, wont tell, baby say âI donât talk, Dogg unless you told on meâ - oh well
Take a picture wit me, what the flick gonâ do
Baby stick to me and Iâma stick on you
If you pick me then Iâma pick on you
d-o-double g and Iâm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yourâs is right
Rip ridinâ the poles and them doors is tight
And Iâma get me a shot âfo the end of the night
Cause pussy is pussy and baby youâre pussy for life

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
I see you windinâ and grindinâ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

<i>[Akon]</i>
Shorty I can see you ainât lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookinâ at me now what its gonâ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwinâ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree, ex-deala use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it donât mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you.

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
I see you windinâ and grindinâ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know girl

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i>
Mobbin' through the club and Iâm low pressinâ
Iâm sittinâ in the back in the smokerâs section (just smokinâ)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You canât see me, but I can see you (baby I see you) -mm
Itâs cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
Youâre rubbinâ your back and touchinâ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookinâ at me

<i>[Akon]</i>
Girl and while your looking at me Iâm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantinâ to just give you everything and thatâs kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
normally donât get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
I see you windinâ and grindinâ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i>
I see you windinâ and grindinâ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

girl...
