Oh! You better watch out, 
You better not cry, 
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why: (why)
Santa Claus is coming to town! 

He's making a list,
He's checking it twice,
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming to town! 

He sees you when you're sleeping,
He knows when you're awake. 
He knows if you've been bad or good,
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out, You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm Telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

Little tin horns, little toy drums.
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

Little curly head dolls that cuddle and coo,
Elephants, boats and Kiddie cars too.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

All the kids in Girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee.
They're gonna build a toy land town
Around that Christmas tree.

So....You better watch out, you better not cry.
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping,
He knows when you're awake. 
He knows if you've been bad or good,
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out, You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm Telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

Oh, You better watch out, You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm Telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

He's coming to town...
