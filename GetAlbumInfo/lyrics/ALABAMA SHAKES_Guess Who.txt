I can't tell you how I feel,
But I do
Those things they say can't get to me,
But they do

I don't see the sky as blue as you do
Should I fantasize there must be some way to love again?

It's been so hard for a girl like me,
It's true
People say I look just like my daddy,
'Cause I do

All I really want is peace of mind

Why is everything so complicated?
Why is everyone so infatuated?
I gather myself safely in
Until life on Earth
Looks warm again

Feeling all these feelings all the time
All I really want is peace of mind
