Diiiiirrrrrrrty!! 

My gat sounds nice 
One 
Leave your whole damn neighborhood stunned 
You better run 
I'm comin' at ya 
Duck, bob, and weave as these bullets fly past ya 
Man I'm crazy 
Puffin' on a green leaf 
Pointin' my heat 
Straight get off on bein' the street 
I'm puttin' 
One little 
Two little 
Three little holes in the back of ya dome 
You shoulda stayed home 
D-Town born and raised 
Drinkin' on a porch 
Beatin' down on strays 
Broke as fuck 
and always hungry 
Clothes on my back be dirty laundry 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Those who grip a mic are known as teachers 

I'm dusty like a ashtray 
I don't give a shit 
Got a clean ass piece though 
With a full clip 
and a small axe underneath the passenger seat 
Ready to swing it 
Best believe I'mma bring it 
Who you think ya messin' with, don't trip 
I'm a warrior 
Scalpin' all those who ain't standin on the same side 
When its all about to go down 
Fightin' with the enemy 
Puttin' them in the ground 
I bring that old school basement sound 
When all I had was a forty-five weighin' me down 
Little redskin homey in the hood 
Big pimpin' 
Ghetto fabulous in the booth bullshittin' 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Those who grip a mic are known as teachers 

"Yeah man, my girl supposed to be comin' through dog
