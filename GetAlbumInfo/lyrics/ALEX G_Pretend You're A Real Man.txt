Uh-oh, you're a honey and you're funny; 
all the girls, they never leave you alone
Uh-oh, say you only wanna see me, 
so why you looking down at your phone?
sends confessions in a text message; 
his phone is ringing to stay in touch with his exes,
Uh-oh, thought you had it all together, 
well I hate to have to say, I was wrong.

Pretend you're a real man,
Can you do that?
Can you leave the world behind and prove that:
You are a real man
And you love me
More than any other girl above me?
You will be mine 'till your ego is you don't feel inside
Pretend you're a real man
Can you be that?
I'm dealin with a boy, but baby, it's a man I need
So put away your toys, 'cause baby, it's a man I need

Uh-oh, if your mind is undecided, 
then I might decide to leave you alone
Uh-oh, can't be insecure forever
standing on the edge and dipping your toes.
All you gotta do is dive into the ocean deep
There's the life you used to live, 
and then there's one with me
Uh-oh, there's 7 billion other people, 
so I won't be ending up on my own.

Pretend you're a real man,
Can you do that?
Can you leave the world behind and prove that:
You are a real man
And you love me
More than any other girl above me?
You will be mine 'till your ego has died (not sure about this line)
Even if you don't feel inside (not sure about this line)
Pretend you're a real man
Can you be that?
I'm dealin with a boy, but baby, it's a man I need
So put away your toys, 'cause baby, it's a man I need

I won't be nobody's secret
If I am, then you can keep it
Say my name and then
shout it from the rooftops
Stand up, boy, I know it's in ya
I want back how much I gave ya
Tell all them other girls I'm with you
