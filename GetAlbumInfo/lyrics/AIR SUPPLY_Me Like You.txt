Me like you, Me like you, Me like you, Me like you

It's a sign of the times, is it more than we can handle
Watch our life going by as were searching through the channels

We all live in a different world but were all just the same
What becomes of the one without the other?
Can't you see there's an empty space? 
Written on another nameless face
We all end in the same place together

Me like you, Me like you, Me like you, Me like you

It's a sign of the times, is it more than we can handle
Watch our life going by as were searching through the scandal

Far away from the talking crowd there's a whisper passing by
Telling me that I need to be by your side
If I said I could live with you would you say that you love me too?
Anything that you want to do I'll try, I'll try

Me like you, Me like you, Me like you, Me like you
