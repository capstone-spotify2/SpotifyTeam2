<i>[Verse:]</i>
I can't escape, emotions tell the tale
It's give and take, love isn't always fair
People will stop and stare
What we've got we don't have to share

No damage done, there's more to come
And I've been dreaming so long...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I wanna hold you
I really must confess
Because I told you
You're not like the rest
Oh no!

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Now we've begun, something that's oh so real
We're in for fun, something we can't conceal
Just forget what people say
It doesn't matter anyway

No damage done, there's more to come
I've just been dreaming so long...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh no!
You're not like the rest (alright)
Listen to me baby
Girl, girl, here it comes

Every time I look at you
I know just what I want to do
No damage done, let's have some fun
I'm tired of dreaming now!

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>

I wanna hold you
I really must confess
Because I told you <i>[fades out]</i>
