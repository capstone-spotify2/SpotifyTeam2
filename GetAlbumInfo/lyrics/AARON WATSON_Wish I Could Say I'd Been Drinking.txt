Well I've done some things that I can't undo
I took your trust and I tore it into
No man in his right mind would have said it's over
Still I told you goodbye completely sober

I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse

My mama knows her baby boy knows better
It's gonna break her heart to hear we're not together
She's always said she cares so much for you
So what is she gonna say about the hell I've put you through

I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse

Even Tennessee whiskey couldn't wash away the pain
Watered down with teardrops over light Kentucky rain

I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse

I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
