There comes a time when you can't see in
There comes a time when love is fleeting
There comes a time when we all pretend
We all pretend the same
There come a time when it won't matter
And all the things that we're after
Leave us here alone together
Leave us here alone

Be my heart, be my soul, be my own
Everything we know
My head letting go
Of everything we know
Be here with me
One voice, one beat
We can escape
Escape this fate

We're living in a broken shelter
Staring at an empty mirror
No one looking back
There's no one looking back

There comes a time when love is fleeting
Define the lines worth reading
Leave us all alone together
Leave us all alone

Be my heart, be my soul, be my own
Everything we know
My head letting go
Of everything we know
Be here with me
One voice,  one beat
We can escape
Escape this fate

Say what you are, what you are, what you are
Say what you are, what you are, what you are
Say what you are, what you are, what you are
Say what you are, what you are, what you are

Be my heart, be my soul, be my own
Everything we know
My head letting go
Of everything we know
Be my heart, be my soul, be my own
Everything we know
My head letting go
Of everything we know
Be my heart, be my soul, be my own
Everything we know
My head letting go
Of everything we know
