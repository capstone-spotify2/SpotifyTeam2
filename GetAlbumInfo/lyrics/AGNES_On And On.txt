On and on 
This love I feel for you goes on and on 

This world can be a scary place 
And so much love goes to waste 
One moment everything is clear 
The next it all could disappear 

We need something to hold on to 
I wanna be that thing for you 
'Cause you're not in this all alone 
Your heart has finally found a home 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
On and on 
This love I feel for you goes on and on 
It's something you can't lose 
You're gonna find, this heart of mine 
Will stand the test of time 
On and on 
Can't you see, this is where you belong 
I've got so much to give 
Let down your guard and let these arms 
Shelter you tonight 

Words can be so hard to trust 
They made a fool of all of us 
Let your emotions be your guide 
And go with what you feel inside 

I know that what I feel is deep 
And when I play, I play for keeps 
I know that you've been hurt so bad 
But this is something made to last 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I can feel us moving 
Closer by the minute 
This is so amazing 
Have a little faith and 
Let me lead the way 
I can promise you that 

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
