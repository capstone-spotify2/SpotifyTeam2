Watching it crumble
Might have eased the hurt
Feeling it disappear
Only made worse

Pulling it piece by piece
Slicing up ribbons could dismiss
To slowly disintegrate
Could have been the perfect gift

May you feel this, while you sleep
Push the poisonous thorns in you
May you feel this while you wake
Bear your poisonous thorns

Walk into traffic
Running with open knives
Searching for mercy here
That I'm too weak to find

To take my deepest breath
I walk into the raging sea
To drown out this emptiness
It's all you have left for me

May you feel this, while you sleep
Push the poisonous thorns in you
May you feel this while you wake
Bear your poisonous thorns

I hope you feel this
I hope that you can feel this
As it's fading the darkness shifts (the darkness shifts)
This may be the perfect gift

May you feel this, while you sleep
Push the poisonous thorns in you
May you feel this while you wake
Bear your poisonous thorns

May you feel this, may you feel this while you wake
May you feel this, may you feel this while you wake
