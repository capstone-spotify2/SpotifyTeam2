With the world in the palm of his hands
Slipping through his fingers just like grains of sand 
He don't know his hourglass is losing time
Till she run out of patience and leaves him far behind 

Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will

If only she had a dime every time he's done her wrong
Or for every one wondering why she's still holding on
She could buy that rodeo and shut it down
Along with every honky tonkin' bar in town 

Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will

It may be his fault but she's still one to blame
For taking him back and playing his foolish games

Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
