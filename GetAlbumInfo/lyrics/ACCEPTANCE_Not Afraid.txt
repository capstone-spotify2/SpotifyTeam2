Not afraid of the sounds you make
Not afraid of the steps you take
Told you that troubles on its way

Didn't I think you thought we were gone
We were gone and on and on
Didn't you say that we don't belong
Don't Belong go on and on

I told you the first time...
Troubles on its way...

We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long
We're all...ready while we can
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real
<i>[2x]</i>

Didn't I think you thought we were wrong
We were wrong and on and on
Didn't I hear you singin' along
All along and on and on

I told you that troubles on its way...

We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long
We're all...ready while we can
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real
<i>[2x]</i>

This is real...

Not afraid of the sounds you make
Not afraid of the steps you take
Told you that troubles on its way

We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long
We're all...ready while we can
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real
<i>[3x]</i>

We keep movin'
Headlights last long
Ready while we can
Givin' what we feel this is real.
