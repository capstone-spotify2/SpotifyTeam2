There's more to life than happiness, we will never know
When your heart is filled with emptiness making a mess at your soul
When you're down and feeling low
Wanting to give up give up give up
Just hold your head, head high

Oh oh we've been lost here once or twice
In this pitch black room without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head, head high
Just hold your head, head high

There's more to love than wanting love, more than we could show
Maybe it's a simple as knowing when to let go
When you're down and feeling low
Don't give up give up give up
Just hold your head, head high

Oh oh we've been lost here once or twice
In this pitch black room without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head, head high
Just hold your head, head high

Just hold your head, head high
Hold your head, head high (hold your head)
Hold your head, head high (ooh Lord)
Hold your head, head high

Ooooh we've been lost here once or twice
In this pitch black room without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head, head high
Just hold your head, head high

Can't get nowhere witcha head down (can't get nowhere)
Can't get nowhere witcha head down (with your head down)
Can't get nowhere witcha head down
Can't get nowhere witcha head down 
Can't get nowhere witcha head down (you better keep your head up)
Can't get nowhere witcha head down (keep your head up)
Can't get nowhere witcha head down (singin' keep your head up)
(Keep your head up) Can't get nowhere witcha head down
