We were always together 
You knew every thought that I've had 
(and) My wish was your command 
Like a match made in heaven 
Then we took it right back to earth 
And things got out of hand 

Now I'm looking into your eyes 
I feel something I can't describe 
It's like I'm meeting someone new 
Makes me wanna' get it with you 

<i>[Refrain]</i>
Suddenly I see 
What you mean to me 
(and) What we lost is found 
Love is all around 
Do you think of me 
Like I think of you? 
Can you hear the sound? 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 

I was walking in circles 
Used to know the way 
But I couldn't find it anymore 
I felt the word out of colours 
Tried to read 
But nothing would taste the same as before 

Now I'm looking into your eyes 
I feel something I can't describe 
It's like I'm meeting someone new 
Makes me wanna' get it with you 

<i>[Refrain]</i>
Suddenly I see 
What you mean to me 
(and) What we lost is found 
Love is all around 
Do you think of me 
Like I think of you? 
Can you hear the sound? 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 

We can have the good times 
And take the bad times 
Just remember when you're down 
I will escape inside you 
You look regard you 
Baby love is all around 

Love is all around 
(Oh-oh-ooh) 

<i>[Refrain]</i>
Suddenly I see 
What you mean to me 
(and) What we lost is found 
Love is all around 
Do you think of me 
Like I think of you? 
Can you hear the sound? 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 

Suddenly I see 
What you mean to me 
(and) What we lost is found 
Love is all around 
Do you think of me 
Like I think of you? 
Can you hear the sound? 
Love is all around 
Love is all around 

(Oh-oh)
