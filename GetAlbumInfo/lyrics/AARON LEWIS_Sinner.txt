So I sit here,
In my hole,
Hope the lord can,
Come save my soul.

Cause I'm a sinner to my core,
I ask forgiveness and nothing more.

Darkness surrounds me,
I can't see,
All of the demons,
Right here with me.

Cause I'm a sinner to my core. 
I ask forgiveness and nothing more.

My eyes are open,
Now I can see,
All of the damage,
Brought on by me.

Cause I'm a sinner to my core,
I ask forgiveness and nothing more.

I'm a sinner to my core,
I ask forgiveness and nothing more.
