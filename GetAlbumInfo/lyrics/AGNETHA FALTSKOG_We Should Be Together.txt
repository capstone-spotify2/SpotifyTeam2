If I close my eyes
I can see us together, yeah, yeah
You can hypnotize me
Still I'll never forget him, no, no.

I can hear him laugh
As if he was so near,
But a photograph
Is the only thing here.

(And I think that) we should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever
I can't let it end before it has begun.

He was in and out of my life
Before I knew just what bit me, yeah, yeah
His eyes cut like a knife
Somebody tell me what hit me, mmm, mmm.

I can hear him laugh
As if he was so near,
Oh, but a photograph
It's the only thing here.

(And I think that) we should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever
I can't let it end before it has begun.

(And I think that) we should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever
I can't let it end before it has begun.

I can hear him laugh
As if he was so near,
Oh, but a photograph
Is the only thing here.

(And I think that) we should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever
I can't let it end before it has begun.

We should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever
I can't let it end before it has begun.

We should be together
We could be as one,
(And I think that) we could be forever....
