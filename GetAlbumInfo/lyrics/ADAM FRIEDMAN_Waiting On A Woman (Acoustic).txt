I got a hole in my heart that I try to fill
With the girls and the money and the ADD pills
And what I found is my life is too heavy
So I'm waiting on a woman to take this load off me
Yeah I'm waiting on a woman to take this load off me

I do my best to pretend that I feel good
I probably should never have gone to Hollywood
But there's a guy that I pray to and I believe
That he's gonna' send a woman to take this load off me

Yeah I'm waiting on a woman to take this load off me
Yeah I'm waiting on a woman to take this load off me

I'm just a man I ain't perfect
No not the first to say
That I've tried a couple of drugs
Fell in and out of love
Thought the world would always go my way
I'm not the fool I was back in 90
But I'm still waiting on a woman to take this load off me

I'm still waiting on a woman to take this load off me
I'm still waiting on a woman to take this load off me

Waiting on her, waiting on her
Waiting on her, waiting on her
Waiting on her, waiting on her
I'm still waiting on her
Waiting on her, waiting on her
Waiting on her, waiting on her
Waiting on her, waiting on her
I'm still waiting on her, waiting on her

I'm still waiting on a woman to take this load off me
I'm still waiting on a woman to take this load off me
