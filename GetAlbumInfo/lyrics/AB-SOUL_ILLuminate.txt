<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end
Up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis, living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin' but it pays great
That is until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fifth and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought
Because we are equal, who'd have thought

<i>[Hook: Ab-Soul &amp; Kendrick]</i>
They wanna share my light <i>[x8]</i>
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Now I feel like I'm runnin' laps around Jay-Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty
B.I.G. &amp; Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPoWeR on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too I'll when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though
Like Cold get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes
On P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty
The best author ever to breath
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losing no sleep
No, no at them no doors
Just know "No" if it's no dough
So high but I'm Soulo
Two cups and I sip slow
Taking my time
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show
Now let's go

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]</i>
Time and time I drop line for line
But only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine
And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me, Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to be 2Pac
But truth I give two shits 'bout
Expectations or critics hating
Shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness
The Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tip like Kinta Kunta
Black is back bitch I'm the the coupe-da
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Black, black, black, I intend to mute you
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch see the grip on my fingertip I can hold this coast together
