<i>[Chorus - Dave:]</i>
Cause girl if you wanna stay over you should keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Girl you need to keep it on the low
You want our spot to be blown?
You know my thinkingâs clearer after dark
Get the lights off thatâs the best part
And I know, that this has been a long time coming
But thereâs a twenty deep list of people who I swear wouldnât find this shit funny
If youâve got the same intentions as me, I wonât end up running
Cuz youâll keep your mouth shut, you know Iâll keep your tongue in
I donât want lies, I just want time to lay you down, get hypnotized
Making every little minute that she with me a prize, secretâs got an upside
Donât get pissed, no slammed doors, feeling good, nothing more
Girl I love what we got, you gotta

<i>[Chorus - Dave:]</i>
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Whatâs next? Iâll come by later, now youâre with your friends so
Do us a favor and delete this text
I donât fuck with the stress, look at what I got in my Guest
Itâs a pack of king papers, a bag of bad behavior, to take you away from this mess
Girl I canât fall in love with you, Iâve seen that side of me before
If you like our location under the radar, then lay low, and say nothing
If they ask Iâmma stay
Ducking them signs, open the blinds, Iâm focused on mine
Canât fuck with my mind, I donât have the time, Iâm ducking her signs
They gotta

<i>[Chorus - Dave:]</i>
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh
Keep it on the low oh-oh oh-oh

<i>[Bridge - Carter:]</i>
And you can come untie all my knots
And you can get back in to this bed of mine
