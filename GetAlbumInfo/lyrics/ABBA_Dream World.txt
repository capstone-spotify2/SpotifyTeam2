We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie
So what's the use to pretend
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy
You've got to face it, my friend

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world

Here I am, there you are
We're gonna make it together
And we've made it so far
So it can only get better

When you reach out and you say to me
"How I love you, girl"
When I hold you baby, can't you see?
It's a real dream world

You've got your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world

Here I am, there you are
We're gonna make it together
And we've made it so far
So it can only get better

When you reach out and you say to me
"How I love you, girl"
When I hold you baby, can't you see?
That's a real dream world

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world

Here I am, there you are
We're gonna make it together
And we've made it so far
So it can only get better
