I've got a window down 
I've got a road in front of me 
I've got a radio 
I got no place that I gotta be 
And it feels so fine to be killing time
And it feels so free to just shoot the breeze 
And where it's at is where I'm gonna be 
And who I am, that's the only thing that
Belongs to me 
Sunday afternoon, just hanging out 
Nothing much to do 
It's a glorious moment 
The girls walking down White Ave. 
Looking cool
And it feels so fine to be wasting time 
And it feels so free to just let it be 
And where it's at is where I'm gonna be
And who I am, that's the only thing that 
Belongs to me
Love can be over-rated and being alone 
Is just fine sometimes 
We all get lacerated
You never know when you might
Find where it's at 
Yeah where it's at
And it feels so fine to be killing time
And it feels so free to just shoot the breeze 
And where it's at is where I'm gonna be
And who I am, that's the only thing that
Belongs to me 
And where it's at is where I'm gonna be
THAT'S RIGHT
And who I am, that's the only thing that 
Belongs to me
You're where it's at... you're where it's at 
You're where it's at 
That's where it's at... that's where it's at
