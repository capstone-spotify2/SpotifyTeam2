Now I made up my mind
But it's never too late,
You can turn the tide in any conversation
You sway me when you say it that way
Oh, I imagine whatever you say.

They call you Mr. Persuasion,
'Cos you can talk me up and down
And all you do is tell me that,
That's cos' you're Mr. Persuasion,
That's cos' you're Mr. Persuasion.

Now when you're on a roll
You're a real romancer,
You got all the questions and all the answers
You sway me when you say it that way
Oh, I imagine whatever you say.

They call you Mr. Persuasion,
'Cos you can talk me up and down
And all you do is tell me that,
That's cos' you're Mr. Persuasion,
That's cos' you're Mr. Persuasion.

Now you could talk me into
Almost anything you want to,
'Cos you're Mr. Persuasion
You'd convince me day was night
You're never wrong, you're always so right.

Well I got a mind
But I put it on vacation,
That's 'cos you're Mr. Persuasion,
Oh, how you sway me when you say it that way
Ohh, I imagine whatever you say.

They call you Mr. Persuasion
'Cos you can talk me up and down
And all you do is tell me that
(That's 'cos you're Mr. Persuasion)
All you do is tell me that
(That's 'cos you're Mr. Persuasion)
All you do is tell me that....
