It's been 10 years of investment
It's been one foot in and one out
It's been 4 days of full of shit
and I feel snuffed out

It's been 33 years of restraining
Of trying to control this tumult
How I did invest in such fantasy
But my nervous system has worn out

I feel done, I feel raked over coals
and all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up

I've repeated this dance ad-nauseum
There's still something to learn that I've not
I'm told to see this as divine perfection
But my bones don't feel this perfection

I feel done, I feel raked over coals
and all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up

I've spent life hovering above bottom
Thinking I can't survive what's below
But I've known through the kicking and screaming
That there was no other direction to go

I feel done, I feel raked over coals
and all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up
