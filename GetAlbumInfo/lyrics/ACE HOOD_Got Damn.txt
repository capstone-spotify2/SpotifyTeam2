<i>[Intro]</i>
Oh yea?

You gon pull up in that motherfuckin Ford like that there
50 grand in yo motherfuckin pocket with that bad bitch

<i>[Hook]</i>
Got damn, got damn
Why you do em like that? Got damn

How you pull up in the Porsche? 9-11 oh Lord
With a bad bitch with me and her ass so full
Got damn, got damn
Hundred thousand for the Rollie, got damn
All these diamonds in my chain, 30 bottles on the way
KOD in magic city, 50k I make it rain
Got damn!

<i>[Verse: Ace Hood]</i>
Steppin out tonight I think Iâm bout to make a movie
Drop in the Phantom, whippin bumpin Lil Boosie
Bitch I gotta checkout, just went by the whole club
Took bout 20 thousand dollars, I just call it showin love
Big money nigga, quarter millie on the juice
Ballin like a bitch, I made the ESPN news
Home boy, you can never play me for a fool
Keep a Mr. Fix It with me, thatâs who keep the tool
I say now good Lord, look at shorty, there she hall ass
Bet your money she gon fuck me for that brown bag
I said Iâm too gone off that liquor, turned up - nigga you trippin
That P Ciroc in my system, blew 10 racks as Iâm different

<i>[Hook]</i>
Got damn, got damn
Why you do em like that? Got damn

How you pull up in the Porsche? 9-11 oh Lord
With a bad bitch with me and her ass so full

KOD in magic city, 50k I make it rain
Got damn!

<i>[Verse: Plies]</i>
I was in the trap, crack or kick the doâ
I was in the room, I was beatin a ho
Crack a ice mean nigga where the snow
Told them probly in Alaska, cracker where it snow?
Dead croopers, Iâmma buy 100 Chevy
And gave em all away to all the young niggas
Got a funny feeling, Iâmma whack me a rapper
Get on TV plat crazy, like oh no what happened?
Asked me did I fuck his girlfriend, I told him I donât remember
Now did she suck me? Thatâs a strong possibility
Hit him with the 9, he got his shit down
10 racks kush and I say your chain man

<i>[Hook]</i>
Got damn, got damn
Why you do em like that? Got damn
(Wutchu mean?)
How you pull up in the Porsche? 9-11 oh Lord
With a bad bitch with me and her ass so full
Got damn, got damn
Hundred thousand for the Rollie, got damn
All these diamonds in my chain, 30 bottles on the way
KOD in magic city, 50k I make it rain
Got damn!

<i>[Verse: Ace Hood]</i>
Okay now fat black âMaro, bitches call me Bruce Wayne
Crib big itâs Wal-Mart, nigga thatâs a shame
And I keep a shooter, call that boy Dwayne Wade
Once them niggas pussy lucky, I donât call names
Catch me pullin up in that, Lord have mercy, thank You Jesus
Probly with a freak, her name Tameeka, sheâs a skeezer
Audemar bottles, til tomorrow Rose
Dope boy swag, ol Rollie and some Jâs
I be wailin on you niggas, stylin on you niggas
Go and cop a whippin, then I Instagram a picture
What yo money like? What dip dope cheddar over
My paper long, bitch etcetera, etcetera
Get it!

<i>[Hook]</i>
Got damn, got damn
Why you do em like that? Got damn

How you pull up in the Porsche? 9-11 oh Lord
