I watched you change and never knew
That you would be like all the rest
You were so true, too good to be true
I trusted you and fell apart again

I can not change the fact
That you're not coming back
So depressed I'm your slave

Betrayed me you're not the one
To be trusted with my love
Betrayed me you're not the one
Who should be trusted with my love

I had to leave so I could breath
I hate to fight that's not what I want
You were so true, too good to be true
I trusted you and fell apart again
