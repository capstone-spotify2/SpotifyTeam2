Crib worth a mill I'm the one like the Matrix
Million dollar nigga bitch I started from the basement
That's why, a nigga can't tell me shit
That's why, a nigga can't tell me shit
Feeling like a first round draft pick
Hell nah I don't owe a nigga nothing
That's why, a nigga can't tell me shit
That's why, a nigga can't tell me shit

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
You mad cause a nigga getting rich haa
Dropping them hits after hits haa

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I'm feeling myself, I'm a take me a selfie
Fuck getting rich boy I'm tryna be wealthy
Beast in the gym I'm just tryna stay healthy
Real niggas all around the world gotta feel me
Word on the street lame niggas wanna end me
They jealous, they mad they suffer from envy
Been drinking too much I hope I don't lose a kidney
Throw a couple bands it come back real quickly
Dope nigga, Ace flow like I'm in the bando
Hot boy <i>[?]</i>, clips full of ammo
Jumping out the foreign while they jumping out they faces
Tell my niggas fuck it, throw 'em back to the basics

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
How does it feel to be chosen, I am the one who was chosen
I am not laundry or clothing, it ain't no way I am folding
Put some 'Respek' on my name, they throwing salt on the game
Whipping that wraith like a slave, whipping that wraith like a slave
Got a whole lotta problems, got a whole lotta hate, shit came with the moolah
One thousand dollars on my light bill, gotta give thanks my jewlerer
I could've hit you girl already man, let a nigga start being petty
Thirty inch rims on the chevy, got a hundred round drum for your bestie
Fuck nigga freeze 'em, fuck nigga freeze 'em
A1 sauce <i>[?]</i> with the <i>[?]</i>
Touring round the world nigga screaming Hood Nation
That's a whole lotta grinding and a whole lotta patience

Man, a nigga can't tell me shit

Tell a hater something I did
Broke niggas make me sick
