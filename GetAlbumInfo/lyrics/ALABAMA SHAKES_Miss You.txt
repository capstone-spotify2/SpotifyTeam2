I'm gonna miss you
And your Mickey Mouse tattoo
And you'll be leaving in your Honda Accord

Well is it true?
All them bad things you do?
Well are they sure
Are they sure that it was you?

You could tell me
You know you could still tell me everything
Tell me - I bet you didn't do nothing wrong
Tell me - What's been going on?

Maybe the stars aligned, 
or maybe I've just changed my mind
Maybe I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
Yes, sir

Well I do not love you
Because I'm bored
No, I was just saying them things
When I was feeling a little unsure about myself 
and I'm sorry baby that wasn't right

Then you got me thinkin'
Yea, thinking of you
Thinking for the last time
Yea, the last time
Now that I know you're really gonna leave me

Maybe the stars aligned, 
or maybe I've just changed my mind
Maybe I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
Yea, yea

I'm gonna miss you
Just wait and see
I cannot chase you
I can't make you stay

Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Come on
You really didn't do nothing wrong
Baby, come on
Come on
Come on

Maybe the stars aligned, 
or maybe I've just changed my mind
Maybe I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
Yes, sir
