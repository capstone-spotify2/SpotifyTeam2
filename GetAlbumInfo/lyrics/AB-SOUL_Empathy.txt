<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
I got seven hundred dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So baby won't you fall on through
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
It's been a little while since the last time I saw you
What's up with you and ol' dude
I hope everything is all cool
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...

<i>[Alori Joh:]</i>
Can you feel, what I feel
When I feel, What I feel
Empathy... Empathy...

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
Lady if you would just give me the time
You could just leave all your problems behind
You got a past, but that's in the past
And we all know that, you can't press rewind
I understand, where are you and
I lend you a hand, if you wanted mine
Pamper you and stand for you
The man to, make everything right

<i>[Verse 3: Javonte &amp; Absoul]</i>
I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
But baby don't stress it, I hope you learned a lesson
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
I tell you I've been down that road before
If anyone can feel you then it's me
So won't you let you garments hit the floor
And let me let you feel me
Lights please, lights please
Light-skinned, mighty fiesty
Oh oh, I see, I see
You like me too

<i>[Hook: Alori Joh &amp; Ab-Soul]</i>
Can you feel, I feel, I feel
Empathy
