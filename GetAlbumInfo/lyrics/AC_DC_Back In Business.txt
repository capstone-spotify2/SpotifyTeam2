Breaking out, about to shout
Feel the need, for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wrecking ball, I'm a stinging knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life
You got screaming murder, lock up your door
Double dealing, gotta have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone
Bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favour put your soul for sale
Like a cannon ball going down the track
Need good loving, but I want it back
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preaching what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business

Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again

Back in business again, and I'm looking for you
