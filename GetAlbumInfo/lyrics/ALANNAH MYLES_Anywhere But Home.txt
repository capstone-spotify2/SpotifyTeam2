Anywhere but home
That's where you're going
It sucks to be alone
It's safer not knowing

When everything feels wrong
You don't know your left from right
When passion's running strong
And you can't see the light

B/ It's cold out there alone
As you're filling up your belly with doubt
You keep running home
Everytime we've, fallen out

You ain't goin' anywhere baby, You ain't goin' anywhere but home
You ain't goin' anywhere baby, You ain't goin' anywhere but home

With me or without me
It doesn't matter
Truth hurts like hell
There ain't nobody sadder

It's cold out there alone
You won't feel it till the bottle runs dry
Until your, blind and running home
Asking yourself, why...

You ain't goin' anywhere baby, You ain't goin' anywhere but home
You ain't goin' anywhere baby, You ain't goin' anywhere but home...
