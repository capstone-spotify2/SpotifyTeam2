Though war rages on
You'll be at my side
Through it all
Through hardships unseen
We still survive, fortified

Please don't pass me by
Can't you hear me calling out your name
Forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you
Though war rages on

When darkness comes
You're like a burning light
Through it all
When a storm knocks me down
You pull from the depths, time after time

Please don't pass me by
Can you hear me calling out your name

Please forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you

Though war rages on
I'm still here by your side
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights
Though war rages on
I'm still here by your side
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights

Please don't pass me by
Can't you hear me calling out your name
Please forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you
Though war rages on
Though war rages on
