They thought it was sweet
Thought it was good
Said all the lines they thought I should
When did I change?
What had to die,
To make me a fake who lives a lie?

Say goodbye to everything I thought I knew

Cause all that glitters isn't gold
I got lost along the way
Saw the horizons with my soul
It's the price you have to pay
It's too high a price to pay

All of my dreams
All of my words
I didn't save one penny's worth
Traded my heart for shinier things
A little twist in my arm 
And you'll know I'll sing

Say goodbye to everything I thought I knew

Cause all that glitters isn't gold
I got lost along the way
Saw the horizons with my soul
It's the price you have to pay

It's not who you are,
It's who you know
Empty your heart and the money flows
Just like glitter isn't gold
It's the price that you might pay
It's too high a price to pay

Bah, bah-bah-bah-bah,
Bah, bah-bah-bah-bah,
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah,
Bah, bah-bah-bah-bah,
Bah, bah, bah-bah-bah-bah, bah, bah,

Say goodbye to everything I thought I knew

Cause all that glitters isn't gold
I got lost along the way
Saw the horizons with my soul
It's the price you have to pay

It's not who you are,
It's who you know
Empty your heart and the money flows
Just like glitter isn't gold
It's the price that you might pay
It's too high a price

It's too high a price
