You got the last of all your stuff
You got your car cranked up
And I guess there ain't a thing that I can say
I'm thinking as I'm standing here
And suddenly it all comes clear
As I watch you drive away

They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue

I know its gonna take some time
To get you off my mind
And forget how happy we once were
I don't know how to bring you back
And as a matter of fact
The only thing I know for sure

Is that they should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue

They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue
