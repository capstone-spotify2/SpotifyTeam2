Well I been up to my neck in trouble
Up to my neck in strife
Up to my neck in misery
For most of my life
I've been a fool
And you know what a fool can do
I'm telling you
You come along when I needed you
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you

And I been up to my neck in pleasure
Up to my neck in pain
I been up to my neck on the railroad track
Waitin' for the train
To cruise on through
I figured my time was due
It's way over due
You come along and you pulled me through
Now I'm up
Up to my neck in you
Don't it feel good

I been up to my neck in whiskey
I been up to my neck in wine
I been up to my neck in wishin'
That this neck wasn't mine
I'm a loser
That ain't lost it
Baby you were to good
To good to be true
What you done no one else could do
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you
It feels good
You come along when I needed you
I'm up to my neck in you
