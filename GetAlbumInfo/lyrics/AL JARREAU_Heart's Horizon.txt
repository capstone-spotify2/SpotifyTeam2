A lullaby my little guy to hush your cryin'
A lullaby you might recall when times are tryin'
And sing every day all that you're realizing
Know every song sung in lightness and Laughter
And don't play too long in the blues that come After
Take her along
Conquer your mountains again

A lullaby my little guy the moon is rising
You'll awake to see a sight that's worth the Prizing
That new morning star high on your heart's Horizon

If you're the one that always says bygones be Bygones
And when you look you've lost the ones
That you rely on
Look deep in your heart there's something to
Keep your eyes on

Cold distant stars slowly fade while you're Sleeping
And hollow guitars will be quietly weeping
So paint the skies with your bright shining
Castles in Spain

Among the things you do each day here's one
For trying
Give it all and give again and find reply in
That new morning star
High on your heart's horizon

Look it over, so much to see
Did I say you should look at me
Not just now
When I'm lookin' around
When my guard is down
Pieces on the ground

In a twinklin' and blinkin' eye
You'll be singing a lullaby
Say just how you can turn it around
When a faith is found
Even on the ground

Lullaby, now don't you cry my Suz and Ryan
So, lullaby and tell them why
there's no
Denyin' that new mornin' star
High on your heart's horizon
There's a new morning star high on your
Heart's horizon
