I can hear a heartbeat
It seems a little strong
I can hear the things 
That I did wrong
I can hear a song
By looking in her eyes
I can hear all
The times she cried

I can hear the memory 
As they echo off the wall
Falling from the pictures 
Down the hall
I can hear regret
Building up inside of me
I can hear all them things 
I could not see

Those are the sounds of a woman leavin'
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
Those are the sounds of a heart breakin'
You can't hear it but the noise is killin' me

I should have heard it comin'
But I chose to pretend
I should have recognized 
That sound way back then
But I just wouldn't listen
And didn't want to all those years
Now the truth is is ringin' clear
In my ears

Those are the sounds of a woman leavin'
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
Those are the sounds of a heart breakin'
You can't hear it but the noise is killin' me

Those are the sounds of a heart breakin'
You can't hear it but the noise is killin' me

I can hear it
And the silence is killin' me...
