Iâm a sinner with a broken heart 
Itâs not easy but we made it (in)to an art. 
Joy until the morning do us apart 
Without love, without names 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
One day, one day of my time 
Thatâs what it takes for you to love me 
One day, one day of my time 
And again and again that melody 
Youâre never gonna reach that part of me, oh 
One day, one day of my time.

All forgotten with the break of dawn 
But our story lingers on 
Iâm leaving with my passion full withdrawn 
With your essence already gone

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Maybe cos Iâm a gambler. 
Tired of this Bodegas 
Some say Iâm a rambler 
Searching for my Vegas (searching for my Vegas) 
One day is all I need (is all I need..) 

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
