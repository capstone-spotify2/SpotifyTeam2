Four long years ago, searching for the snow
We found the Tahoe lakes, just about the perfect place
50 Runs at 'Heavenly', and the nights at 'Squaw Valley'
Yeah, the trees are pretty wide, "That's where Sonny bono died"

All is quiet on New Years day, think I'll try and impress my mates
So I jump into the lake, I won't do that again, here we go again....

The south shore has the lot, and last month Dave Lee Roth did a solo spot
And some German bloke got shot, every year we say the same
"Try somewhere different for a change", but we jump on to the plane
Yeah, here we go again
