Rap up!
Rap it up!

Put some wax on the trax and slide on outta here
Hane hane hane hane hane

Hatchets in the corner ears to the ground
Improve to the groove get down to the sound
Buttons and bows and bleu blanc rouge
All things lively must be used
LibertÃ©, egalitÃ©, au jourd'hui c'est trÃ¨s trÃ¨s trÃ¨s
Voici l'opportunitÃ© nous incroyables

I got the moves they got the grooves
Summoned the Gods and they all approved
Bad vibes akimbo on the shelf
Bit of a rap thing going for myself
This gold on the teeth's no sense at all
It only matters when it's on the wall

I'm standing here with my four men
Let's start that rapping thing again:

Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours truly
In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth
In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth
I have the mouth

So tired of anarchists looking at me
Don't need their credibility
"Destroy," they say, "Defy! Condemn!"
As long as you don't destroy them
With twenty years of drugs and drink
I thought the time had come to think
About standing up and saying that
It's tragedy and such old hat

I'm standing here with my four men
Let's start that rapping thing again:

(I got) Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours truly
In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth
In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth
I have the mouth

These happy feet are all we need
Summoned the Gods and they all agreed
These feet won't stop they're in such a hurry
I knock it on the head and I go for a curry
Staying sober can be neat
Get drunk on these here happy feet
Keep on trying to pin me down
"Why a title for your sound?"
I'm standing here with my four men
Let's do this rapping thing again...

I got Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours truly
In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth...

In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing I have the mouth... <i>[repeat]</i>

In the naughty North and in the sexy South
We're all singing
And I have the mouth
And you have the mouth
And they got the mouth
