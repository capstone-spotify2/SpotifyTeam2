Oh, the violence...

The ocean beckons with it's gaze
Pulling me beneath the waves
Their fury is second to none!

Oh the violence...

It's clawing at my burning skin
Filling my heart with it's sin,
Human reason is washed away!
Am I the first to be fooled by
Your dirty little trick?
I guess I should have seen this coming,
I will not forget
I will not forget
(Is washed away)

I'm the one who has to swallow water,
That's what I get for chasing after you!
You should be hanging by your neck,
Swinging there silently!

I can't stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me...
Tell me that you love me if you want me...
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Telling me you want me, do you want me?
Telling me you want me, do you love me?

It is quite clear you despise me
By showing your face here
And you never even told me
Why you disappeared!
Why you disappeared!
(Is washed away)

I'm the one who has to swallow water,
That's what I get for chasing after you!
You should be hanging by your neck,
Swinging there silently!

I can't stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me...
Tell me that you love me if you want me...
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Telling me you want me, do you want me?
Telling me you want me, do you love me?

A bone chilling cry erupts!
A bone chilling cry erupts!

(I've seen those eyes but not that smile)
A bone chilling cry erupts!
(I've seen those eyes but not that blank stare)
A bone chilling cry erupts!
(I've seen those eyes but not that blank stare)
A bone chilling cry erupts!
(I've seen those eyes but not that stare)
The tides of sin are stained with blood!

I can't stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me...
Tell me that you love me if you want me...
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Telling me you want me, do you want me?
Telling me you want me, do you love me?

You will be sorry when
He spills the blood from your throat!
You'll be torn limb from limb, tramp!

There will be hell to pay, hell to pay!
