I hold you
I hold you closer then I ever knew
I could do
But I'm confused
I thought I'd recognize when love was true
But I'm confused

Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference
Do you have instructions
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney

You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I think I'm still turning out

In my mind
I thought the birds would sing and sparks would fly
But it's just quiet
Am I cruel?
Or am I ignorant or was I fooled
By the stories I knew

Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference
Do you have instructions
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney

You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I hope you stick around
We're gonna figure it out
Who can I turn to now?
When I'm still turning out
When I'm still turning out

I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?

Cuz I'm still turning out
