Rest your head on the Earth
For to me, you are worth
More than life can give
And I will love no other

For as long as I live
And beyond, I'll be with you
Can you trust in me?
Can I be your lover?

If the sun could not burn
If the world should not turn
I would still have you	
Always to discover
Can you trust in me?
Can I be your lover?

Rest your head on the earth
For to me, you are worth
More than life can give
And I will love no other

Can I be, can I be
Will you lie next to me?
Will you be my love?
Can I be your lover?
Will you take my hand?
Can I be your lover?

Rest your head on the earth
For to me, you are worth
More than life can give
And I will love no other
Can you trust in me?
Can I be your lover?

Gone is the reason and why
Ever more, lost am I
Till someday, but who knows where or when

If the sun could not burn
If the world should not turn
I would still have you
Always to discover
Can you trust in me?
Can I be your lover?

Just a word, just a day
Can I be, can I be
Will you lie next to me?
Will you take my hand?
Can I be your lover?
Will you trust in me?
Can I be your lover?
Can I be, can I be
Will you lie next to me?
Will you be my love?
Can I be your lover?
Will you take my hand?
Can I be your lover?
