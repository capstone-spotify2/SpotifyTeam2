It's the kids, baby

It's the kids, baby
And ya know we're gonna groove
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby

Leave it up, leave it up to me

Listen to the kids
Grown up, sewn up
Even when they mess up
Actin' like it's all sewn up
Mom and dad think we
Need to have a talk
Think the kids rule the world
Boys and girls

You can't blame us for notta
You taught us, to follow orders
Cuz I'm the baby, dun gotta
Monkey see (ah ah)
Monkey do no more
The fun stops here
What's the score
We might start a play fight
Just to imitate you
Donchya feel silly now
Shame on you
Don't start to cry now
I don't blame you
Afterall your just a grown-up
Whachya gonna do

It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

It's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

When the grown-ups go awol
Who ya gonna call
Here come the young ones
The baby crime busters
Big people, listen up
Relax now we're equal
And if the money's right
Then we might make a sequal
Do I hear a "please"?
I love it when you beg me
I need a bribe now
Just to move my legs, see
And I might fit you in
If you make way

(Lemme talk to my people we can save the day)

It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up

Speed it up, speed it up
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up

(Now whatchya gonna do)

Mom and dad, they be
Gettin' on my nerves
Workin' em, workin' em
Is that what I deserve
But after many days
Hey, I want them back
Tell me who's gonna bake
My cake and all that
Who's gonna suffer from
My practical jokes
And answer when I'm moving
Hey, it's gotta be my folks
And who's gonna get me up
Ready for the flight
And who's gonna tell me
"Everything's alright"

But wait a minute
That sounds so soft
That won't impress a
Hot chicka that I cross
Don't play me out cuz
I'll switch ya off
You've been told old for too long
Singin' the same song
If you're old enough to vote
Then it's time to sit down
It's all about the little hommies
Takin' the crown
So if you're too young to vote
Here's your chance to have a say
Come on everybody
Help me save the day

It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

It's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up
How's that
