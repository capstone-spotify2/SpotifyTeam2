Got no place to run 
Got no place to hide 
Sittin' at the railway station 
Destination far behind, behind 

Lived my life for love 
Love that's hard to find 
Some are givers, I'm a taker 
Love can make you blind 
Make you blind 

Got no time to lose 
Time you just can't find 
Give a dozen yesterday's 
To make tomorrow mine 
Make it mine 

Got one life to live 
That's just borrowed time 
Don't close or blink your eyes 
You lose your chance to fly 
Chance to fly 

Got no place to run 
Got no place to hide 
Sittin' at the railway station 
Destination far behind, behind 

Lived my life for love 
Love that's hard to find 
Some are givers, I'm a taker 
Love can make you blind 
Make you blind
