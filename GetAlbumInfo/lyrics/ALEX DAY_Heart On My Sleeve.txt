Looks like Iâve fallen in love again
Kiss me, save me, be my closest friend
Weâve waited all year to have tonight
Donât hold back and I will make you mine
I will make you mine
I will make you mine

It started with a kiss and ended with Iâll miss you, yes I do
So tell me what you want and I will wear that mask for you
We say weâre being truthful but I canât get near you when I do
I just canât shake the image of my hands exploring you

Lie down, let me in
I will give you everything
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Touch me and I wonât let you go
Make me what you need
You know what you want with me
I wear my heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve

I will make you mine
I will make you mine

For now youâre far away but close enough to miss you, and I do
For all the girls in all the world, Iâve got my eye on you
Iâm ready for the day when I will get over you, I will do
But first just let me give myself entirely to you

Lie down, let me in
I will give you everything
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Touch me and I wonât let you go
Make me what you need
You know what you want with me
I wear my heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve

And Iâm not gonna lose you
I will fly around the world
If I have to show you
What you mean to me

And Iâm not gonna lose you
I will fly around the world
If I have to show you
What you mean to me

Looks like Iâve fallen in love again

Lie down, let me in
I will give you everything
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Touch me and I wonât let you go
Make me what you need
You know what you want with me
I wear my heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve

Lie down, let me in
I will give you everything
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Touch me and I wonât let you go
Make me what you need
You know what you want with me
I wear my heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve

I will make you mine
