When in Rome do as the French do in Spain
Lemme, fall down in German, get me back up again
Fly me hell bent for leather, up to the moon
You better, wipe that indecision off your face
Come with me you can do it
Don't be the fool who blew it
You gotta get into it, uh huh

Comment Ca Va baby, how are you doin' darling
Comment Ca Va Cheri, Ciao Bella, Bellissimo

Come be my diamond, sparkle, my senses silly
Lemme, whisper sweet something in you ear
I think you're ready for a, lobotomy
You got me screaming love... all over the place
Shower me with your kisses
Make me your only missus
Respect me, love me like yo ho

Comment Ca Va baby, how are you doin' darling
Comment Ca Va Cheri, Comon' and quit your foolin'
Comon' an' kiss me honey, you're SO right it's not funny
Comment Ca Va, Ca Va, Ca Va bien

In the back seat of your car...
