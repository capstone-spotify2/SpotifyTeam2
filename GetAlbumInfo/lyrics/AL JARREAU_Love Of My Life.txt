Hey baby where you been
Don't try to stare me down with lying eyes
My baby don't you know that I'm the one
Who's been right by your side

How many times I have to tell you
That no one could love you more
Can I believe it's me you're pimpin for
Boy you know how much I love you
Don't you know how much I care
I need to know it's me you're living for

Do do do do do do do do do
You're the love of my life
Love of my life, yes you are

Hey baby where'd you go
I can't help it girl
I'm I'm jealous of you so
Now baby, don't you know
I ain't gonna let you
Walk out through the door

How many times I have to tell you
That no one could love you more
Can I believe that he is just a friend
Boy you know how much I love you
Don't you know how much I care
Well then do me, do me, do me to the end

Do do do do do do do do do
You're the love of my life
Love of my life, yes you are

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
You're the love of my life
Love of my life
Baby don't you ever go

Do do do do do do do do do
You're the love of my life
Love of my life, yes you are

Well let's break up the conversation
For some sultry romance
Baby feel the sweet sensation
C'mon do the dance

Ain't nothin' I can do 'bout it

Do do do do do do do do do
You're the love of my life
Love of my life, yes you are
