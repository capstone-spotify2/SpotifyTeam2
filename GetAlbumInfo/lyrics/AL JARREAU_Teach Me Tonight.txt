Did you say, "I've got a lot to learn?"
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn.
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight.

Starting with, the "A,B,C" of it
Right down to the "X,Y,Z" of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight.

The sky's a blackboard
high above you,
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight

If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight.

I've lost all fear my love,
Teach me tonight.
