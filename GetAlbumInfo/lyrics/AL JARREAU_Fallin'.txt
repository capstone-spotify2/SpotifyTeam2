Misty water colors
Raining trees and flowers
All inside a picture frame
Silent galleria
Quiet nostalgia
Sweet images remain
Just a face and a memory
Can't forget you were so near to me

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I'm always...fallin'...lovin'...leavin'
Always...fallin'...lovin'...leave and
Then begin again

Another night in Paris
Misty eyes and hair
Fashioned by the wind and rain
Another night to cherish
Pressed inside a heart
Where the images remain
Painted spaces and memories
Quiet places remind me
You're still by me

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
