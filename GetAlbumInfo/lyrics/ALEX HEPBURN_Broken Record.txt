Broken records on the floor
I just can't seem to find the strength no more
I crawl between the piano keys
Searching for a melody
I can't seem to find a cure
You're all that I hear

I hold on when no one seems to care for me
Hold on when the world has turned its back on me
I hold on when there's nothing left to say or do
I hold on to you

If I could stop the pain inside
Just to let me rest my eyes
When I'm begging for release my heart whispers softly
Let him go in peace

I hold on when no one seems to care for me
Hold on when the world has turned its back on me
I hold on when there's nothing left to say or do
I hold on to you

So talk to me
Or am I the fool
You talk to me
Can we make it through
Just talk to me
Take away my pain
Cause I don't understand
This broken game

I hold on when no one seems to care for me
Hold on when the world has turned its back on me
I hold on when there's nothing left to say or do
I hold on to you
