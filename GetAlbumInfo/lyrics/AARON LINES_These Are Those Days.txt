Thereâs a calendar hanging in the kitchen,
Today Iâm taking it down Iâm tired of living
Like tomorrow canât get here fast enough.
Took a while but Iâm finally learning
To make the most of each moment Iâm given
Instead of waiting on better days to come.
No more wishing my life away.

These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I wonât look ahead,
I wonât look back.
Iâm gonna live,
Iâm gonna laugh.
Well I wonât let another second waste,
These are those days.

Itâs been awhile since Iâve called up my mother
Just for the sake of saying I love her,
Ainât gonna wait around till itâs too late.
Iâve always wanted to see the Grand Canyon.
Its time I stopped talking and just start planning.
No more excuses no more saying someday, someday.
No more dreaming my life away.


These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I wonât look ahead,
I wonât look back.
Iâm gonna live,
Iâm gonna laugh.
Well I wonât let another second waste,
These are those days.

These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I wonât look ahead,
I wonât look back.
Iâm gonna live,
Iâm gonna laugh.
Well I wonât let another second waste,
No, I wonât let another second waste.
These are those days.

(This is my life, the time is now to get things right.)
These are those days.
(I wonât look back, Iâm gonna live Iâm gonna laugh.)
Donât wanna waste my life away,
These are those days.
