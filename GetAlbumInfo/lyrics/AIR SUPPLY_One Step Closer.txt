I didn't really walk away I had something to explain
Trying to reach you night and day when I did not know your name
Shall we promise just to talk and be alone, all alone

Why can't the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight
Whisper the words I need to know speak to me that way tonight
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you
Come to me today
Chorus
One step closer forward motion
One step near our destination

How can I bring myself to sleep till I'm resting by your side
Sharing the secrets hard to keep when you live them all through the night
And then wake up with the words I'll always want you to say
Come to me today

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
A lonely man has come undone
Is it wrong to think I understand where you are as close to me
Not much further to go

Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you
Come to me today

<i>[Chorus]</i>
