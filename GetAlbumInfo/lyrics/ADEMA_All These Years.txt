One got addicted
And the other ran away
Some settled down a familiar place
One let's go of the wheel
While the other one steers
One got the money that the other put away
Some held their ground and the others couldn't stay
A few just followed their dreams while the others stood clear

After all these years
After all these years

One found religion and the other lost faith
One sold something that he never could replace
Both looked back to see if the coast was clear
One hits the bottle till his problems go away
The other never made it home from school that day
Sometimes I wish I could just disappear

After all these years
After all these years

It feels like some days that the sun never shines
I can't decipher all these riddles and rhymes
They're going down in flames
They're burning alive
I just can't take this anymore
One looked back at the past and I'm finally here
After all these years

One got addicted
And the other ran away
Some held around while the others couldn't stay
One let's go of the wheel
While the other one steers
After all these years
One found religion and the other lost faith
One sold something that he never could replace
After all these years
Both looked back to see if the coast was clear
