So today I wrote a song for you 
Cause a day can get so long 
And I know it's hard to make it through 
When you say there's something wrong 

So I'm trying to put it right 
Cause I want to love you with my heart 
All this trying has made me tired 
And I don't know even where to start 

Maybe that's a start 

For you know it's a simple game 
That you play filling up your head with rain 
And you know you've been hiding from your pain 
In the way, in the way you say your name 

And I see you 
Hiding your face in your hands 
Flying so you won't land 
You think no one understands 
No one understands 

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head 
And your throat is aching but you swear 
No one hurts you, nothing could be sad 
Anyway you're not here enough to care 

And you're so tired you don't sleep at night 
As your heart is trying to mend 
You keep it quiet but you think you might 
Disappear before the end 

And it's strange how you cannot find 
Any strength to even try 
To find a voice to speak your mind 
When you do, all you wanna do is cry 

Well maybe you should cry 

And I see you hiding your face in your hands 
Talking 'bout far-away lands 
You think no one understands 
Listen to my hands 

And all of this life 
Moves around you 
For all that you claim 
You're standing still 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
I will move with you
