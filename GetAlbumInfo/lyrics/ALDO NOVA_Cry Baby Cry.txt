You think that love is just a fool's game
I'm not so sure you may be right
But every game has got its rules, baby
By which we judge the wrongs and rights
Oh, yeah

I think it's time
For us to draw the line
'Cause what gave you the right
To make me cry?

Oh, lie, don't lie to me, baby
I told you before, I'm drawing the line
So cry, but don't cry to me, baby
I told you before, you're wasting your time

So now you look at me with sad eyes
And hoping that I'll hesitate, oh no
But now I've heard enough of your lies
I'm telling you, you're a bit too late
Oh yeah

I think it's time
For us to draw the line
'Cause what gave you the right
To make me cry?

Oh, lie, don't lie to me, baby
I told you before, I'm drawing the line
So cry, but don't cry to me, baby
'Cause I told you before, you're wasting your time

Don't cry to me, baby, no more
Don't you cry to me, baby, no more
You think that I'm crazy
Cry to me, baby, no more
No more
No more

Oh, lie, don't lie to me, baby
I told you before, I'm drawing the line
So cry, but don't cry to me, baby
'Cause I told you before, you're wasting your time

Don't cry to me, baby
Cry to me, baby, no more
Don't cry to me, baby
Think that I'm crazy
But no more
No more
No more
