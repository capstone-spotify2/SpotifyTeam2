My best friend called me, He said I'm going to a party, He asked me If I wanna come along, well I'm on

Put on my worn out blue jeans, they gotta hole in the left knee, but they've never ever done wrong, so long

I'm hoping when I get there that I'll meet the one who'd make the Earth start shaking and pound it like a drum

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Giddy up Get ready let's get it on
And we'll be one step, two step, three step dancing, then we'll party all night long, and we'll be going strong (hoo hoo hoo) we'll set the night on fire until the break of dawn,
Giddy up get ready let's get it on

From the moment that I saw her, my eyes kept looking over, to me she looked just like a cherry pie. my my.
She said welcome to the party, I said girl you talking to me, could it be its my lucky night, thats right.
Then with just one kiss I knew that she would be the one who'd make the Earth start shaking and pound it like a drum.

Giddy up get ready lets get it on
And we'll be one step, two step, three step dancing, then we'll party all night long, and we'll be going strong (hoo hoo hoo) we'll set the night on fire until the break of dawn,
Giddy up get ready lets get it on

Then with one kiss I knew that she would be the one who'd make the Earth start shaking and pound it like a drum

Giddy (staggered) up get ready lets get it on

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Giddy up get ready lets get it on
And we'll be one step, two step, three step dancing, then we'll party all night long, and we'll be going strong (hoo hoo hoo) we'll set the night on fire until the break of dawn,
Giddy up get ready lets get it on
