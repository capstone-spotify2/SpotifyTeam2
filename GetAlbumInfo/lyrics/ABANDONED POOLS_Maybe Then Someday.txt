What's this thing that's haunting me
Won't my mind just let me be
With you I have to be so sober

Have our plans washed out to sea
Did we drown too easily
It's not sinking in that its over

Maybe then someday
Maybe then someday
Maybe then someday
Maybe then
Maybe then we'll make it right

If I rip you from my chest
Live my life like a scientist
Only logic will destroy me

I will pull apart my bones
To build a fire to keep you warm
And if that's not enough then its ok

Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
We got a lot to loose
Maybe then someday
Maybe then
Maybe then we'll make it right

Well maybe 
Such a desperate word to say
And maybe 
Gets me through another day
And maybe something's got a hold on you
Just maybe
Is becoming maybe not
Yeah.

Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
We got a lot to lose
Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
Maybe then 
Maybe then we'll make it right
After all this time.
