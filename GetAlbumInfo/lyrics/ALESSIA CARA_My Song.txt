Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between time
The meantime that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
"Don't deviate, " they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
So I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious desire

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
Cause my song will live on beyond time

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
