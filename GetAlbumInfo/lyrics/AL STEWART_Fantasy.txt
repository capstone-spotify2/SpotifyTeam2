I prefer fantasy to reality, that's what you said to me
Whenever we'd talk watching the world go by
You don't act in defy with any thing they try to make you say or do.

Here in a warm cocoon, under a dreamy moon
You can be lost as soon as you want to be
And in this ever-changing world of wonder, nothing bothers me
Living here in this fantasy.

Under a dreamy moon, in this warm cocoon
You can be lost as soon as you want to be
And in this ever-changing world of wonder, nothing bothers me
Living this fantasy.
