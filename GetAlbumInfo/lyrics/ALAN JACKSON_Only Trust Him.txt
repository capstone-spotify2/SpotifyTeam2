Come, every soul by sin oppressed; 
Thereâs mercy with the Lord, 
And He will surely give you rest 
By trusting in His Word. 

Only trust Him, only trust Him, 
Only trust Him now; 
He will save you, He will save you, 
He will save you now. 

For Jesus shed His precious blood 
Rich blessings to bestow; 
Plunge now into the crimson flood 
That washes white as snow. 

Only trust Him, only trust Him, 
Only trust Him now; 
He will save you, He will save you, 
He will save you now. 

Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way, 
That leads you into rest; 
Believe in Him without delay 
And you are fully blessed. 

Only trust Him, only trust Him, 
Only trust Him now; 
He will save you, He will save you, 
He will save you now. 

Only trust Him, only trust Him, 
Only trust Him now; 
He will save you, He will save you, 
He will save you now.
