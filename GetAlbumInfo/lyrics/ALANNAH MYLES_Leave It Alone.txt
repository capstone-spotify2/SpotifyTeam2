Some are confused between love and sex
For there is a difference... oh yeah
Sex satisfies lust, lust won't change you
It just lies there... yeah, yeah

You can pay someone for sex
You can't pay no one to love you
If true love can be bought...
I could never be rich enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Ah... Leave it alone
Don't bet that I'm ready to sell my soul
Ah... leave it alone...
Don't mean that I'm willing to make it alone
Am I missing the point
Ah... leave it alone

Some love to lie, don't care with who
I think I'm indifferent... what about you...
Two halves are whole, no one is in control
Or more the wiser... yeah, yeah

Sex without love is lust
That's where we get confused
In love you give yourself...
Lust is just, someone gettin' used...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Ah... Leave it alone...
Don't bet that I'm ready to sell my soul
Ah... Leave it alone...
Don't mean that I'm willing to make it alone
Am I missing the point
Ah... Leave it alone...

<i>[Breakdown]</i>

<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
