Don't wait for your love
To come from tomorrow
Don't wait for your love
To come from yesterday
Your heart better skip a
Beat tomorrow
Your heart better jump
A beat from yesterday
Don't wait for the
Love you lost
When someone needs
The love that you have
Don't ache for the
Love you need
Someone somewhere
Wants what you've got

Maybe she's looking
For you in London
L is for lover
Maybe she's looking
For you in Boston
O is for an offer
Maybe she's looking
For you in Houston
V you got to venture
Maybe she's looking
For you in Kingston
E maybe forever

Don't wait for your mum
To lesson your sorrow
Don't wait for the crown
To bring you brighter days
Your heart better skip
A beat to tomorrow
Your heart better jump
A beat from yesterday
Don't wait for the love you lost
When someone needs
The love that you have
Don't ache for the love you need
Someone somewhere
Wants what you've got
Don't cry for the love you lost
When someone needs
The love that you have
Don't sigh for the love you need
Someone somewhere
Wants what you've got

Do not cry for the love you lost
Do not cry for the love you need
Do not mourn for the love you lost
Don't mourn for the love you need
Do not cry for the love you lost
Do not ache for the love you need
Do not mourn for the love you lost
Don't mourn for the love you need

Maybe she's looking for you in Moscow
L is for lover
Looking for you in Glasgow
O is for an offer
Maybe she's looking for you in Rio
V you got to venture
Maybe she's looking for you in Tokyo
E maybe forever
Maybe she's looking for you in Sydney
L is for lover
Maybe she's looking for you in Philly
O is for an offer
Maybe she's looking for you in Lisbon
V you got to venture
Maybe she's looking for you in Brooklyn
E maybe forever
