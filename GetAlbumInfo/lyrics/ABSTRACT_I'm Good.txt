Youâre no hero
So donât act like it
And please donât treat me
Like iâm yo sidekick
Cause I watch T.V
I see how life is
And itâs not easy
But still Iâm right here
Screaminâ
Iâm good,Iâm good,Iâm good,Iâm good
Yeah
My nigga
Iâm good,Iâm good,Iâm good,Iâm good

Coming up to me
Like âyou still making music,man?â
Ask them kind questions
Shouldnât even shake your hand
Though you were the homie
Still donât know me
Itâs so ever damn
2 Million fucking views
And growing
Follow my accomplishments
I mean
Cause I do work my ass off
Back up in the game
Like my vocals got the cast off
All Iâve been is cast off
By those who seem to lack heart
Tryna give the world some hope
So through the dark
Iâll cast art
Hoping lifeâs the way
Brightens your yesterday
Lifeâs been dark
And yâall can see Iâve had a lot to say
Few friends have been supportive
You can tell by how I word it
So being round that energy
I feel I can afford it
Talking bout I need direction
Samba where is yours
Iâve had mine
And itâs the only thing
That Iâve been working toward
And I built it from the floor
Yâall donât seem to help no more
See itâs hard to movement
Cause the internetâs what opened door

What I mean to say
Is yâall ainât been about the dream
Even back in highschool
Yâall werenât really bout the team
To those who were
You know I know
And your support means everything
Bout to prove
Come from anywhere
And become anything
That you can take whatever you love
And make it everything
What part is bigger than us
We made it everything
And you know
Itâs because I wear my word
Like a wedding ring
Sticking to my cray
Put honesty above everything
Cause,I ainât been perfect
But at least I got a purpose
Rising stars in my contact list
We hit beats and we merk shit
Conversation with the greatest
Canât wait to say I made it
Shouts to those who say
I helped them get through hard times
You my favourite
Shouts to channels that upload me
And the haters that can blow me
And shouts out to a world
Insists of you won't seek control me
Blogs that show me love
And friends who love what we does
Everyone who sees us hitting the before it comes
