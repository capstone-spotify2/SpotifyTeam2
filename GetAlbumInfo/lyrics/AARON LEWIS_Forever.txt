Another cheap high rise hotel room
Another place another show
Another meaningless...
Destination with nowhere to go

Another Time to say "I love you"
Another Time to say "Good night"
Another Time to hear a dial tone
'Cause no one wants to fight
Why should we fight?

'Cause I can see it in your eyes...
Is the sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!

And I can feel it when we touch...
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!

Another time to miss a birthday
Another time to miss my flight
I've missed so much, that I don't know what I have
And what I thought I might.
What I might 'cause

I can see it in your eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!

And I can feel it when we touch
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!

Now I'm lying beside you...
A stranger in your arms
We drift apart together
And come back like a storm...
Like a storm...

Another show up in Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this Equator
Takes me far away from home
I'm coming home 'cause

I can see it in your eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever

And I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
'Cause this is forever

I can see it in your eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever

I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
This is forever
