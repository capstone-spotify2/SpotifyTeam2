It's been a minute
Everything's the same but different
Everyone moved on or stayed too long
Doing the same things

Can't help but miss it
Thought I might come back and visit you
And I moved on but we've still got
A whole lot of history

Is it too late?
I know we went separate ways
But I just wanted to say
Hey

Yo, I'm back home for the weekend
Called you up but you were sleeping
I wanna do those things we used to do
Back when we ran these neighbourhood streets
Wrote our names in the wet cement
We can't go back again
But we can pretend for one more weekend
One more weekend

We said forever
Never thought our time together'd ever stop
But it did and we're not kids anymore

I've got our photos in a drawer
People don't keep those anymore
But I did, can't get rid of who we were before

Is it too late?
I know we went separate ways
But I just wanted to say
Hey

Yo, I'm back home for the weekend
Called you up but you were sleeping
I wanna do those things we used to do
Back when we ran these neighbourhood streets
Wrote our names in the wet cement
We can't go back again
But we can pretend for one more weekend
One more weekend

Monday will wash away the fantasies
We'll have to go back and face reality
But we've got forever between now and then
We can pretend

Yo, I'm back home for the weekend
Called you up but you were sleeping
I wanna do those things we used to do
Back when we ran these neighbourhood streets
Wrote our names in the wet cement
We can't go back again
But we can pretend for one more weekend
One more weekend
We can pretend for one more weekend
One more weekend
One more weekend
One more weekend, yeah
