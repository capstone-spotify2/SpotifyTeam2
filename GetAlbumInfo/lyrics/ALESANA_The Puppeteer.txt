I welcome you to paradise!
Itâs what you wished for
A mountain of filth haunted by tortured shrieks of the dead!
I know youâll love it here!

Time stops and once again Iâm stranded nowhere
And yet again Iâm so confused
Why stop?
It honestly canât get much worse and Iâm better off here than on my own

Step right up, come one and all!
I will be your host tonight!
Welcome to the dreams of hell!
Youâre in for a wild ride!

Itâs strange but I feel right at home
Itâs odd but I donât want to go
Am I a fool? Am I crazy to want to stay? Do I belong?
Another time, another place? This will do just fine

Foolish mortal, what did you think?
That youâd shackle the hands of time?
And defeat the Gods themselves?
Sweet vanity youâre my favorite sin!
Swallow mountains and choke on them
Then drown yourself on Lazarus
Spread your wings and grab the sun
Sweet vanity youâre my favorite sin!

Pretty lady letâs dance!
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave?
Everybody is dead!
Youâre all alone and Iâm the one, the only one! Yea!

Iâll do whatever it takes
Oh, whatâs another mistake

Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep
Weâre trying to escape
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me...

Feeling the pressure, I should be over you
Slave to the pleasure, I canât get over you
Tonight weâll try to pretend that weâre alright, yea
Say its forever, donât let me fade away

Everythingâs gone, everythingâs lost
What have I done? Can it be undone?
Where did you go? Will I find you?
This is our home, sweet home. The canvas went up in flames

Pretty lady letâs dance!
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave?
Everybody is dead!
Youâre all alone and Iâm the one, the only one! Yea!

Iâll do whatever it takes
Oh, whatâs another mistake

Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep
Weâre trying to escape
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me...

Feeling the pressure, I should be over you
Slave to the pleasure, I canât get over you
Tonight weâll try to pretend that weâre alright, yea
Say its forever, donât let me fade away
Iâm everything you want, Iâm everything you need
Youâre everything to me, donât let me fade away

Foolish mortal, what did you think?
That youâd shackle the hands of time?
And defeat the Gods themselves?
Sweet vanity youâre my favorite sin!
Swallow mountains and choke on them
Then drown yourself on Lazarus
Spread your wings and grab the sun
Sweet vanity youâre my favorite sin!

Parting is such sweet sorrow
Come back to me soon my dear
I will be counting the days
Farewell my love
This is our home, sweet home
Drench yourself in the cries of the damned!
Spill their blood!
Bathe in bliss as we torture the sane!
Help me, God!
