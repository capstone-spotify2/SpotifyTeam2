(Uh ho, ooh, oh no)
I see everybody around
But it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad
'Cause you just can't seem to hide it

Them lights are movin' to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it
I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby
I'm feeling alright, you got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long

So tell the DJ play it, tonight the admission is free
Now we're shutting the club down
We're moving out to the streets
All we got left is love now

Feel my troubles pounding to the rhythm of your heartbeat
When we're together, everything just comes together baby
Every motion calls your name, every excuse on me
And I hope you're ready

'Cause as long as I see the strobe lights I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby
I'm feeling alright you got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long

So tell the DJ play it, forget all my worries now
Need to put the past behind
Unless this worlds in a hurry no
We stand still in time

Them lights are movin' to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it
And I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby
I'm feeling alright, you got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long
It all night long, it all night long, it all night long
It all night long, it all night long
Oh yeah! All Night Long.

It's only you and me together and this feeling's so strong
Wish I could stay like this forever, all night long

All Night Long
All Night Long
All Night Long
All Night Long
