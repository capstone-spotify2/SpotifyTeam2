I keep trying 
Ainât no denying
We should be together now
I canât imagine
Youâre with another man
Baby, it can be wrong

To play with, in this love
After all of this time
(All of this time)

You canât hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, youâll see
I canât walk away if you want to stay
You canât hide your love
(Hide your love)
(You gotta hide your love)

I can remember
Last time you needed me
Iâm always here left to know
And when it all goes wrong 
And things are not the same
Iâm always your price to pay	

But I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)

You canât hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, youâll see
I canât walk away if you want to stay
You canât hide your love
(Hide your love)
(Hide your love, oh my)

Can we, in this love
Yes I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
All of this time

You canât hide your love from me
(From me, deep insideâ¦)
Deep inside your heart, youâll see
I canât walk away if you want to stay
(Walk away, if you wanna stay)
You canât hide your love
