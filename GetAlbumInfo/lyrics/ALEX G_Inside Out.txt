Do you remember that night
Your favorite record was on
You held my hand for a while
And then you looked in my eyes
Just like an Ed Sheeran song
You gave me love and a smile
But that was then and this is now and it feels like we're on the edge
And everyday it's getting harder to pretend
This back and forth and yes and no has gotta end
It's gotta end

Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out and upside down
Ooooh
Even if there's no way out I can't stop now
This is not the way that it's meant to be
I can't let you go and it's killing me
Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out inside out

Last night we counted the stars
We traded stories of scars
I feel asleep in your arms
And I woke up to a kiss
Wish it was always like this
Instead of all these what ifs

And I'm not okay
I feel like your mind changes almost everyday
I hang on every moment everything you say
So tell me if I'm not enough for you to stay
So can you stay

Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out and upside down
Ooooh
Even if there's no way out I can't stop now
This is not the way that it's meant to be
I can't let you go and it's killing me
Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out inside out

And I'm not okay
I feel like your mind changes almost everyday
I hang on every moment everything you say
So tell me if I'm not enough for you to stay
So can you stay

Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out and upside down
Ooooh
Even if there's no way out I can't stop now
This is not the way that it's meant to be
I can't let you go and it's killing me
Ooooh
You're turning me all inside out inside out
