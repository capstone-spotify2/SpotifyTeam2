Watching us over the other side.
Keeping you from being too close, not too tight.
I gotta know I can escape if it goes that way.
I need a get out, I'm looking for a get out.

When it all goes so right, I expect it to go wrong.
If there's a cloud out there somewhere, I'll be under it before too long.

But, I never wanted anyone more than you.
I'm so blue like an angel's tears.
I fall in two.
I could find my way in the desert.
It's what I do when I need a way out.
I'm looking for a get out.

Never known why I get so scared.
Too much emotion makes me too aware.
I have to know I can be safe alone.
I always need a way out.
I'm looking for a get out.

But you feel so right and it feels so good.
I don't think I'd find anybody, but if I could.

'Cause I never wanted anyone more than you.
I'm so blue like an angel's tears.
I fall in two.
I could find my way in the desert.
It's what I do when I need a way out
