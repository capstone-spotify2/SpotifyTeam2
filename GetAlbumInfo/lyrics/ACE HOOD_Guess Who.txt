Feds steady knockin' at my door again
Who is that
Relax, relax, relax, relax

Guess who came with that bag
Guess who came in that Jag
Guess who came to the club, just to fuck it up, make a hater mad
Guess who came in that Benz, but he leavin' in the Wraith
Guess who kept it one k, guess who never lost faith
If there's a will, there's a way
Count a mill, say good grace
I can see it in your face, I can tell you're a snake
Gucci gucci on my collar make a new deposit when I'm at the bank
Used to whip in that Impala, now I got a dollar ain't nobody safe

Peek-a-boo, nigga guess who
Legend what you're standing next to
They contemplating on my next move
They commentating on the flesh wound
Niggas sleeping where the bedroom
My number two'll put some lead through 'em
Ready rumble, I will never fumble, I've been in the jungle like I'm Rambo
Guess who came what's on payback
Guess who slide in that Maybach
Guess who don't be in their feelings, only for a feature, <i>[?]</i> nigga eight pack
Pull it up, pull it up, roll it up, light it up
I gotta tighten up, shine on 'em, tell 'em lighten up
'Bout that action like I'm Shia LaBeouf
Why they tryna cage a lion up
All that plotting and the shit they poppin' they can never stop us it was not enough
City poppin' when the boy droppin', niggas kill that noise, they ain't hot as us yeah
SKR SKR, young nigga work (whoo)
Switch up the flow on the verse (Whoo)
Switch up the pan on the vert (Whoo)
Got it right outta the dirt
Hustling first to the first
These niggas might got amnesia
We never ever been equal
I do this here for my people
You probably work for them people
Guess who really know he got it, ain't no doubt about it, ten toes out it
Guess who walkin' in the party diamonds on me I think I got them niggas watchin'
I dare a nigga try to stop me
I might just turn into Rocky
I might just turn into Papi
She tryna play with the cock-y
Young and so full of finesse, young and so full of finesse
Smelling I look like a check, haters are looking depressed
Blessings all over the boy, blessings all over the set
Young and so full of finesse, young and so full of finesse
Who ooh
I've been told to go bad
Free smokin', no pass
Guess who took it independent, taking care of business now I'm on the gas
Guess who back on their windpipe
Back to back what that Bent' like
Back to poppin' like Oxycontin, got a track I'm knockin' after midnight
Guess who grippin' that flavor
Talkin' beef and get cater
Mention me you get major
I fucked her once and you paid her
I let it loose, what you saving
I'm in the coupe, I'm crusading
You better come get your lady
She been on my dick now lately

Guess who came with that bag
Guess who came in that Jag
Guess who came to the club, just to fuck it up, make a hater mad
Guess who came in that Benz, but he leavin' in the Wraith
Guess who kept it one k, guess who never lost faith
If there's a will, there's a way
Count a mill, say good grace
I can see it in your face, I can tell you're a snake
Gucci gucci on my collar make a new deposit when I'm at the bank
Used to whip in that Impala, now I got a dollar ain't nobody safe

Relax, relax, relax, relax
