<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Hey there, you nasty boy, itâs been a minute
And I could say my life has changed since you hit it
This is your strongest trait, you worked a miracle
While they say Iâm sprung, I say "Baby, you did it"

<i>[Hook]</i>
They say you a baller, I hear youâre just a player
And all my friends tell me I should have never dated
But now Iâm in love with you and Iâmma have to tell âem
Quit hatinâ on him, donât be jealous

<i>[Bridge]</i>
(Your world, your world)
Iâm into you boy, it can be
(Your world, your world)
Boy this donât mean that I gotta be
(Your girl, your girl)
Had to take my friend home
My girls, nowhere without my girls, baby

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Hey, first I seen you in a Beamer, and then I saw the Lexus
I knew about the Benzes, with the 20-inch rims on âem
And a lot of ex-girlfriends, I bet they still calling
Well I canât say I blame âem, cause you have something
