Now there you go giving that eye with your hand on my thigh
You got me swerving all over the place
You got me wanting and needing you're the reason for my speeding
And you know you can't blame it on the brakes

Blame it on those baby blues for looking like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' country road romancing
Blame it on the moonlight shining bright tailgate kinda summer night
Blame it on you for loving me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissing me so much
Blame it on those baby blues but you can't blame me for loving you

Hey when the sun goes down on this sleepy little town
You turn my world into a country love song
Take a good long look in the mirror and no it couldn't be any clearer
And you'll see what turns my radio on

Blame it on those baby blues for looking like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' country road romancing
Blame it on the moonlight shining bright tailgate kinda summer night
Blame it on you for loving me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissing me so much
Blame it on those baby blues but you can't blame me for loving you

The way you love me can't get enough of me
Rain or shine all the time with all your heart and soul
I'll be looking in your eyes by the time the sunrise
Comes shining through your bedroom window

You can blame it on those baby blues for looking like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' country road romancing
Blame it on the moonlight shining bright tailgate kinda summer night
Blame it on you for loving me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissing me so much
Blame it on those baby blues but you can't blame me for loving you

No, no matter what you do
Girl you can't blame me for loving you
You can blame it on those baby blues for looking like you do
