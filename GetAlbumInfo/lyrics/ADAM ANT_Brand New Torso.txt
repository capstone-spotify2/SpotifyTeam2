Things get angry
When he thinks of you
That's just enough
To see him through
We took the gamble
And now it must pay off
Got to get even at all cost

More than an attitude
More than a logo
To be a brand new man
With a brand new torso

Whoo, whoo

They try to mould you
And make you soft
So we'll be snipers and pick them off
A pendulum must have its day
We'll see it swinging the other way

More than an attitude
More than a logo
To be a brand new man
With a brand new torso

You should have been born
One hundred years ago
You'd have been a real gun-fighter
in a wild-west show
A teenage menace, a comanchero!

Hey!
You think you're a clever boy
But Iâm the devil you know
Hey!
Live to fight another day
With a brand new torso
Hey!
You think you're a clever boy
But Iâm the devil you know

Live to fight another day
