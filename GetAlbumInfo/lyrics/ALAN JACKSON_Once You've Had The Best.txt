I'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
I can finally go to sleep and get some rest
Never once did I think of finding someone new
'Cause there's nothing better, once you've had the best

You're the very thing they sing about in love songs
And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
As I lay beside you softly sleeping this I know,
There's nothing better, once you've had the best

Within your arms, I've had the best
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger, than all the rest
And there's nothing better, once you've had the best

Within your arms, I've had the best
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger, than all the rest
And there's nothing better, once you've had the best

No there's nothing better, once you've had the best
