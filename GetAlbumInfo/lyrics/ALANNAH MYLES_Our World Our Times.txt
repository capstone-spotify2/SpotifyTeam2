Little tramp comin' up the strip with a hundred dollar smile
Sparks flyin' off her fingertips, drive the young cop wild
Some nights are wound so tight like a storm about to break
Better stand in your doorway when everything starts to shake

You get restless like a cat waking up at midnight,
Hungry, never quite satisfied

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times

Little brother like a street god with a drop dead attitude
Say he's looking like a shadow now, runnin' low on green and food
Some lives are wound up tight like a wave about to crash
Hard times seem to multiply while the joy runs out so fast

You get restless like a kid crawling out of a bad dream
Hungry, never quite satisfied

<i>[chorus repeats 2x]</i>

<i>[Solo]</i>

Make way for the son of a rebel wired to a bottle of flame
He's got two black eyes and a purple heart and a bone hangin' on a chain
These times are like dynamite, a head-on with history
Some fool's bound to burn it all down, don't care about you and me

He'll get desperate like a child in the eye of a nightmare
Hungry, never quite satisfied

<i>[chorus repeats 2x]</i>
