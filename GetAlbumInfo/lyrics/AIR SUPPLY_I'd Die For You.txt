When the shadows spread their wings and chase the day away
The time that is for love I know is near
The mystery we feel will soon surround us
The journey of both laughter and a tear

Sweet memories we make will be forever now
The voices from the past will understand
Waiting for the smile that cuts into me
The fragrance of your hair borne on the wind

I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the panic of our love
We've risen high above it now
I owe it all to you
I'd die for you, I'd die for you

The flames that born as one in time may fall away
The glow that is within will never die
To live without you now, I cannot understand
To live with out you I could not survive

I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the vision of our love
We've risen high above it now

Whenever you hold me the cycle is complete
The secret of eternal love is laid right at our feet

I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the panic of our love
We've risen high above it now
I owe it all to you
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
