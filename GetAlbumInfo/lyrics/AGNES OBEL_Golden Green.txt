All I have or should
Want to be but never could
It's coming at, it's coming at, it's coming at my heart
To spoil my soul with fire

All my eyes can see is
Born out of your imagery
It's coming at, it's coming at, it's coming at my heart
To scorch the earth with fire

Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love

Who are you to take over my mind
With your eyes on me
All for you I am climbing the sky
Of golden green

Angel green and blue
I'm gonna leave my mind with you
It's coming at, it's coming at, it's coming at my heart
I know, I see, I wanna be just free
I know, it craves, it's running through my veins
To spoil my soul with fire

Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love

Who are you to take over my mind
With your eyes on me
All for you I am climbing the sky
Of golden green

Green
Green
Green
