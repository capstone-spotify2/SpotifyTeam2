<i>[Intro:]</i> 
(Sunshine) Feels so good on an easy groove, groove 
Just relax (sunshine) 'cos it feels so free to do, 
to do--I got sunshine

I feel good today--kinda funny in a special way, 
can't quite explain can't seem to get this smile
off my face (smile off my face) Saw your lonely
night--everything's gonna be alright, but right
now I'm gettin' out, steppin' out in the light
(ah, ah, ah, ah) I've got high emotion and it's, 
all for you--got this, crazy notion that you feel
the same way too Got my dreams in motion and a sky
so blue, and I, I don't think it's gonna rain
today--are you coming out to play? 

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
I got sunshine in my life and it shines so bright 
And I feel so high, I can reach the sky 'cos I got
sunshine--oh yeah, I got sunshine Got things to
do, got plans to make for me and you 'cos it's
always cool To find out there's something new
