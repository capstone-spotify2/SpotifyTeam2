When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough of this life
Well, hang on, don't let yourself go
Everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong, now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone, hold on, hold on
If you feel like letting go, hold on
When you think you've had too much of this life, well, hang on

Everybody hurts, take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts, don't throw your hand
Ohh, no, don't throw your hand if you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had
Too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes, so, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
