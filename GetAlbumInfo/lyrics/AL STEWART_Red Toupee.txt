To catalina on a fishing boat
We call it henry cisneros
We got no money but we stay afloat
The jellyfishes don't scare us
You're telling everybody life's a ball
Too many pleasures to mention
You do a cartwheel in the shopping mall
You seem to get their attention

In your red toupee
In your red toupee

You take your number to a broadway play
It keeps her well out of danger
You're blowing bubbles in the matinee
You never looked any stranger 

In your red toupee
In your red toupee

People say that you're unusual
You just tell them they're confused
If only they were more like you
They'd brighten up their day

In your red toupee
In your red toupee

Promenades in furs and laces
People put on airs and graces
Bedroom eyes in boardroom faces
Oh where will it lead

To catalina on a fishing boat
We call it henry cisneros
We got no money but we stay afloat
Those jellyfishes don't scare us

In our red toupees
Oh we got our red toupees
In your mauve toupee
Turquoise toupee
In your green toupee
Cerise toupee
Why are you wearing that strange toupee
