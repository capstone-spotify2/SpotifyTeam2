When you were wrapped in tangles
I was free
And when you were undecided
I believed
It's alright, tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
The shapes that go together
You and I

When you were filled with longing
I belonged
When you were weak from trying
I was strong
But it's alright, tonight
On a deep blue mountain high

The shapes that go together
You and I
The shapes that go together
You and I

Childhood winters
Come to me
Whisper softly
So tenderly

I know, I walked 25 miles to hold you
Just to find you'd moved away

When you were wrapped in tangles
I was free
And when you were almost blinded
I could see
But it's alright, tonight
On a deep blue mountain high

The shapes that go together
You and I
The shapes that go together
You and I
You and I (The shapes that go together)
