Are you up in the middle of the night trying to figure out where things went wrong
And they did
Just another semi-bummer weekend
It seems hard to find a home for the words, though i'm sure they make complete sense 
In your head
It's a light hearted movie with a splash of calamity

And when i dig too deep / when i get too high
I never ask of you, i'll ask of...
And when i talk too much / don't talk enough
I never ask of you, i'll ask of...
And when i fall apart over the weekend
And the pills begin to stop working
And when i'm not in line / just too aligned
I never ask of you, i'll ask of...
I never ask of you, i'll ask of...

And just like that, we'll snap our hands and all will turn to white,
On white 
Does everything have to be such a tragedy?
Lets sum the world into one clever line, 
And sell it back at double their asking price, or triple
It's a crazy world, someone should sell some tickets

I saw you again last night, sidewalking junkie filled with hazy thoughts, oh yeah
Beginning of my snow storm daydream
You're a drug hit to my sanity an acid trip to my well being, yeah, yeah, yeah
As the docters prescribed, a well-mannered lad
In the ever growing well-mannered fad
