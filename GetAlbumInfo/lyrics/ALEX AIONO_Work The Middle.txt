Come and meet me with the lights low
Where it's just me and you
Girl, take me to the night show
Give me a front row view
Baby, don't say no, no, no, no
You know what I wanna do, yeah
I could be your maestro and never play you for a fool

Oh, yeah, I'm three seconds from way too gone. I know
And I'm two seconds from blowing up your phone
You're the one I wanna see when I get home
Don't leave me alone

Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little...

Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, I, oh, I

After a little photo
I keep my eyes glued to you
Don't keep me waiting solo
I already ditched the crew
Baby, don't say no, no, no, no
You know what I wanna do, wanna do for you, wanna do for you, yeah

Oh, yeah, I'm three seconds from way too gone. I know
And I'm two seconds from blowing up your phone
You're the one I wanna see when I get home
Don't leave me alone

Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little...

Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, I, oh, I
Come and meet me, yeah

Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Come and meet me at the after-party
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little... hey!

Now it's just me and you, girl
Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, I, oh, I
It's just me and you, girl
