Tempted and tried, weâre oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long,
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Farther along weâll know all about it,
Farther along weâll understand why;
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
Weâll understand it all by and by.

When we see Jesus, coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky,
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,
Weâll understand it all by and by.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
