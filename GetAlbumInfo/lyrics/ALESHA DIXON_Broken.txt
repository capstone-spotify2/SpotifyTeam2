I know you're scared, life's a mess
Done with fighting that lonely silence
A life long test beating you to death
I know you're tired and done with trying
When it aches, don't let it break you
When it hurts, you gotta learn to smile again
Gotta let it brain
Chase the fear away

You're not broken
You've gotta get up if you've fallen
You're hurt now but you're not broken
Let your love lift you
You're hurt, you're not broken

Not going out, stuck inside a drought
Internally bleeding, letting anger pull you down
Not to blame, no matter what they say
You don't wanna, don't wanna be here anymore
When it aches, don't let it break you
And when it hurts, you gotta learn to smile again
Chase the fear away
Cause life is changing, you gotta let it 

You're not broken
You've gotta get up if you've fallen
You're hurt now but you're not broken
Let your love lift you
You're hurt, you're not broken

It's the merry-go-round
Struggling, it's hard to breathe
Because you'll last who you are
One day you'll back and you'll see
Just surrender

You're not broken
You've gotta get up if you've fallen
You're hurt now but you're not broken
Let the love within your heart be the light that will lift you
You're hurt, you're not broken

When the rain pours down on you
I promise sunlight will break through
