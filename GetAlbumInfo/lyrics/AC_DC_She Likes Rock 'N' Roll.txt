A little game
Of falling down
You rock 'n' roll
When the call come 'round
Come on baby, and make some time
Made in the shade and you wish it'd turn around
You're gonna rock, you'll rock the night away
You're gonna roll baby, and I'll make the grade
We gonna rock now, rockin' n rollin' all in the town
You're gonna make it right
We're gonna need to rock all night

She digs rock n roll
She likes rock n roll
You want rock n roll
I need rock n roll
Everyday
And all through the night

We are a gang coming down
We're gonna rock all night
Rock n rollin' all the time
She may be home, rollin' out the groove
You know that rock n roll's squeezing out the tube

She digs rock n roll
She likes rock n roll
You want rock n roll
And I need rock n roll
Everyday
And all through the night

She digs rock n roll
She gives rock n roll
She gives rock n roll
I like rock n roll

I gotta dance all night long
And rock into the room
She likes sugar
And I like honey too
We gonna rock it
Ain't gonna mess around with you

She digs rock n roll
She likes rock n roll
You want rock n roll
I need rock n roll
Everyday
And all through the night

She digs rock n roll
She gives rock n roll
She lives rock n roll
I like rock n roll

We gonna rock 'round
Rockin' rollin' all in the town
We're gonna make it right
We're gonna make it rock all night
We're gonna rock 'round
Rockin' rollin' all in the town
We're gonna make it right
We're gonna make it rock all night
