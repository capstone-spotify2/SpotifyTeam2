Two thousand miles of blacktop 
One hundred medium coffee cups 
Seven lonely sunsets that 
Could almost make you cry 
Late night gospels on the radio 
Haven't seen a car in an hour or so
Your picture on the dashboard 
Sure does make the miles go by 
I've got a heart that's running
On a half a tank of gas 
Four bald tires and I'm low on cash
Still there's one sweet thought 
To get me through
At the end of this road I'm gonna see you 
I blew by both Dakotas 
Nebraska I barely noticed 
I covered Colorado in close to record time 
I'm almost at the homestretch
My eyes are tired and I need a rest 
But I ain't gonna sleep my best
Until I'm at your side 
I've got a heart that's running 
On a half a tank of gas
Four bald tires and I'm low on cash 
| Still there's one sweet thought 
To get me through 
At the end of this road
I'm gonna see you I've got a heart that's running
On a half a tank of gas 
Four bald tires and I'm low on cash
Still there's one sweet thought 
To get me through 
At the end of this road
I'm gonna see you
At the end of this road, I'm gonna see you
