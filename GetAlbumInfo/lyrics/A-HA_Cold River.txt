I took a ride in an automobile
Pushed my hands out against the wheel

Asked a girl if she needed a ride
She said, "Sure, babe, but I wanna drive"

Hey now, wait awhile
We're going down with a smile
Cold river - she took me down
Cold river - she took my pride

River runs so deep
It runs so deep
It runs so deep

Had to stop on account of the storm
Seemed like years since I'd been warm

We drove all night till the tires blew
Got in the back and did what you do

Hey now, wait awhile
We're going down with a smile
Cold river -- she took me down
Cold river -- she took my pride
On a sunny day
On a sunny day
(She took my pride)
All the money you made
Did you need it, babe
