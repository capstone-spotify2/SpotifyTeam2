Take a look and see
What's become of me
Remember how it used to be

People that we'd meet
Were falling at your feet
You didn't eve see it

Time marches on ahead - enough said
There's only one way through it
Time marches on ahead - one day we'll see it
How there's a fine blue line
Running through it

We read each other's books
We gave each other looks
Like we couldn't trust ourselves
And we knew it

So tell me where you've been
And I'll show you were you're going
You can shout, you can scream
Your way through it...

Well time rushes an ahead - enough said
That's just the way we blew it
Time marches on ahead - one day you'll see it;
Love is a fine blue line

Time races on ahead - enough said
That's just the way we blew it
Time marches on ahead - one day you'll see it
Love is the fine blue line
Running through it
