Hey, where you goin' to?
I can see by your eyes
You've had enough of my lies
What you gonna do?

But wait! Please, don't go that way
I'm down on my knees
Can I beg you please?
One more time to stay, stay

No! Never go away
Your eyes I'd see everywhere
Till my dyin' day

So please! I'm down on my knees
No more lies you hear
No cry and tears
Oh I beg you please, please

If you go away then I'd be lonely
Thinkin' about your eyes
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss
All those empty lies

Don't wanna be lonely
Forever without your love
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss
Baby, you're my love, oh oh

Babe, I'm still lonely
Thinkin' about your eyes
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss
All those empty lies

Don't wanna be lonely
Forever without your love
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss
Baby, you're my love

Baby, you're my love
Baby, you're my love
Baby, you're my love
