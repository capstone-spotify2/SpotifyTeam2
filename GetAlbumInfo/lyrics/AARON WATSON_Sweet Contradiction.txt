Shes as pure as a sunday morning
Just as fun as a saturday night
Shes as pretty as a stain glass window
Shes always shining like a neon light

When I'm holding her here in my arms
I feel as if there's nothing i cant do
But just the thought of her leaving me
Leaves me helpless and broken in two

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My sweet contradiction knows well the chains that bind me
My cure and my addiction is her love and only her love
Can set me free

And no I don't understand what did I do to deserve to be her man
Shes such an angel so why is she flying so low
So she can love someone like me

<i>[Repeat chorus]</i>

<i>[Repeat first verse]</i>

Yeah shes my sweet, shes so sweet
Shes my sweet contradiction
That girl is sweet, shes so sweet
Shes my sweet contradiction
