Iâll be the bad guy,
Iâll take the black eye,
When I walk out,
You can slam the door,
Iâll be the S.O.B,
If thatâs what you need from me,
So you donât have to love me anymore.

When you and our friends talk,
Make it all my fault,
Tell âem Iâm rotten to the core,
Iâll let it all slide,
Get âem all on your side,
So you donât have to love me anymore.

I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They wonât even cross your mind.

If the wine youâre drinkinâ,
Leads you to thinkinâ,
That you want what we had before,
Girl you can call me,
Iâll let it ring and ring,
So you donât have to love me anymore.

Yeah, I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They wonât even cross your mind.

If you need me to make you cry,
I donât want to but Iâll try,
So you donât have to love me anymore.
