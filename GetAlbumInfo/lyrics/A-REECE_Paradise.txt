Rolling up a 8th like every day and ma don't even know it
I'm hella sick but all we sip is medication with the soda
So much of it
That I'm unfamiliar with being sober
Fucking women who complain about my age because they older

I can't afford to pull up on my own
I need my soldiers
I can't pull up and leave the store before meeting the owner
<i>[x2]</i>

What a life
Paradise
Saucing through the day and keep it drippin
Come alive
In the night
Sentsane re le bale ba Pitori no lie
I'm so high
Every time I close my eyes I end up screaming
What a life
Paradise
What a time

I'm living in a future I predicted somewhere back in 2011
Watching BET and KOTD practicing and prepping
What a dream
Look how I maneuver through the pressure
Look how they elude me to a legend
Know how fearless Jody told your ass that Imma do it better
Back to Back yeah he's singing kinda rap
They can never put me in a box or under they umbrella
They specific with the seasons I go hard from January to December
What a team..
Ambitious entertainment till forever
Ironic how this label got me feeling independent
I'm sorry but how we are always winning is intended
I'm paranoid, it feels like all these niggas want us dead
And now I

Can't afford to pull up on my own
I need my soldiers
I can't pull up and leave the store before meeting the owner

What a life
Paradise
Saucing through the day and keep it drippin
Come alive
In the night
Sentsane re le bale ba Pitori no lie
I'm so high
Every time I close my eyes I end up screaming
What a life
Paradise
What a time

I'm living in the present moment thinking bout my future e-n-deavors
Best believe that it'll happen if I said it on the record
Pardon me
I really hope you understand the message
My verses are all value buyers use this shit as leverage
Always quick to move cause I was told its now or never
If the weather ever changes then my reign has elevated
What a scene
Pull up knowing that I'm highly favoured
Life is different here's a list of what I do from day to day
I'm rolling up a 8th like every day
Ma don't even know
Hella sick but all we sip is medication with the soda
So much of it
I'm unfamiliar with being sober
Fucking women who complain about my age because they older

I can't afford to pull up on my own
I need my soldiers
I can't pull up and leave the store before meeting the owner

What a life
Paradise
Saucing through the day and keep it drippin
Come alive
In the night
Sentsane re le bale ba Pitori no lie
I'm so high
Every time I close my eyes I end up screaming
What a life
Paradise
What a time

I could have changed the flow but I thought fuck it might as well just keep it going
I am at a point in life where I do what the fuck I wanna
Been consistent
Hella driven
Inspiration is the chauffeur
I'm going in and I ain't coming back until it's over
Went from I don't know your name, to people acting like they know us
And now we hit the stage and shut it down until the the morning
Got the city on my back
Looking like I'm Quasimodo
Kicking raps and throwing punches
Now the stu is like the dojo
What that mean?
You say my name, you prolly pushing promo
No pro-bono shows and those the pros of working like a Pro
Getting money, never going broke is obviously the motive
My life is so important I got haters who decode it
This is me
If you ain't even know it
Now you know it
Yeah I am in the moment
Get the camera start recording
This is me
If you ain't even know it
Now you know
Cause I am in the moment
Get the camera start recording

What a life
Paradise
Saucing through the day and keep it drippin
Come alive
In the night
Sentsane re le bale ba Pitori no lie
I'm so high
Every time I close my eyes I end up screaming
What a life
Paradise
What a time
