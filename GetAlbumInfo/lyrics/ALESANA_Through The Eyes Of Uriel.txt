On the edge of reason, beyond understanding
Silent she waits, perfect oblivion
Sheâs crawling to the end, perfect oblivion

I live behind mirrors within a prison without any bars
Yet I remain lost to the world
In hell Iâm suspended within a prism
So many walls, so many years, so many lives
Too often Iâve watched them die

Images of yesterday feeling so far away

I canât let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance
I need you more tonight than you will ever know
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance

The hell of being trapped is simply not a match for death
Heaven awaits
Now I know not to be afraid of the end
My love awaits, will you be there? Take me away
Iâm ready, Iâll be home soon

Images of yesterday feeling so far away

I canât let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance
I need you more tonight than you will ever know
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance

beautiful pure silence, come on! Embrace me
sweet perfect nothing swallow my fears, come on!
If I had just one wish Iâd choke prophets, hang angels, burn children
oh, Iâd drink oceans, eat the moon, flood the world, end everything

breathe in, breathe out
we could run far away but then how would we sleep at night?

Iâve been looking for the words to say our last goodbyes
Hold on to fleeting hopes that I just might survive

Give in to the pleasure
make it last forever
Hold on hold on to everything we are
