I'm down on the floor, there's a man at the door
He won't let me in 'cause he thinks he's the law
He'll give me a shout when he's figured it out
Gotta pick myself up, what am I waiting for?
It's never enough, yeah it's never too late
I reminded myself that I'm starting again
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"

And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time
Why can't I be just like the people that I know?

I've got what it takes, I'm bang up to date
You know how it is, I'm all over the place
Kicked in the face, I'm backstage, everyone here is half of my age
Standing in line, I'm hitching a ride
I'll give it a try but I don't have the time
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"

And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time
Why can't I be just like the people that I know

Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na

Telling Me Never... It Should Be Whatever

And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time and....

Why can't I be just like the people that I know

And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time and

I'm always up on time and <i>[x20]</i>
