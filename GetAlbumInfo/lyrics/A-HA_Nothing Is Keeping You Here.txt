The lights change on the hill
The air seems strangely still
Everyoneâs asleep

The floorboards creak at dawn
As you walk out on the lawn
The grass is wet beneath

You think it rather strange
You think it rather weird
Itâs fair to say that
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here

The phone is off the hook
As you sink into a book
You donât know where you are

From the world; detached
Unto a girl you latched
It never got too far

And everybody talks
And everybody stares
Itâs safe to say that
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here

And everybodyâs dawn
And everybody cares
You knew your day to shine
Would come without you here

Come without you here...
Nothing was keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
