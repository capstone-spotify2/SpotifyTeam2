I dont know who but it wasnt me
He wasnt all you'd thought he be
And then broke your heart, girl you should have let me know coz you left it kind of hard for me to show
Just how it feels when i'm next to you coz them other girls aint nothing next to you no doubt in my mind coz i know its you
So tell me its what you wanna do

Coz loving you girl
Is all that i know, why would i lie
If you want me to i'll give you just a little more time to decide
If i could be, your anything coz you to me are everything

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I'm talking to the mirror at 5am
Waiting for your call in the pouring rain sugar coated kiss and a lipstick mark there are 7 ways of breaking my heart
Loaded conversation and bad tv loosing our original chemistry walking like i'm dancing on priceless art there are 7 ways of
Breaking my heart 

Turn of the tv
We need t talk about the way coz i thought i heard you say something bout not being there for you s what do i have to do to
Show that i care for youi'm saying i could be the one no more playing girls for fun baby let me prove i got just what you
Need if you give me half a chance to romance you coz you make me feel complete

Coz loving you girl
Is all that i know, why would i lie
If you want me to i'll give you just a little more time to decide
If i could be, your anything coz you to me are everything

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I'm talking to the mirror at 5am
Waiting for your call in the pouring rain sugar coated kiss and a lipstick mark there are 7 ways of breaking my heart
Loaded conversation and bad tv loosing our original chemistry walking like i'm dancing on priceless art there are 7 ways of
Breaking my heart

Something i said or didnt mention slow down- to damn fast bouncewith another chick with a fine ass not me, got the other
Girl on hold i was on line 2 she was going all cold
