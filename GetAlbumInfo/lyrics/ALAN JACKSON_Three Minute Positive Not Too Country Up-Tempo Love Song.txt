This is a three minute song
To tell her that I love her
And how wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline slick
A lotta right and not much wrong

It's a little bit edgy, but softer than spaghetti
Weak yet redundantly strong
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song

Yeah, it's a three minute positive
Not to country up-tempo love song
It's a way to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
There'll be no drinkin', no cheatin',
No lyin', no leavin'
That stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too county up-tempo love song

You won't hear four-letter words
Just me tellin' her
That she's the every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her
And I could never doubt her
'Cause she could never do no wrong

Well it's the right amount of timin'
The proper form of rhymin'
A little guitar then it's gone
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song

Yeah, it's a three minute positive
Not to country up-tempo love song
It's a way to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
There'll be no drinkin', no cheatin',
No lyin', no leavin'
That stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too county up-tempo love song

Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
There'll be no drinkin', no cheatin',
No lyin', no leavin'
That stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
