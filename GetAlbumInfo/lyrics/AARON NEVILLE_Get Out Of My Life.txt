Get out of my life, leave me alone
Don't write me no letter, don't call me on the phone
Well, I'm trying to forget that I love you so
So let me down easy baby, just let me go

You played a game, I was a fool
When I see you with someone else, I just keep my cool
And now I'm trying to forget that I love you so
So let me down easy baby, just let me go

Well I'm alone now, as long as I could
I went along with your program, like you knew I would
But one of these days now, I say now it won't be long
You're gonna look for me and honey child, you know baby I'll be gone

Get out of my life, leave me alone
Don't write me no letter, don't call me on the phone
Well I'm trying to forget that I love you so
So let me down easy baby, just let me go

Well, I'm trying to forget that I love you so
So let me down easy baby, just let me go
I said let me go baby
Come on, come on, let me go now
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, whoa
