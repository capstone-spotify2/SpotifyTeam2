There's a place on Starowka
Lots of people live there
Not supposed to, government says no
But they don't care

The sirens blare, apocalypse
Musicians still play on
They don't know who their god is now
They only know this song

In all of Warsaw's grandeur
In the eyes of the ancient soul
We call upon our ancestors to sanctify this hall

They do the dance 
They do the dance of love
Into each other's arms they fall
They do the dance of love
Oni robie tan ice milosci

We move into the light
We got to set our beings free
We scream our indiscretions
A glorious reprieve

Hold me in your last embrace
Escape the king of doom
Who will hold our hand through time
When the rose has lost it's bloom

In all of Warsaw's grandeur
In the eyes of the ancient soul
We call upon our ancestors to sanctify this hall

We do the dance, we do the dance of love
Into each other's arms we fall
We do the dance of love
Into each other's arms we fall
We do the dance of love

Hold me in your last embrace
Escape the king of doom
Who will hold our hand through time
When the dance has left this room
