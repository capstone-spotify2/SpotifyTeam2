You can't
You won't
Ak-nel
You can't
You won't

<i>[Curly - Refrain]</i>
Something is what you meet standing up on the corner
Lay out
And when you think of my spliff
You think something has comeover
Lay out
I say
Here I am what I'm going to do
Yes I've got these dreams to come true
And the way you embrace me
It makes me want to crossover
Lay out

<i>[Curly 2x]</i>
Sha La La La (la la la)
La la la (la la la)
La la la (la la la)

<i>[Akinyele]</i>
Ha it's the hardcoe rhymers
Straightening niggas out like recliners
You dicks get sprayedlike stun
I use your blood to paint the walls like period vagina
Remind us
Of signers
When we busting you up
Bullets like allergies
Straight stuffinf you up
Can I touch any he or she that try to diss this
Once I clutch the grammy in my hand like stick shift
Or professor
I'm putting niggas in a stretcher
Tell your crew
I play them boys ou like fucking Hugh Hefner
It ain't nothing
My guns part authority
Cause they be busting
I could feel or catch a wreck like your part buttons

<i>[Curly - Hook]</i>
<i>[2x]</i>
Cause were rough
Were rough
Tough
Were tough
We are danger (danger straight dangerous)
<i>[2x]</i>
Sha la la la (la la la)
La la la (la la la)
La la la (la la la)

<i>[Akinyele]</i>
When it's dark
It's the <i>[?]</i> parts
That I be walking in
Be clocking you and dropping you
Like dr. Kevorkian
My hobby is to hit you
With guns in the hand
In my left
Putting bullets in your chest
Like Bobby Fisher
I wish a
Nigga
Want to contest this
Wet you up like star water
You fellas is fish
Trying to go up again
To fall from an intense nigga
To stab you with a dagger
Reagardless if you stagger
I still going to jab you with the marvelous <i>[?]</i>
Like Agler
Making your ass fall like Niagara
My trigger finger that damage
Advantaged niggas
Like Abracadabra
What
The AK
The glock nine
Making niggas slow down and what not
Similar to stop signs
Money and crimes
On my mind
I murder silly jokes
For they choke
And all you ever find
Is their body outlined
In white lines
