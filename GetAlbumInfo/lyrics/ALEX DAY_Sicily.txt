Sat in peaceful scenery
The city lights shine bright around me
The smell of last night's dinner is still breezing through the air
Dozing in tranquility
The morning sun hangs high above me
Clicking camera shutters catch bewildered foreign stares

And I must be away from my home
But it feels so close to me
And I must be away from my home
But it feels so close to me

Clifftop is our tapestry
The sunlit sky does well to cool me
Drifting past the villas in a coach without a care
Blackjack in serenity
Fellow makers ride beside me
Walking through an archway and admiring what lies there

And I must be away from my home
But it feels so close to me
And I must be away from my home
But it feels so close to me

Sat in peaceful scenery
The city lights shine bright around me
Smell of last night's dinner is still breezing through the air
Through the air
