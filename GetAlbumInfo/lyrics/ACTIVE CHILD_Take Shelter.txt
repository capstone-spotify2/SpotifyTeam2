If youâre ever on the wrong side of this town
Thereâs some place that I know of that will hold you down
Travel south through the city avoiding all the passing cars
Streets are wrong, streets are trying to tear you up
If youâre even in need of a helping hand
Thereâs some people that I know of that will be your friend
Travel south through the city to the wrong turn signals
Streets are wrong, streets are trying to tear you up
As I go ooh, take shelter in my arms
Ooh, take shelter in my arms
If youâre afraid in the world
If youâre afraid in the world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
Youâll feel safer in my arms
Youâll feel safer
Youâll feel safer
If youâre afraid
If youâre afraid in this world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
Youâll be safer in my arms
Youâll be safer
Youâll be safer
If youâre afraid in this world
If youâre afraid in the world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
Youâll be safer in my arms
Youâll be safer
