<i>[Chorus]</i>
I told my ma, about the town I love so well 
I told my ma, about the town I love 
My time will come, raising up my family 
I told my ma, about the town I love 

Iâm leaving for an island, way down in the south 
where the roads are curved and dusty with no names 
The peopleâs so inviting, theyâre smiling everywhere 
With a tempo I can share 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'd like to get together, where there's samba in the streets 
in a tropical favela to the beats 
in Santa Catarina, a hot summer night 
are you ready, to ignite? 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I said 
Oh oh hungry eyes, hungry eyes 
My apprise, all for you 
Oh, hungry eyes 
Until the morningâs arise 

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
