Why breathe a word
When no one needs to know
Why say a thing
To another living soul

Let us pay no mind
To a world that seems unkind
For here is something to shelter
Now more than ever

Shadow endeavours
Our shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours

Why leave us open
And naked to the sun
Why draw their fire
That theyâll surely reign upon us

Let us pay no mind
To their words and bitter lines
For hereâs something to shelter
And now more than ever

Shadow endeavours
These shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
Shadow endeavours
More than ever
Shadow endeavours

Only ever happened to me once
It doesnât come again
I think somebody left me here
Afraid and lonely
A long time ago

Only ever happened to me once
It doesnât come again
I think somebody left me here
Afraid and lonely
A long time ago
