<i>[2x]</i>
I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side,
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind.

All I feel is silence now
Taking over, taking over, taking over.
All I see is black clouds of doubt
Taking over, taking over, taking over.

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side,
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind.

All I feel is silence now
Taking over, taking over, taking over.

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me
