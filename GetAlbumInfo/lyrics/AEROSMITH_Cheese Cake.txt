I met a babe in a backseat drive-in 
Back in the saddle she'd sit 
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin' 
She loved to chomp at the bit 

Daddy do it, ooh, just do it 
Daddy do it, please let me see 
Do it, please just do it daddy 
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy 

She always walks with her eyes 
Down on her bootlace 
She lives to give it away 
She don't believe in the right time or the wrong place 
She's always liable to say 

Daddy do it, ooh, just do it 
Daddy do it, please let me see 
Do it, please just do it daddy 
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy 

Cheese cake, looser than her sister 
Cheese cake, uum...her sugar gets me high 
She knows I can't resist her 
Cheese cake 
Got my fingers in her pie 
Cheese cake 
Cheese cake, sneakin' out the back door 
Cheese cake, rollin' down the lawn 
Everybody kissed her, cheese cake 
Oh, at the crack of dawn, cheese cake 

Daddy do it, ooh, just do it 
Daddy do it, please let me see 
Daddy do it, please just do it daddy 
Do it, do it, do it, drivin' me crazy 

Cheese cake, looser than her sister 
Cheese cake, uum...her sugar gets me high 
She knows I can't resist her 
Cheese cake 
Got my fingers in her pie 
Cheese cake 

Cheese cake
Cheese cake
Cheese cake
Cheese cake
Cheese cake
Cheese cake
Cheese cake 
Cheese cake
