Do you like good boogie 
Like a real boogie woogie 
Hear the juke box singin' 
A get the dance hall swingin' 
A won't you grab my shaker 
I got to meet your maker 
Uumm get out the lead 
Get out on up there 
Get the lead out 

(Get ready), I'll show you my fist 
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist 
(Get ready), we really can't miss 
(Get ready) 

Uumm, hey good lookin' 
A what cha got there cookin' 
You a young spring chicken 
A make your feet start kickin' 

no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no 

(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)

Oh, hey good lookin' 
A what cha got there cookin' 

Hey good lookin'
A what cha got there cookin'
You a young spring chicken 
A make your feet start kickin' 
Boot it out, dance without me 

No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no
