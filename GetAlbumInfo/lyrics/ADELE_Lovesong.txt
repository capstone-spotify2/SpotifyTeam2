<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you

I'll always love you
I'll always love you
Cause I love you
Love, love, love...
