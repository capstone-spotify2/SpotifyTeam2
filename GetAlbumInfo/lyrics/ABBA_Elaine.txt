You hate, you scream, you swear
And still you never reach him
You curse, you try to scare
But you can never teach him
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You know they're gonna get you
You try to break away
But they will never let you
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul

You come, you stay, you go
It really doesn't matter
You've done it all before
By now they'll know the pattern
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul
Now that you're gone, you know they're gonna get you
Now that you're gone, you know they'll never let you

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet

A nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul
Now that you're gone, you know they're gonna get you
Now that you're gone, you know they'll never let you
