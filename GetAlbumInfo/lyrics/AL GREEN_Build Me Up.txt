Ah, you build me up, build me up and
Just to let me down, let me down and
Then you fill my cup, fill my cup and
Turn my love around, all around

Well, I love you, um, love you and that will survive

Why do you have to start, have to start that
Just to break my heart, break my heart, oh?
Tear it all apart, all apart and
Then you let it stop, let it stop

I can't stand it, baby, you, you move me so
And my love gets started, it goes and goes and goes and
This is not a dream and what love ought to make
Sometimes you just can see <i>[?]</i>

Don't have the Eiffel Tower or silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is worth more and more and more

I want to stay this time
I, oh, wanna make you mine
And now, yeah, want to stay this time, yeah
I wanna make you mine

And I love you, baby, I
