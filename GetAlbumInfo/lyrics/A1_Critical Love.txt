Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love <i>[2x]</i>

We can stay up all night by the moonlight
Watch the sunrise with the butterflies
We can fight all night, we can yell and cry
We never say goodbye
We're always side by side

I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...

Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love <i>[4x]</i>

Some days we are afraid of waves
Some days we surf 'em!
You and me, we have our days
And I don't wanna lose them

I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...

So..
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love <i>[4x]</i>

We can, we can fall down,
Down, down, down
We never, we never hit the ground
Ground, ground, ground
Somehow (somehow), we always get up
Up, up, up (yeah)
Sometimes (sometimes), even to the top (even to the top...)
I will go where you go
