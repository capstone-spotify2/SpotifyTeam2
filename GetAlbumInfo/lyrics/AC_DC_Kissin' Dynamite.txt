Here she come here she come
Eatin' up the thrill
Sugarcane sugarcane
Dressin' up to kill
Like a fireball in the shadow
Like a storm that's gonna show
Like an overwound volcano
Gettin' set to blow
Set to blow
She got a nasty reputation
She got a healthy appetite
When she need some detonation
She set the fuse alight
The fuse alight
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

Let it rain let it rain
Let me feel it pour
Let it slide let it slide
Let me feel the core
Like the thunder in the mountain
Like the lightnin' in the sky
Like the eye of a tornado
She watch it all go by
All go by
Then she come for recreation
And she play her games at night
She wanna work on her vocation
She set the world alight
Set the world alight
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

Here she come, here she come
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Here it come, about to blow
Just falling on you like a volcano
She got imagination on recreation
That's the way you want it
That's the way to go
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Baby I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Yeah feel like kissin' dynamite
