I'll watch it all go down in flames
Knowin' there's no one to blame but me
Another vice to kill the pain
Knowin' that the pain will set me free

So I sit here starin' at the sky, and wonder why
The hands of God still hold me, and help me through this life
A sinner in so many ways, I've made it through so many days
I struggle, still lookin' for a sign

A little purpose
The story of my life

I'm haunted by the words you said
Prayin' that there's any hope for me
This holy war inside my head
Is probably not the safest place to be

So I sit here starin' at the sky, and wonder why
The hands of God still hold me, and help me through this life
A sinner in so many ways, I've made it through so many days
I struggle, still lookin' for a sign

A little purpose
The story of my life
The story of my life

So as the darkness turns to day
The light it shows the depth of my disguise
My safety was naivety
Created by deception and with lies

So I sit here starin' at the sky, and wonder why
The hands of God still hold me, and help me through this life
I'm a sinner in so many ways, I've made it through so many days
I struggle, still lookin' for a sign

A little purpose
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
