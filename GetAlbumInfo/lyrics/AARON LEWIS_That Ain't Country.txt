What a sad state of affairs I'm in
Cause I'm trying to compete where I just don't fit in
Cause the country, if you call it that, from off the road
Ain't country just because I'm old enough to know that

That ain't country
That's a natural fact
It's full of tails of good times and happy endings
My life ain't like that
So I'll keep listening to the old songs that my Grandad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today

So tell me, whatever happened to the country songs
Full of truth and consequences, all the things gone wrong
Someone came and changed it up, made it all a lie
I'd like to spit a little beach-nut right in that dude's eye

Cause that ain't country
That's a natural fact
It's full of tails of good times and happy endings
My life ain't like that
So I'll keep listening to the old songs that my Grandad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today

Now listen here
We got Waylon singing songs bout a Ramblin' Man
And Junior's got a cold one in his hand
And the Possum's gettin drunk again imagine that
And Charlie Daniels playing fiddle underneath that hat
And John and June are goin' back and forth again
And David Allan Coe is singing 'bout his kin
And Haggard sings the songs that'll save your soul
And Willie sings the songs about the hearts he stole

Cause that shit's country
That's a natural fact
It's full of tails of hard times and complications
Ain't life like that?
So I'll keep listening to the old songs that my Grandad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today
The ones that speak to me
The way I feel today
