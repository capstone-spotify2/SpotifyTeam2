Were you dying to go? You just looked so exposed, 
demure through the dark dancing lights. 
I glided by. 
I can't deny that the shadows betrayed you and I on that night.

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed. 
Are you not impressed? 
Darling I want to.
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth, 
this is all for you. 
Darling I want to destroy you.

As you reached for my hand 
did you then understand? 
It was I who would lead you that night. 
When you begged to know I was glad to show 
that I needn't be scared, 
either way I still bight.

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed. 
Are you not impressed? 
Darling I want to.
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth, 
this is all for you. 
Darling I want to...

So here's the final scene when I finally come clean. 
I've watched you for years. 
And here's my favorite part, where you beg for my heart 
and I disappear.

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed. 
Are you not impressed? 
Darling I want to.
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth, 
this is all for you. 
Darling I want to
Darling I want to destroy you.
