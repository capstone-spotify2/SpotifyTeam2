Man - I know that you're out in the crowd
And I feel how you burn you hate in my soul
It's like I'd have my hand in your arms
And feel the stainless start of a second
Years - have gone by I know that she's left you
Before I passed by
Man - it's been a long time since you've lost her
heart
Yes - it's been a long time since you've lost her
heart
Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for some long - for so long
Man - why are you running blind for the past
Why don't you try to understand
When I found her she was dying
Trying to kill herself
May be you didn't know what you've done
But all you wanna do is wrong
Man - you came to kill, for someone who's gone
Man - it's been a long time since you've lost her
heart
Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for some long
Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for some long
