I come quietly. Silent entities
Can lack a certain weight when unseen.
Do they speak of me?
My voice left with the breeze that
Whispered "you should flee or you shall be seen."

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

I am everywhere, everywhere but here,
For here is where you grace the nameless.
Were I not so weak, could I even speak
I'd warn that you should leave before
You're seen with me.

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

Will you pause to break my heart?
Will you pause?

I am everywhere,
Everywhere but here.
I am everywhere,
Everywhere but here.

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause?

I'd die
If you only met my eyes.
Before you pass by,
Will you pause to break my heart?

Will you pause to break my heart?
Will you pause?
