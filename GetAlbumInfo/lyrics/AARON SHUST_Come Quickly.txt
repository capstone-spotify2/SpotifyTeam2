Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You
Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You

Our souls are weary
Our hearts are thirsty
Only You can satisfy
Our cup is empty
Our burden heavy
Youâre the well that wonât run dry

We need a rescue from above
We need a rescue from above

Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You
Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You

You are the answer
You are the healer
Youâre the lifter of our heads
And though we falter
Still You are faithful
Youâre the shelter in the storm

We need a rescue from above
We need a rescue from above

Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You
Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You

You can calm the storm
Walk above the waves
You can move the mountains
You can move the mountains
Speaking out Your word
Walls are coming down
You can move the mountains
You can move the mountains

Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You
Come quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Jesus
All we need is You
