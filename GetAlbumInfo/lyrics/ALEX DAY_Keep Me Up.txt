It feels like we've been through a hundred different lives together.
Despite how dark it gets we share a smile and things feel better.
You're still believing after everything that we have been through.
While your still breathing wake each morning to protect you.

I've been scared everyday, you could turn and run away.
Let's take our time, for it won't be too long now.
Don't give up, don't give up and we will be repaired.
Stay by my side, for I am not that strong now.
Keep me up, keep me up and handle me with care.

You were still sleeping by the time I came to life this morning.
My ears were filled with what was left of what had been your snoring.
And as I watched you lie so peacefully I knew that there'd be,
A day when we would be at rest just like I knew we could be.

But I've been scared every day, you could turn and run away.
Let's take our time, for it won't be too long now.
Don't give up, don't give up and we will be repaired.
Stay by my side for I am not that strong now.
Keep me up, keep me up and handle me with care.

Let's take our time, for it won't be too long now.
Don't give up, don't give up and we will be repaired.
Stay by my side for I am not that strong now.
Keep me up, keep me up and handle me with care.
