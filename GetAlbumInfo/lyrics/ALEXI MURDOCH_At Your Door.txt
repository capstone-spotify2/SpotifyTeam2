Well, you can hide behind your door
And you can leave me kneeling on the floor
But I will only love you more
Yes I will only love you more

Well, you can take from me all you think you need
And you can bury it deep, deep in the ground
But I will never let you down
No I will never let you down
No I will never let you down
No I will never let you down
