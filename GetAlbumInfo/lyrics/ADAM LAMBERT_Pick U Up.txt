Jumpin' out the window
Movin' on, groovin' on
Which way will the wind blow?
We can't be wrong, so say "So long"
Imma pick you up, Imma pick you up
Whatcha tryin' to say to me?
Catch the train at 2, what you try'na do?
Are you gonna play with me?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, Imma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

Breaking through the boundaries
Rollin' on, strollin' on
They won't ever find me
After all, we'll have a ball
Imma pick you up, Imma pick u up
We're gonna see where we can go
This is how I live, this is what I give
And you're the one I want to know

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, Imma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

Tiny minded two-toned suckers
Same old faces make me shudder
Countless times I've screamed oh brother! 
Where are you? I need someone to be my lover... ! 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip, Imma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?

It's a trip, Imma flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean... ?
