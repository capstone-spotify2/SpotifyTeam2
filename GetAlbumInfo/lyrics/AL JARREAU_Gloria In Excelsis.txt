O blessed town 
Of Bethlehem
Within thy gray 
Green shade
Ringed round 
With 
Terraced vineyard
And depth 
Of olive glade
There on thy high 
Green pastures
The shepherds 
Watch their sheep
The low large moon 
Shines glim'ring
O'er all 
The upland steep

What music 
Of the heavens
What magic song 
Of bliss 
What vision 
Of the night-tide
What mystic light 
Is this?
The silly sheep 
Are blinded
The shepherds 
In amaze
Stand awe-struck 
All the hillside
With glory 
Is abaze

The angels' 
Joyous 

Rings out 
Into the night
O Gloria 
In excelsis
Sing praises 
In the height
Sing praises 
Men of Bethlehem

Sing praises 
Here below
For peace 
On Earth 
And goodwill
He doth 
On your bestow

For on this day 
Is born there
Within 
Your little town
A Child 
Who Christ 
The Lord is
Yet wears 
No earthly crown
He bringeth joy 
And gladness
To you 
And all mankind
Yea 
Peace on earth 
And good-will
To men 
Of equal mind

O blessed town 
Of Bethlehem
How happy 
Is thy state
How blest 
Above all palaces
The stable 
At thy gate
For there 
In manger-cradle
(Oh true the angel word)
As King enthroned 
Of all the worlds
Reigns Jesus Christ 
The Lord
