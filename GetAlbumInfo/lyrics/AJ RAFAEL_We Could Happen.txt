I'll hold the door
Please come in
And just sit here for a while.
This is my
Way of telling you I need you in my life.

It's so cold
Without your touch.
I've been dreaming way too much
Can we just
Turn this into reality.

Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately.
Maybe you could save me,
From this crazy world we live in.
And I know we could happen,
Cause you know that I've been feeling you.

Storms they will come
But I know,
That the sun will shine again.
He's my friend,
And he says that we belong together.
I'll sing a song,
To break the ice.
Just a smile from you would suffice.
It's not me,
Being nice girl this is real tonight.

Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately.
Maybe you could save me,
From this crazy world we live in.
And I know we could happen,
Cause you know that I've been feeling you.
I know you want me.

There's no other,
There's no other love.
That I'd rather have,
You know.
There ain't no one,
There ain't no one else.
I want you for myself.

Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately.
Maybe you could save me,
From this crazy world we live in.
And I know we could happen,
Cause you know that I've been feeling you.
I know you want me too.

Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately.
Maybe you could save me,
From this crazy world we live in.
And I know we could happen,
Cause you know that I've been feeling you.
I know you want me too.
