I was afraid to spell
And I know that you were too
If we try there is nothing to loose right now
There's just me and you

I've never felt this way
I love you, I love you
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way

I've never felt this way
I love you, I love you
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way

(Put your lips like this) <i>[echo]</i>
(Like this) <i>[echo]</i>

I was afraid to spell
And I know that you were too
If we try there is nothing to loose right now
There's just me and you

I always remember, I can not believe
But my baby, you show me
You show me that it's real

I've never felt this way
I love you, I love you
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way

I've never felt this way
I love you, I love you
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way

I thought you were just for a night
But you seemed to be much more
I felt something inside my heart
What your eyes could show

I always remember, I can not believe
But my baby, you show me
You show me that it's real

I've never felt this way
I love you, I love you
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way

I've never felt this way
I've never felt this way
Baby you, you show me the way
