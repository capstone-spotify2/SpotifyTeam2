It's the way we feel
Tonight
As if it's all unreal
All right
My love, won't you come back to
Our love, you know I'll react to
The blood that moves my body
Now covers the ground
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body

There's nowhere to go
Tonight
Lend some warmth to our cold
And lonely lives
Red stains on 'Eyes Of A Blue Dog'
My pains fade as the interiors fog
The blood that moves my body 
Now colours the ground
The blood that moves the body
The blood that moves the body

Not long ago
It hurt us so
A tremble through our lives
The love and care...
The way we were 
Lost its way at nights

It's the way we feel
Tonight
Lend some warmth to our cold
And lonely lives
My love, won't you come back to
Our love, you know we'll react to
The blood that moved our bodies
Now covers the ground...
Now covers the ground
