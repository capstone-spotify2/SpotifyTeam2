Sometimes all you need is someone to hold you
Sometimes that's all you're looking for
But I'd like to take the time to get to know you
'Cause I don't want this time to be like all the times before.

I want to know you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into those eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make love.

I've learned from all those lonely nights with strangers
It takes time for real love to be found
I feel the invitation of your body
But I'd like to look inside your soul before I lay you down.

I want to know you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into those eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make love.

If we take it slow together, together
We might make it last forever.

I want to know you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into those eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make love.

I want to know you before we make,
Before we make, love...
