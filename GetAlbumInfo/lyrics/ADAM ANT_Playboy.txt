What do you wear in bed?
Some headphones on my head
What do you like to hold?
My breath, she said.
(He's a playboy)
Hi there, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Was it in my dreams, I'm not too sure
The way you look seems so unfair
All that beauty, golden hair.
You dance like someone heaven blessed
All wrapped up in gorgeous dress
I just want you to catch me when I fall...
Has anyone ever told you you've got the most
Beautiful eyes?
I really do mean it.
D'you like fast cars?...
She like Johnny, she likes Joe
But they both ignore her so
Mister Playboy sing your song
And the horse you rode in on...
