You just found heaven,
It's safe to say you'll do it again.

It's been a while since you needed a shoulder to cry on,
Now you're coming to me for a helping hand,
You're out all night fooling around,
It just ain't right the way you're letting her down,
It's the same old story time after time.

Take a look at your life, 
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just can't get it right,
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.

How can you turn your back on the girl you rely on,
Then you leave it to me to try and turn it around,
Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help you understand,
It's the same old story time after time.

Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again (you know you'll do it again),
You just cant get it right (oh no you cant),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.

I can't believe you did it again,
Your only breaking your heart like this,
Till it's tearing you apart and then,
You're right back where you started. 

Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help u understand,
It's the same old story time after time,
Oh baby.

Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just cant get it right (oh no no no),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
