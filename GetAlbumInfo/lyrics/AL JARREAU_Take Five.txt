Just stop and take a little time out with me.
Oh just take five, just take five.
Stop your busy day and take the time out to see
that I'm alive, I'm alive.

Oh, though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
not a single word do we say
It's a pantomine, I'm out of time.
Still I know our eyes often meet,
I feel tingles down to my feet,
When you smile, that's much too discreet.
Sends me on my way.

Now wouldn't it be better not to be so polite
when you could offer a light?
Just start a little conversation now, it's alright
when you're taking five...(ah-ha)

Five!

Won't ya take a little time out with me (my pretty)
Baby take five.
Stop your busy day and take the time to see, girl, that I'm alive
Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomine, I'm out of time
Still I know our eyes often meet,
I feel tingles down to my feet,
When you smile, that's much too discreet.
Sends me on my way.

Wouldn't it be better not to be so polite, pretty mama
Don't you know that you could offer me a light?
Start a little conversation now, it's alright
when you're taking five...

Won't ya take a little time out with me, girl
Come take five
Stop your busy day and take the time to see that I'm alive
Oh, though I'm going out of my way
so I can pass by each day
not a single word do we say
It's a pantomine, I'm out of time
Still I know our eyes often meet,
I feel tingles down to my feet,
When you smile, that's much too discreet.
Sends me on my way.

Baby,just don't say hello and do not stare
you could offer your hand
hugging and a-chugging it could be so grand
oh take fiiive
