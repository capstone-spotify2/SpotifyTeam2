The night is good when you feel like a child
And when people tell us we need to straighten out
I'm gonna walk right across this town
Yelling your name and I'll wait for you to come on down
Have you had yourself a good time for a while lately now
I just can't understand what you're so worried about

You're goin' to the party by the end of tonight
There's gonna be dancing and there's gonna be a fight

Guess who's gonna be there for you
When you're too drunk to know what the heck ya doin'
I'm right here to carry you on home
And it won't be long
Gotta take me home now, I know you ain't drinking water
You gotta take me back cause
I'm still somebody's daughter, alright

You're goin' to the party by the end of tonight
There's gonna be dancing and there's gonna be a fight
