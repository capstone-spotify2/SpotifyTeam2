How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker
I didn't know, I couldn't know
Now I'm laying on this killing floor and I wanna die
Listen
How I was supposed to know,
Was it by your sweet face or your eyes
Oh lord
How was I supposed to know you gimme my heart aching
Mama couldn't tell me about the feeling
And all them love sick songs... well
They got true meaning
Oh why, why did you have to slice me wide babe
How was I supposed to know you gimme my first heart aching

How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker
Oh I didn't know, I didn't know
Now I'm on this killing floor and I wanna die

Who ever said that we two were never meant
I'll tell you how I know you're wrong, I'd fight you all
I know the way things are, I'd fight the planets

Why, why did you have to slice so wide baby
How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker

Oh, how was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker
Oh, oh, I didn't know, I didn't know
Why you gotta go and kill me so that I wanna die
Oh "I wanted to grow old with you'" you told me so
But then you go
How was I supposed to know
