Time don't break me,
Don't throw my heart into the storm
See, I am hearing
Trying to live up on my star, just glow
The winds might be blowing, 
and leaves could be falling silently
I choose to be blind,
Not see that I'm deep in that sea
I'm keeping the light, and these crystals 
And make sure the dark they hear
So don't you worry, so don't you worry

Just some light, give me some light (let go)
Stay by my side (let go)
By my side (let go)
Just some light, give me some light (let go)
Stay by my side (let go)
By my side (let go)
(By my, by my side)

Time don't break me,
Don't throw my heart into the storm
See, I am hearing
Trying to live up on my star, just glow
The winds might be blowing, 
and leaves could be falling silently
I choose to be blind,
Not see that I'm deep in that sea
I'm keeping the light, and these crystals 
And make sure the dark they hear
So don't you worry, so don't you worry

Just some light, give me some light (let go)
Stay by my side (let go)
By my side (let go)
Just some light, give me some light (let go)
Stay by my side (let go)
By my side (let go)
(By my, by my side)

See the light it comes brighter, brighter
And then you see the light in you, you are stronger
Oh baby really are

You &amp; me, (let go)
Stay you &amp; me (let go)
Stay, stay by my side (let go)
Stay, you &amp; me (let go)
Stay, you &amp; me (let go)
Let go!
