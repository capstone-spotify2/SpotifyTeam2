I'll be there watching from way up high
The shadow you can't see when the suns in the sky
Wondering eyes have no disguise
It's obvious that this love never dies
Never dies...

I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see <i>[x2]</i>
I'll be your guardian angel (guardian angel)
Guardian angel (guardian angel) <i>[x2]</i>
Watching over you (watching over you)

When you thought that you were alone,
You turned your back on me.
It's cause you think you sit high on a throne
I'll always have you on your knees.

I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see
I'll be your guardian angel, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
Your sweet company, (I can't get them off, get them off of you)
No matter where I go, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
I'll make sure you're all I see (I can't get them off of you)

I pray you'll be watching from way up high,
The shadow I can't see when the sun's in the sky (watching over you)

She felt a sense of fear as I came near,
And on my face, I drew a tear.
(She felt a sense of fear)

I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see
I'll be your guardian angel, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
Your sweet company, (I can't get them off, get them off of you)
No matter where I go, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
I'll make sure you're all I see (I can't get them off of you)

I'll be there watching from way up high
The shadow you can't see when the suns in the sky
