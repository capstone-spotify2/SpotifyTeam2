So here we are
Follow the rabbit hole down
We will find out
How far down it goes
So do you want to know?
Where we are living in?
In shadows
Are we just animals?
Or something disguised as?

The innocent are fast asleep
A phantom juggernaut in dreams
Have we just lost it?
Have we just lost it?
The idiots are fast asleep
An empire falls beneath our feet
Are we just lost?

So here we are
I'm seeing you out of focus
We will swan dive
Into the abyss
