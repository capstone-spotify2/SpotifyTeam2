It's do or die.
Gotta go put in, overtime.
Yea, cause it's now or never.

I'm a put it on the line,
Gotta win so I'm ganna grind.
Put it overtime <i>[x5]</i>

Cause I got money on my mind,
Give me every penny, every dime.
Put it overtime <i>[x5]</i>
Cause it's now or never.
Put it over time.

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
Well I'm sitting on the goal line.
Staring at the game clock.
Facing a hundred years,
Member Jordan had the same shot
Carolina blue,
California green.
Jump for the white,
Getcho frilly sheets.
Ace Hood they go crazy when I'm in your city.
Ace Hood, that's what they sayin in every city.
I put my team first,
We never reheard.
We the best franchise cause it's chids first.
Start the life where I give to the G-co,
Drafted outa high school then I hit my free throws.
You see them free shows, we call them free throws
Now it cost em 20 stacks just to witness me flow
Just to witness me flow

It's do or die,
Gotta go put it overtime.
Cause it's now or never,
I'm a put it on the line,
I gotta win so I'm a grind
Put it overtime <i>[x5]</i>

Cause I got money on my mind,
Give me every penny, every dime.
Put it overtime <i>[x5]</i>
Cause it's now or never.
Put it over time.

Diamond rings,
Real niggers do real things.
I say hanging with the bitches and the songs I sing.
Real niggers do real things.
I'm listening in the back

If your tryna win the trophy then u gotta do it big.
We own every bag,
And I keep it fly.
We don't needa see the tag,
We just see if there's a cop
Pulling out of control,
Puttin out on the line.
Oh mumma sippin for calfornia I want it triple time.
Now get down onto your seats,
I'm about to double time.
Ace Hood, Konvict we gonna put in overtime.

It's do or die,
Gotta go put it overtime.
Cause it's now or never,
I'm a put it on the line,
I gotta win so I'm a bribe
Put it overtime <i>[x5]</i>

I'm a put it on the line,

<i>[T-Pain:]</i>

And I can't slow down for nothing.
See I, gotta get overtime,
Cauz I'm a stay on my grind
Cauz money stays on my mind
I feel like 24 hours just ain't enough for me,
If you feel me put your hands up for me.
This is over grind,

Because I'm putting overtime.

Cause I got money on my mind,
Give me every penny, every dime.
