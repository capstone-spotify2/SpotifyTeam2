I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
Iâm searching for a song tonight
Iâm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So Iâm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
But something strange has come over me
And now I canât get over you
No, I just canât get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So Iâm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So Iâm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to
Following, following, following
