The story starts laying in the dark with someone new
Iâm feeling tired from all the time I spent on you
But I know Iâm strong from all the trouble Iâve been through
The story starts where the story falls apart with you

Donât lie, bright eyes
Is it me that you see when you fall asleep?
Cause I know itâs you I dream about every night
Giving me a feeling like
Love in the summer
Way Iâve never felt with another
Donât lie, bright eyes
Is it me that you see?
Tell me Iâm not dreaming alone

The story starts lying in the dark broken and bruised
I count the scars left in my heart from losing you
And I was wrong but letâs be honest you were too
I miss the part where I was falling hard for you 

So donât lie, bright eyes
Is it me that you see when you fall asleep?
Cause I know itâs you I dream about every night
Giving me this feeling like
Love in the summer
Way Iâve never felt with another
Donât lie, bright eyes
Is it me that you see?
Tell me Iâm not dreaming alone

I canât take back the things I said
And I wonât say that I regret
Any day that I was yours

Donât lie, bright eyes
I know itâs me that you see when you fall asleep
And you know itâs you I dream about every night
Giving me this feeling like
Love in the summer
Way Iâve never felt with any other 
Donât lie, bright eyes
Itâll always be you and me, so why are we dreaming alone?
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
Itâll always be you and me, so why are we dreaming alone?
