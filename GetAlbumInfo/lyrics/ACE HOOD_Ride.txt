Chea 
Ace Hood 
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me 
I want you to be my ride or die 
While I go get this money, I promise im get us out the hood baby 

<i>[Chorus - Trey Songz]</i>
Even though im in the streets 
You know exactly what I do 
When I chase this paper 
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you 
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good 
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood 

<i>[Ace Hood]</i>
Listen 
Baby look, just ride with me 
Swear that I got us mama 
One thing I love about it 
See you aint wit that drama 
You be my ride or die like bonnie imma play the clyde 
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house 
That's why you never trip im grindin bump a 9-5 
Gotta get this money, paper callin but you never whine 
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes 
That's why I suprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind 
Cuz when im gone lil mama home alone at every time 
You never blowed my phone up yet cuz you respect the grind 
And you never holla bout a problem keep it on the line

<i>[Chorus - Trey Songz]</i>

<i>[Trey Songz]</i>
Now what's the definition of a rider 
Through it all they gon stand right beside ya 
If you got one look em in the eyes 
Tell em you gon ride 
Tell em you gon ride (ri ri ri ri ri ride) 
Till the wheel fall off or the day that I die 
That's on my life aint nun wrong wit tryna love somebody

<i>[Ace Hood]</i>
Ace, and I promise this to you 
Imma get us out this hood 
Into them places that you thinkin that you never could 
But you gotta ride like them tires on the mini coop 
Imma get this cash paper bags and give half to you 
Forget them haters 
Keep you tailored see whats sexy too 
And I like your body all I think about is doin you 
And I love the money so I guess it's like doin two 
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot 

<i>[Chorus - Trey Songz]</i>
Even though im in the streets 
You know exactly what I do 
When I chase this paper 
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you 
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good 
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood 

Yea yea yea
