This Is Where I've Got To Draw The Line
Cause I Refuse To Let You Think You Can Play With My Mind
Always Seems That You Think That I'm Blind
Causes There Always Certain Times When Your Hard To Find
Your On The Go, I'm On The Go, Were On The Go
I Can't Catch You No More, Can't See You No More
And It No Longer Can Be Ignored
Cause At Once Upon A Time It Was You I Adored
You Disappeared And Left Me Here, Out In The Cold 
And The Absence Of You Is Hurting My Soul
Didn't Know There Was An End Of The Road
It Was So Easy For You Just To Let It All Go

And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door

And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No Way , But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore

Remember When I Told You I Could Feel The Change
You Don't Touch Me The Same, Don't Hold Me The Same
No, I Don't Want You To Take All The Blame
Cause I Know I Had Those Moments When I Caused The Pain
This Back And Forth Just Like A War With You And Me
See We Both Disagree, Have We Ever Agreed?
This Is Nothing Like I Thought It Would Be
Was It All Just A Dream? Was It Ever In My Reach?

And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door

It Was Your Way
Or It Was No Way
And I Couldn't Live That Way
It Was Our Call
Then It Was Your Call
Cause I Gave You My All And All

And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door

No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore

No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore

I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (I Refuse)
And I Refuse (Ooooh)

And I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (Said I Refuse)
And I Refuse
Said I Refuse To Take It Anymore
