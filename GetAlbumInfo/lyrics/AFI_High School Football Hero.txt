I wanna be a highschool football hero.
With an S.A.T. score less than zero. I wanna
try to drink my weight in beer-o. I wanna be a highschool football hero.
I wanna score a touchdown so I can score after the game.
I don't care about my future 'cause it is just another day.
I'll rush for forty yards and drink four forties later on. I'm done with
this brunette someone pass me another blonde.
Coach tells me to drink my milk and wash it down with 'roids.
I've gotta get my rest so I can
party with the boys.
My brain is upside-down, so I'm just a little slow.
I'll change my name to
Bubba so that everyone will know...
