Don't you ever let this world push you around
Use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
If you get knocked down get back up and try again

Don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
Don't bottle up your passion like a jar of fireflies
If you ever lose sight of your light and you feel like givin' in

Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your Mom and Daddy's love
When you fear when you fail when you feel your gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

Don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
Go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
Love is a virtue, honesty is the key, say your prayers, brush your teeth
And don't you watch too much TV

If you're down in the count, one strike away
Choke up and crowd the plate and put the ball in play
Keep your nose down when you win and keep your head up when you lose
And you're gonna lose

Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your Mom and Daddy's love
When you fear when you fail when you feel your gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

And there will come a day when I will fly away
So make me smile while we're apart
You gotta sing from your soul and play with all of your heart

There's a good chance your heart will break in two
Trust that God has someone special planned for you
Did you know I was down on love and luck when he sent your mom to me

Someday you'll have babies of your own
So cherish every moment you're gonna blink and they'll be grown
The greatest honor that I've ever had is having you call me your dad

Boys don't forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
When you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
