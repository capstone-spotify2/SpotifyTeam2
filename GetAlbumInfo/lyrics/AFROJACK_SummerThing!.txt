I don't wanna write this love song
I, I'm fighting this urge
What you make me say uh uh uh uh uh
Damn! 'Cause I, I can't find the words
I don't wanna write this love song
Just wanna dance all night till it hurts
But you make me say uh uh uh uh uh
Damn! 'Cause I, I can't find the words!

Uh, you stole my heart we had a summerfling
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing!

But you made me fall in the winter,
Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December
It was you and me!
And I told my heart it was just a summefling,
That it was just a summerthing!

This, this ain't no love song, it's just a little game baby
I just wanna go uh uh uh uh uh
'Cause you, you're so pretty baby!
This, this ain't no love song, just wanna watch you dance sexy baby
I just wanna go uh uh uh uh uh
Damn, now safe it if you let me baby!

You stole my heart, we had a summerfling!
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing!

But you made me fall in the winter,
Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December
It was you and me!
And I told my heart it was just a summerfling,
That it was just a summerthing!

I will always remember the summer, the summerthing
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing!
I will always remember the summer, the summerthing
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing!

You stole my heart, we had a summerfling!
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing!

But you made me fall in the winter,
Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December
It was you and me!
And I told my heart it was just a summerfling,
That it was a summerthing!
