You got this subtle kind of way of making everything turn grey
Like a bottle that runs dry before youâve even had a drink
Do you think what you do just might fix the bad in you?
Well, youâre wrong this time around

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, Iâm gonna survive with my head held high
And finally walk away
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to be the one thatâs not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship âcause Iâm done
Waiting to be saved

You got this subtle kind of way about you that pulls me under but I wonât drown
Itâs gonna take a whole lot more than that to ever bring me down
I promise that Iâll be back and Iâll be better than before
What you broke down Iâll build back up, âcause I donât need you anymore

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines
And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, Iâm gonna survive with my head held high
And finally walk away
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to be the one thatâs not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship âcause Iâm done
Waiting to be saved

Do you think what you do just might fix the bad in you?
Well, youâre wrong this time around

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, Iâm gonna survive with my head held high
And finally walk away
Iâm gonna be a comeback kid
And I want to be the one thatâs not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship âcause Iâm done
Waiting to be saved
