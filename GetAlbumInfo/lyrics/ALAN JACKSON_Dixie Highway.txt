I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

Wood frame house and gravel driveway
Willow trees and old front porch
Just outside the city limits, on the highway 34.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

And having tobacco growing on the roadside
Rolled it up and we smoked it down.
Donât do much, but it makes you feel big
When youâre ten years old in a tiny town.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

Have a chicken pen right in the backyard
Clothes line running east to west
Butter bean and Tomato garden, six days and a Sunday rest.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

Summertime, hot and hazy, bare feet and a water hose
Melon rind on a country table
Lightning bugs when the sun goes down.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

And the holy ghost on a Sunday morning,
Gospel songs and a Bible read
Sunday lunch at mommaâs table, thank the Lord and break the bread.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

Screened in porch right at the backdoor,
Washing machine and an old wood stove
Mommaâs singing in the kitchen, rolling homemade biscuit dough.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.

When Iâm old and Heavenâs calling
And they come to carry me away
Just lay me down, down in south land
Bury me in the Georgia clay.

I was born on the Dixie Highway, red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place youâll ever find.
