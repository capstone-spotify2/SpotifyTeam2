If I could have you 
I know what I'd do
This time I'd be true
If I had you

If you could be mine
I'd walk that straight line
There'd be no bad times 
If I had you

I make the worst mistake
One fool could ever make
Tell me it's not to late
What can I do

If I could hold you tight
I'd have the world tonight
Everything would be alright
If I had you

I make the worst mistake
One fool could ever make
Tell me it's not to late
What can I do

If I could hold you tight
I'd have the world tonight
Everything would be alright
If I had you
Everything would be alright
If I had you
