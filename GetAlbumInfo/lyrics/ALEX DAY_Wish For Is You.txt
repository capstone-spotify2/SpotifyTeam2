I'm a wisher, a dreamer, my future's unwritten. 
I am hopeful to know what I want will come true.
I'm not foolish. I don't think things come to me out of the blue.
And then I met you.

Now I put my pennies aside for you.
Wish bones one on behalf of you.
Eyelash dust on the wind to me now.
Faithful when you're not around.
I'll give you everything you ever wished for.
Everything I'd ever wish for is you.

On my birthday, the candles burn down to the icing.
If a genie came to me, I'd just set him loose.
I'm not wasting, my dreaming, for nothing my mind can produce.
Is better than you.

So, I put my pennies aside for you.
Wish bones one on behalf of you.
Eyelash dust on the wind to me now.
Faithful when you're not around.
I'll give you everything you ever wished for.
Everything I'd ever wish for is you.

If you need anything, you know I'm only a wish away.

I'm a wisher, a dreamer, my future's unwritten.

And then I met you.

So, I put my pennies aside for you.
Wish bones one on behalf of you.
Eyelash dust on the wind to me now.
Faithful when you're not around.
