The time has come, You're really leavin'
You always told me that you wanted to
I guess I never thought It would happen
I guess I never really wanted it to
The world is calling you and you must answer
But you can take me with you In your dreams

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waitin' for you

Your sister told me you were workin'
At some office out in tinsel town
Don't forget about those who love you
They'll be there for you if you get down
I believe in you and all you're after
I hope you end up where you want to be

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waitin' for you

Thirty years now have gone by quickly
I still think of you from time to time
My wife died early, I've got children
I'm happy and my health is fine
I often wondered if you found your freedom
I sometimes wonder if I should have gone

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waitin' for you.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waitin' for you

I'll be waiting for you.
I'll be waiting for you.!...
