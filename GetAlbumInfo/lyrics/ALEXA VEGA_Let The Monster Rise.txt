<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Didn't I tell you not to go out?
Didn't I... ?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
You did... 
You did... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Didn't I say the world was cruel?
Didn't I... ?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
You did... 
You did... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Then tell me how this happened
What I did wrong?
Tell me, why?
Can we just go home, Shi?
And forget this dreadful night?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Didn't you say that you were different?
Didn't you... ?

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
I am... 
I am... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Say you aren't that person, 
Say it... 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
I am... 
I am... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Then tell me how to act, Dad
What to say, Dad?
Tell me, why?
All you've ever told me, 
Every word is a lie! 

Didn't you say that you'd protect me?
Didn't you! 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
I tried... 
I tried... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Is that how you'd help me?
Is it! 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
I tried! 
I tried! 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Don't help me anymore, Dad
You are dead, Dad, 
In my eyes! 

Someone has replaced you.
Dad, I hate you! 
Go and die! 

<i>[Anthony Head:]</i>
Didn't I build a house? A home?
Didn't I! 

(You did... You did...)

Didn't I raise her all alone?
Didn't I! 

(You did... You did...)

Then Rotti took her from me! 
Stole my Shilo! 
He's to blame! 
Have I failed my daughter?
Then let the father die! 
And let the monster rise!
