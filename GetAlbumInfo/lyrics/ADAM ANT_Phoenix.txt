I said hello, hello, hello, hello, hello you
She said hello, hello, hello, hello, hello me
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
You know these arms of yours are gonna heal me
Next to you baby, pretty baby, gonna be all right 

Our love, our love
Is like a butterfly, is like a dove
Next to you baby, pretty baby, gonna be all right 
Our love, our love, ooh yeah 

Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes, yeah 

Our love, our love
Is like a butterfly, is like a dove
So stupid oh maybe, pretty baby, gonna be all right 

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello you
She said hello, hello, hello, hello, hello me
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
You know these arms of yours are gonna heal me
When I'm next to you baby, pretty baby, gonna be all right 

Our love, our love
Is like a butterfly, is like a dove
So <i>[?]</i>, pretty baby, gonna be all right 
Our love, our love, ooh yeah 

Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes, yeah 

So different now, it's a whole new scene
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen
In a <i>[?]</i> in a corridor
When you get too hot, roll on to the floor

All different now, a whole new way
When she takes my hand, she takes my breath away
Exhausted bliss with him a vow
If you gotta go, don't do it now
Don't do it now, don't do it now
Don't do it now, don't do it now
Don't do it now, don't do it now

Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Our love is like a Phoenix
Rising from the ashes
