I read your veins like lines on a map
But I got no destination
See the smoke and the signals rise from my breath
And the flames are cold and patient
I filled you with a wonderland
Born of my imagination and
Go I can't

Cause my demons tied me down
With silk chains wrapped around
My soul it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like toxins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
Oh no
They're just demons

I'm pushing through the blood in you
To heal where you've been hurting
And I'm so numb I don't feel it run
When it stains the walls around me
I filled the room with shades of you
Drawn in my imagination and
Go I can't

Cause my demons tied me down
With silk chains wrapped around
My soul it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like toxins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
Oh no
They're just demons
They're just demons

They're just demons
 They're just demons

Staring up the road
Sick of the darkness and the cold
The chains are wearing thin
Oh I'm fighting for us both
I built this wonderland
Drenched in the colors of your skin and
Go I can

Cause my demons tied me down
But silk chains are broken now
I know it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like toxins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious
That I should put an end to this
Oh no
They're just demons
They're just demons
