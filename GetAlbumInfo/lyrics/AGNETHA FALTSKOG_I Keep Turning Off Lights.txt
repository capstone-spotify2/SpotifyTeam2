Staring into space, I try to convince myself
It doesn't really matter that I'm living your life not mine,
Then holding my head up high
I swallow hard and ask myself why,
How is it I find myself here with you?

I keep turning off lights,
And getting under covers
Caught up in your nights,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights,
Rolling with the thunder
Fighting for my life,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights.

What is this need I have for giving too much?
Then I feel guilt for never ever taking enough,
I keep making the same mistakes
How much more do I have to take?
I'd rather die than have to face the night.

I keep turning off lights,
And getting under covers
Caught up in your nights,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights,
Rolling with the thunder
Fighting for my life,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights.

I can't hide, I can't run
I don't know who I'm really running from,
I guess I know I'm trying to avoid myself
I keep turning off lights.

I keep turning off lights,
And getting under covers
Caught up in your nights,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights,
Rolling with the thunder
Fighting for my life,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights.

I keep turning off lights,
And getting under covers
Caught up in your nights,
Crying for the answers
Oh, I keep turning off lights,
Rolling with the thunder
Fighting for my life....
