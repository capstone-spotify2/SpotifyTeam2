I held the keys to that Chevrolet 
and you held the keys to my heart
I'd throw a fit, hit the dash,
get out and kick the tire
when that old piece of junk wouldn't start
It'd be smoking good I'm slam down the hood
Just to see you laughing at me
On the other side of a dirty windshield,
lookin' as pretty as could be

We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17

In the blink of an eye high school flew by
you went your way and I went mine
But we swore we'd make it,
our love could take it
400 miles could stand the test of time

Well I left that fall to play college ball,
but my dreams would all come to an end
'Cause you know the big leagues never called,
and you went and fell in love with him

We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17

Memories flash through my mind like old faded photographs
I still think about you in that red Malibu
and I just can't help but laugh

We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17

Love broke down around 3rd gear and 17
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
