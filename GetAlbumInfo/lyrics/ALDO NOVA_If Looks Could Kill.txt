If looks could kill
Girl now don't you know that you're dead and gone
Since I laid eyes on you, I knew you were the one
You kept me up all night, and you never left me down
I thought that I was tough, until you knocked me to the ground, yeah

You got a hold, you got a hold on me
You stole my heart and then she set me free
Little passion in the first degree
So look out!

You better watch out
(You better look out for her)
Cause it looks, cause I like you, yeah
You better watch out for her
Cause looks could kill

Well if looks could kill
Don't you know that I could laugh without defense
Cause by the way you move
I know that it ain't your first defense

You got a hold, you got a hold on me
She took my heart and then she set me free
Little passion in the first degree
So look out!

You better watch out
(You better look out for her)
Cause it looks, cause I like you, yeah
You better watch out for her
Cause looks could kill baby, come on!

Oh! If looks could kill
Oh! If looks could kill

You better look out!
(You better look out for her)
(You better) Because your looks could kill
You better watch out for her
(You better)
(Oh! If looks could kill)

You better watch out!
(You better look out for her)
Yeah, yeah! Oh! Nah nah nah nah nah!
You better watch out for 
You better! Oh oh, you better watch out!
(You better look out for her)
(You better watch out for her)
