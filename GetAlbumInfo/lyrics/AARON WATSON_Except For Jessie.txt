Well before she came along he was lonesome onry and mean
It was his way or the high way
But she had a way that he'd never seen
He'd been livin hard and fast
All his takin was takin its toll
And it took a good hearted, hard headed angel
To help him gain control

He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one

Except for Jessie

Well she never tried to change him
But she loved him and gave him a son
And that ain't easy with a honky tonkin man
Makin music on the run
And Lord knows she was a good wife
Always good at findin ways to right his wrongs
She was the love of his life, the inspiration for his songs

He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Except for Jessie

He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Except for Jessie
