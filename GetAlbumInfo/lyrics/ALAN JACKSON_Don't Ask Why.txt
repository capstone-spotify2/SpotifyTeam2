Ask me any kind of question
Anything you wanna know
Tell you all about my lovers
Heartaches and laughter
From a long time ago

Ask me if I'm finally happy
I've never really been before
Ever since you happened to me
I've told all my secrets
I don't have anymore

Ask me now
And I won't tell a lie
Ask me how
I've been feelin' inside
When somebody loves you
You know that it's true
Don't ask why

And ask me if I really mean it
When I tell you I love you
Ask me will I please repeat it
I'll tell you forever if you want me to

And ask me now
And I won't tell a lie
Ask me how
I've been feelin' inside
When somebody loves you
And you know that it's true
Don't ask why
Now don't ask why
