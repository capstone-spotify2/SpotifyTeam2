Creator as Observer congruent systems collapsing mutating waveforms to become sight sound touch.
A sick perception is now my only link to reality sorched eternally blistering yet I prevail.
My merciless plan of creation etails seeing the unseen forge an abomination to annihilate with a cold hearted sense of compassion devastation.
Thy vicious modus operandi.
Observer as Creator beguiling unstable electric forms.
These tools of judgment they thirst for unpure.
Draining a carcass devour the contaminate and filth that roamst amongst us sterilizing out human forms.
Shredding tissue fracturing bone.
Burning synapse rewiring conscious.
A brutal reforming of features a hideous cleansing of God.
Self Purification achieved when whats left is devoid of deformations.
