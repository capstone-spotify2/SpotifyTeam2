Johnny come lately on a Saturday night 
Singin' how de do 
Backstreet a boogie in the house of delight 
Where they steal the show 
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet 
It's a love affair 
Whole place rockin', people stompin' their feet 
A when the gang's all there 

He gets his woman every night for free 
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe 
I sing na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na

Johnny like to gamble with his lady Louise 
She was a black jack deuces are wild 
He got to thinking 'bout his nose in the breeze 
Put it there, Johnny looked and he smiled 
He started thinking 'bout the fortune and fame 
With the young girls down at his knees 
He dug the money but forgot all the names 
So he knew just how to appease 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Lick and a promise 
Lick and a promise 
Lick and a promise 
He gave the ladies a 
Lick and a promise

Lick and a promise
He gave the ladies a
Lick and a promise 

Loose change grubber in his early, early years 
Had his poor mama pacin' the floors 
He grabbed a guitar and a couple a beers 
Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more 

He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe

I sing na, na, na, na, na
Sing na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
