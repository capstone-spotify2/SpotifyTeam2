Well hello matey
What have you done for me lately?
Yeah
Are you paying my rent?
Are you my best friend?
You cant beat our meat
So you better shut your pipehole
Mister, are you listening
To the bingy bingy bingy bingy bongy children?
Do you feel good?
Do you feel the shame?
Or is it 1969 Again?
Oh how you make me
Wish I was a baby
Yeah
When you're playing Miss Swish
Knickers on we're british
You're my agony nanny
With you big towel protection
Mister, are you listening
To the bingy bingy bingy bingy bongy children?
Do you feel good?
Do you feel the shame?
Coz it's 1969 Again
God made the little fishes
And god he made the seven seas
God makes us to pay for our sins
That's why he gave us
The bingly bongly children
1969 Again...
Mister, are you listening
To the bingy bingy bingy bingy bongy children?
Do you feel good?
Do you feel the shame?
Coz it's 1969 Again
1969 Again...
