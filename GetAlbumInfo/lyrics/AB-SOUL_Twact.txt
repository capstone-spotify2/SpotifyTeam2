<i>[Intro - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Jinx what up my nigga?
Soulo

I get turnt, I get rowdy
Backwood full of some of the loudest!
I'm fucked up! I get wasted
That's a hundred dollar cup I just wasted!
I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker!

<i>[Verse 1 - Jinx:]</i>
Uh, Twact out till I pass out
If you ain't fucking with the team then you assed outFlow dope like a crack house, bitches pill poppin'
House poppin' like a Frat House
Keep 16s like a verse nigga
Codeine got me leaning in reverse nigga
I popped a Xanny then she dropped her panties
I get the dough and bring it home, to the family
See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me
I'm from the village baby, I'm just tryna win a Grammy
Uh, smoking Backwoods back-to-back
Double cross the squad and get popped like Cracker Jacks
You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped
A real Compton resident, yeah you know I'm that
I pulled up to the function with the pack
Turnt in this bitch to the max!

<i>[Hook - Doeburger &amp; Jinx:]</i>
My nigga I'm twact (I get high)
Turkey bag full of that gas
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
Styrofoam cups, no glass
Nigga I'm twact (get high)
Got them bars on me, no rap
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
I don't even know where I'm at
Nigga I'm Twact!

<i>[Verse 2 - Short Dawg:]</i>
I just got home boy I'm glad I made it
The Codeine got me activated
New mix alert, Soul you have to taste it
Know I got the lean on me, like tax evasion
I mixed it with a whole lot of cannabis, mind travelling, getting throwed like a javelin
H Town slang I done poured up a Matt Schaub
Drugs got me like woah I'mma twact raw
And now on a mission just to get some cheeks
If she don't answer when I call, Imma hit delete
I don't love these hoes at all, boy I be with freaks
Cause they know if I fall it's gone be asleep
And I'm back on the road sipping mud again
Tryna stay inside the lines like I'm coloring
The cops say "I seen you swerving, tell me why."
I told em I ain't even gon' lie...

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]</i>
Soulo ho, well known from Del-Amo to Soho ho
This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe
I might even set up my camera too
Oh, do the splits on the dick like aerobics
Them other niggas talking shit but they don't know shit
No, they ain't on and ain't on shit
Yeah they on that, I'm on this...
And I don't need no necklace cause I be off the chain
And all they say is yes when everybody know your name
Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes
Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining
Seals in the cut like Navy training, along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming
Eh, Long Hair Don't Care, how come I'm the most faded in here?

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Outro:]</i>
BMB, TDE
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah!
