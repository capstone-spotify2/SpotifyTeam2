Lonely days lonely nights
Without you by my side
Memories and sad songs
Making me feel so blue

<i>[Sara]</i>
Now I know yeah I realize
I see the world with different eyes
Give me one more chance 
And I'll make it all up to you

<i>[All]</i>
So Have a little faith in me
Put a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
So Have a little faith in me
Tonight

Sitting here by the telephone
I try to call but you're not home
I'm drifting away in echoes of yesterday

So have a little faith in me
Put a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight

Have a little faith (yeah yeah yeah)
Put a little trust

So have a little faith in me
Put a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight

Have a little faith (yeah yeah yeah)
And I will hold you in my arms tonight
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight

Have a little faith in me
Tonight
