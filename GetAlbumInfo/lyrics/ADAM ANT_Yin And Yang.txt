I got Utah dust
Inside my boots
Peroxide
Covering my roots
Know what it's like to love
And like to be loved
I tell you it's such a thrilling thing

That's just the Yin and the Yang of it
Sweet China went to dust for the want of it
Call it Zen or call it Buddah
Inner peace or Heavy Banana
That's just the Yin and the Yang of it
Sweet China swam in blood for the need of it
So don't you ask me to stop wanting
Don't ask me to stop needing it
It's just the Yin and the Yang of it

Call it Zen or call it Buddah
Inner peace or Heavy Banana
That's just the Yin and the Yang of it
It's got some words and a beat to it
Don't you ask me to stop wanting it
Don't ask me to stop needing it
It's just the Yin and the Yang of it

Call it Zen or call it Buddah
Inner peace or Heavy Banana
That's just the Yin and the Yang of it

In from the cold
Show me ecstasy
Just let the tears
Roll on out of me
Know what it's like to love
And like to be loved
I tell you it's such a thrilling thing
That's just the Yin and the Yang of it

That's just the Yin and the Yang of it
That's just the Yi-
