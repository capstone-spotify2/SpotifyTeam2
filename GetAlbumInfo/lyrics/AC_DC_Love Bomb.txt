Love bomb love bomber
It's a comin' on strong
I can't take it any longer
Come a rockin' through your door

Cruisin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays, get ready, it's bombs away

Love bomb love bomber
Don't scare no bother
Where the size doesn't matter
Come long, short or badder

Cruisin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays and drop those bombs away

Love bomb comin' on
Love bomb
Love bomb get it hard
