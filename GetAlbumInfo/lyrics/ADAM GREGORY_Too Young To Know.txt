They say we're too young to know
We're too young to fall in love
But all I keep dreaming of
is marrying you

They say we're too young to know
Then how come it hurts inside
And how come I cry at night
when you say we are through
They don't understand a thing
Nothing will change our plans
They say, let it go
'cause we're too young to know

They say we spend too much time together
Too many hours alone
The nights on the telephone
just me and you

They say it's for our own good
That we should stay apart
But what is a broken heart
supposed to do

When tears fall from my eyes
Like rain from the silver skies
Let this heartache go
'cause we're too young to know

And if there's a chance one day
That we could run away
would our love grow
They say we're too young to know
