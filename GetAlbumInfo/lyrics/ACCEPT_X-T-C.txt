I just don't believe
How I keep a runnin'
Women keep me lovin'
Give me all their funnin'

Rock of life seems like a hell of a load
Like a hell of a load

Crazy horse rockin' somehow I belong
Here in the dark of the nihgt
When pushin' comes to showin' you never know
How much a man like me can take

Rock of life seems like a hell of a load
(Rock) - rock of life

You give me just another - (just another)
Just another X-T-C
(Just another) - just another
(Just another) X-T-C

Rats in my cellar somehow I belong here
In the back of the street
Switch blade passion
Why don't you see it for the final scene

(Rock) - rock of life

It gives me just another - (just another)
Just another X-T-C
(Just another) - just another
(Just another) - X-X-T-C, yeah!

Aaah - It gives me just another - (X-T-C)
It gives me just another - (X-T-C)
X-T-C, babe
It gives me just another - (X-T-C)

When you hold on
It gives me just a - just a - just another (X-T-C)
I need - I need - I need - (Your X-T-C)
Need your X-T-C, yeah - when you hold on

When you hold on - (to my X-T-C)
You gotta feel your X-T-C - (X-T-C)

X-T-C,...
