Hey, you know I really liked your show
And hey, I know a place where we could go
And you don't have to do this if it's all you want is love
But hey, I know you really wanna go

How you wanna do this baby?
How you wanna go?
Fill up my emptiness it's you I wanna know
He's just a boy with a nasty seed to sew

There's no more grace to fall from
There's no where left to go but down
