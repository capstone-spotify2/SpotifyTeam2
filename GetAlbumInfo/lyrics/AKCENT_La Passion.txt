I fell in love, I said I do 
I'm setting all my love for you 
Now all I have is memory 
It's theÂ <i>[?]</i> she gave to me. 

<i>[Refrain:]</i>
Tu es toujours comme une ange de l'amour 
Tu est la passion de ma vie. 

'Cause when the darkness dims the light 
Uh, baby it's hard... 
Going lonely through the night... 

<i>[Refrain (x2)]</i>

To turn back time, I'll give my world 
Once again her hand to hold 
It makes no sense if she's gone 
And I have to walk alone... 

'Cause when the darkness dims the light 
Uh, baby it's hard... 
Going lonely through the night... 

<i>[Refrain]</i>

Why did you leave me all alone? 
Oh baby, tell me where'd you go... <i>[x2]</i>
