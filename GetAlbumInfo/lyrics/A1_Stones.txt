I used to be stardust
Then came the big bang
Then I turned to mountain the bed rock the sand
Chiseled and broken
Shaped by a man
Turned into weapon in his hands

Too many stones <i>[3x]</i> have been thrown

A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all
A tip of an arrow
The very first wheel
I held the command and always will

Too many stones <i>[3x]</i> have been thrown

So lay me down, build a path
Walk on me together
Let me be your common ground
And hold on to each other
Lay me down
Lay me down oh
Too many stones have been thrown

Too many stones <i>[3x]</i> have been thrown

Oh lay me down

Too many stones (Lay me down)
Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones have been thrown

Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones (too many stones)
Too many stones have been thrown

A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all
