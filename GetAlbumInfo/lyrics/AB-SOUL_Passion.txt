<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Game keep changing, Tats on faces
Look close, you can see how rats run races
You find it's all about the cheese at the other end
They forgot the simple shit, like strengthening your limbs
I listen to the radio and I begin to cringe
I eat MCs, find a spot inside my fridge
When y'all was tricking off, taking bitches to the bridge
I was sparking up a cig, tryna tighten up this bridge
The hook is real catchy and the verse is interesting
Now all I need is a feature from Drake or Lil Wayne
I never move hoes, like say a Gucci Mane
I'm broke as a bitch, and I spit like I'm insane
But what a nigga gotta do to shock the whole nation
Sign to ROC nation, become a fucking Mason
Monopolize, prophesize an abomination
I'll Do it, but you thought it was just music?

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Passion
What the fuck happened
Somebody talk to him
Motherfuck rapping
(Oooooh, where's your passion)

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
This for my niggas that log on to All HipHop
And listen to niggas they never heard cause they love Hip Hop
I got so much drive I never need a pit stop
It's scarier than a whole hour of Alfred Hitchcock
I'll probably make your bottom lip drop when my shit drop
I'm in tip top condition
With a hustler's ambition
Ounce after ounce, me and Jizzle keep twisting
Until we get twisted like the caps on snitches
Just know our little passion will take you a long way
Like Pussy &amp; Patron can salvage a long day
I dive head first in a verse and swim away
And pull a pen out and throw a grenade at your brigade
Like a Skin Head, you're a barber that can't fade
I'm up all night trying to come up with something crazy
So while you sleeping like a baby
I'm a seal up the deal, no relation to the navy

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Uhn
I wake up in the morning and compose a rhyme doper than the last time before I even opened my eyes
Open-minded to the truth, but not naive to what is fiction
I probably love this more than my bitch, say I'm trippin'
Leave your ass in a ditch, if you can dig it
You mad cause I found my niche and you didn't
Too fucking bad
Fuck with Ab
And so you know, every sentence, it is from the Soul
