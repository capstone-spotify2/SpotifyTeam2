(We just met)
And I don't know if this is love just yet
But I'm flying so high in the sky
(And we) don't know how it's gonna end up
But all I know right now is that I'm flying so high
So, so, so
Is that I'm flying so high, so high
(We just met)

And now I'm floating on cloud nine
I could never come down, I was on the rise
I could ride like this forever
Whenever we're together, you turn good into better
Better into best, best into epic
The best love I ever felt, no one could invent this
Shorty came in my eye, I'm ready to fly
Forget about the rest, I kiss the world bye

(We just met)
And I don't know if this is love just yet
But I'm flying so high in the sky
(And we) don't know how it's gonna end up
But all I know right now is that I'm flying so high
So, so, so
Is that I'm flying so high, so high
(We just met)

And I'm just tripping on the way you got me tongue-tied
Never knowing what to say, but it's alright
The minute you look into my eyes, I get starstruck
So don't be minding all the haters I don't give a (hey!)
And I don't know if what I'm feeling is the real thing
But all I know is that you got me feeling real things
I feel it in my bones
I'm nervous I suppose
Even my momma knows! (hey, hey, that girl is a keeper)

And I don't know if this is love just yet
But I'm flying so high in the sky
(And we) don't know how it's gonna end up
But all I know right now is that I'm flying so high
So, so, so
Is that I'm flying so high, so high
(Just met)

I'm looking deep in your eyes
Them butterflies, baby boo, got me feeling alright
You're the green light, baby, you make my heart go!
You just might be the mate to my soul
So Imma keep on pursuing this baby, cause you never know
You just might have everything I need
I can see it my dreams, in my fantasies
Let's go make life simple, baby, you and me

And I don't know if this is love just yet
But I'm flying so high in the sky
(And we) don't know how it's gonna end up
But all I know right now is that I'm flying so high
So, so, so
Is that I'm flying so high, so high
