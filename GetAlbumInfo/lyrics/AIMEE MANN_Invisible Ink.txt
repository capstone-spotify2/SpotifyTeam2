There comes a time when you swim or sink
So I jumped in the drink
'Cause I couldn't make myself clear

Maybe I wrote in invisible ink
Oh, I've tried to think
How I could have made it appear

But another illustration is wasted 
'Cause the results are the same
I feel like a ghost who's trying to move your hands 
Over some Ouija board in the hopes I can spell out my name

What some take for magic at first glance 
Is just sleight-of-hand depending on what you believe
Something gets lost when you translate 
It's hard to keep straight
Perspective is everything

And I know now which is which and what angle I oughta look at it from
I suppose I should be happy to be misread
Better be that than some of the other things I have become

But nobody wants to hear this tale
The plot is clichÃ©d, the jokes are stale
And baby we've all heard it all before
Oh, I could get specific but
Nobody needs a catalog
With details of love I can't sell anymore

And aside from that, this chain of reaction,
Baby, is losing a link
Though I'd hope you'd know what I tried to tell you 
And if you don't I could draw you a picture in invisible ink

But nobody wants to hear this tale
The plot is clichÃ©d, the jokes are stale
And baby we've all heard it all before
Oh, I could get specific but 
Nobody needs a catalog
With details of love I can't sell anymore
