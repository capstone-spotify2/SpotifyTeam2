The world is a marble heart
Too fragile, too broken
Left without nothing but our bags to hold on to
Yeah out in the daylight
And out of the jungle
We could have been, we should have been
What your heart couldn't handle

Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see...
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me!

I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start...
And now you can't go breaking my heart
And now you can't go breaking my heart.

The world is a marble heart
It's bullshit and we know it
Like a flower sheltered in stone
With no chance of regrowing
Like push comes to shove
Like I'm out on your doorstep
We could have been, we should have been
With only my soul left.

Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see...
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me!

I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start...
And now you can't go breaking my heart
And now you can't go breaking my heart.

Tell me one more time, that we are over
Tell me one more time, that we are through
Work it, work it, work it, baby don't you
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me, come on now
Work it, work it, work it, baby don't you
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me, come on now
Tell me one more time, that we are over
Tell me one more time...

Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't...

And now you can't go breaking my heart
I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start...
And now you can't go breaking my heart
And now you can't go breaking my heart.
