Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

So you did it, do it again
Who you kidding, ten out of ten
Yeah, you did it, do it again
In a minute, I'll tell you when

Little pictures in my mind
But I got to make it on my own
If I try to fake it, it's a crime
'Cause I have my conscious saying take me home

But ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way

Ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way

Got the feeling, wanted some more
So appealing, baby I'm yours
Got the feeling, wanted it all
Keep on giving, I will for sure

Little pictures in my mind
But I got to make it on my own
If I try to fake it, it's a crime
'Cause I have my conscious saying take me home

But ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way

Ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

So you did it, do it again
What you've given was ten out of ten
Yeah, you did it, do it again
I'll admit it you're more than a friend

Ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way

Ooh baby I like it like that
Touch me, touch me before I turn back
Ooh baby I like it that way
Touch me, touch me a little this way
