Pop, rock, rhythm and blues, anything you got I don't have time to choose.
Big speakers, I'll sing along.
Last request DJ, I need a song.
He can't break my heart if I can't hear a word, I can't hear a word.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
I'll drown you out, 'cause I don't wanna let you go.
Anything to make you forget, 'cause my heart can't let go yet.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
(You spent me) frequency, if I find signal maybe, you won't leave.
Headphones, cover my ears.
Keep smiling, fight back the tears.
He can't break my heart if I can't hear a word, I can't hear a word.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
I'll drown you out, 'cause I don't wanna let you go.
Anything to make you forget, 'cause my heart can't let go yet.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
I'm turning up the radio.
Oooh woah, oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh. Radio,oh!
Oooh woah, oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh. Radio,oh!
I'll drown you out, don't say it now,'cause I'm turning up the radio.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
I'll drown you out, 'cause I don't wanna let you go.
Anything to make you forget, 'cause my heart can't let go yet.
Don't say it now, I'm turning up the radio.
