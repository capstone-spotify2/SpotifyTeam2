You called it quits
And hung up the phone
Now go love
The one you choose

And my friends say I should be happy
But if I'm happy
This is a good imitation of the blues

You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes

And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues

My friends all say
You're no good without me
They tell me
That's good for you

And they say that I'm
just feelin' fine
With this good imitation of the blues

You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes

And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues
