Somethin bout the way
Somethin bout the way you look
In my eyes
You make everything so damn easy
So easy that I don't got to worry bout a thing

And baby when we touch
All I can see is the image of us
Sitting by the ocean
Just before the dusk
Sippin on a juice box and
Sand between our toes

This is the part when we say were in love
And the part where we have our first kiss
But this ain't a movie
I know you can't come with me
You got your life
He better be treatin you right

Just tell me you don't love me
Tell me you don't feel the same way that I do

Tell me I don't make you smile
Like I do when you walk in the room
You're so, so hard to let go

Oh and this is the part when we say were in love
And the part where we say it's forever
But this ain't a fantasy
I know you can't come with me
You got your life
He better be treatin you right
You got your life
He better be treatin you right

This hurts so much to know that you're
With someone else when you should be with me
It's just hard to accept that I can't be around
He better be treatin you good
I'm no einstein but I know a sign
When I see one
And I know you love me too,
And I know you love me too

Oh and this is the part when we say were in love
And the part where we have our first kiss
But this ain't a movie
I know you can't come with me
You got your life
He better be treatin you good, so good
You got your life
He better be treatin you, treatin you,
Treatin you right, treatin you right
