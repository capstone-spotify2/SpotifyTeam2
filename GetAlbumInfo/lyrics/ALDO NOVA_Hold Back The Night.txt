I've got a lover
Giving me the heat
A burning fever
And it's leaving me weak

My heart's on fire
And I'm losing control
'Cause when the morning comes
I can never let her go

Hold back
Hold back the night
I couldn't stand to lose you by daylight
Hold back
Hold back the night
There's so much to give
I'm begging you to
Hold back
Hold back the night

This desire feels so sweet
Taking me higher
What happening to me?
My body's shaking
Like it never has before
'Cause you got me aching
For you more and more

Hold back
Hold back the night
I couldn't stand to lose you by daylight
Hold back
Hold back the night
There's so much to give
I'm begging you to
Hold back
Hold back the night

Hold back the night
Hold back the night
Hold back the night

Oh yeah
Come over here
Tell you something, tell you something
Yeah, yeah, come on

Well, I got a lover, a lover
She's giving me the heat
It's like a fever
Ooh, it's leaving me weak, yeah

Oh, my heart's on fire
And I'm losing control
But when the morning comes
I can never let her go

Hold back
Hold back the night
I couldn't stand to lose you by daylight
Hold back
Hold back the night
There's so much to give
I'm begging you to
Hold

Hold back
Hold back the night
Hold back
Hold back
