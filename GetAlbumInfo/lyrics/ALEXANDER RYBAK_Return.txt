It's almost night, I should be sleeping.
But the moon's so bright, as if it's praying with me.
Round and round, I walk in circles aimlessly.
Where could you be?

The purple skies were so inviting
When we used to fly.
But the excitement slowly fades away.
Feels like there's nothing I wanna do.
Not without you.

And I will cry you a thousand tears
The day you will return.
Tonight I swear, I'll stay right here
Until you will return.

And every little cloud,
And every single star,
Reminds me of just how much I miss you.
