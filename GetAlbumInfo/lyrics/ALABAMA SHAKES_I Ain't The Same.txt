Well, I've been going through the motions
Wonder if anyone can see
That I been looking for something
Have you been looking for me

I ain't the same no more
In fact I have changed from before
No, you ain't gonna find me
Oh no, cause I'm not who I used to be

Well, I used to be a little girl
Just a smiling, feeling free
I wasn't worried bout nobody
Nobody worried bout me

But, I ain't the same no more
You'll find I have changed from before
No, you ain't gonna find me
Cause I ain't who I used to be

I said I'd never grow old
I can't remember how that used to be
I find myself without the power
I find myself without the glory

Listen! I ain't the same no more
You'll find I have changed from before
You ain't gonna find me
Oh no, cause I'm not who I used to be
Oh, no, no, I ain't who I used to be
Oh, no, no, I ain't who I used to be
Oh, no...
