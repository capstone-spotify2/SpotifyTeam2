I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighbourhood
The way she move, I must confess
I like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine
I'll make her wet, I'll make her mine
She like it hard, she like it slow
All right honey, come on let's go

Baby feel what you want, it's the way she move
Baby feel what you need, come on let's go

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil
I wanna cover you in oil
Cover you in oil

Pull on the zip, she give good lip service
It's nothing for the show, I just pay to see her go
She make you hot, you spray your lot
Come on in honey, we're headin' to the top
The way she push, don't give a dime
Abuse your life, gonna make you satisfied
She's kinda rough, she give it tough
Come on honey and strut your stuff

Baby feel what you want, it's the way she move
Baby feel what you need, come on let's go

<i>[Chorus]</i>
