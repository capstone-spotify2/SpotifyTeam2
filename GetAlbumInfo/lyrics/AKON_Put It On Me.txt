Ok, yea
Akon, Young Swift

Girl, do your dance, let's play ring around the Rosay
Money in the air and my pockets full of mo cheese
Asses, asses, drop 'em to the floor please
Pick it up, bring it back, put that pussy on me

Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me
Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me

Diggin' artifact, a shovel to a pot of gold
Bounce 'er like it's track, love the way she drop it low
Show her how to act, directin' how this movie goes
Bring that back, now welcome to the Kezza Show
She got a lot of niggas on the lot
Spendin' lot of money, tryna get between her thighs
Yea, and they say she want the dollar
Have to crawl in like a dog with your own collar

Girl, do your dance, let's play ring around the Rosay
Money in the air and my pockets full of mo cheese
Asses, asses, drop 'em to the floor please
Pick it up, bring it back, put that pussy on me

Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me
Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me

Got on that gold Rollie, curtsey of the homie
And it's flooded in ice, baby come and put it on me
This here just something light, every night â 20 on me
I'm talking one night only, not like my one and only
Bad bitch, dumpee
Wanna fuck now cause they signed me
It ain't hard to come find me
Just get in mind never mind me
Got a couple niggas, that's flossy
Couple niggas, that's grind me
Know a few hoes who queue holes
That pop bottles, Malis
Standin' on the couch, baby up the shit
We the flyest niggas in here, who you fuckin' with?
Put a U comb where you bring your girl, machete dick
Now put that pussy on me like I'm wearin' it

Girl, do your dance, let's play ring around the Rosay
Money in the air and my pockets full of mo cheese
Asses, asses, drop 'em to the floor please
Pick it up, bring it back, put that pussy on me

Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me
Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me

She got ass so I told 'er move it slowly
She said she bought it so I told that bitch to show me
Bust that pussy open, she said daddy daddy okay
Put that pussy on me like daddy have it your way
Down skin I know she got that web with
Come here, through the skin, you know a nigga like that
As I bleed it up, I told 'er don't you fight back
Fuck around and threw it back
Told me how you like that?

Girl, do your dance, let's play ring around the Rosay
Money in the air and my pockets full of mo cheese
Asses, asses, drop 'em to the floor please
Pick it up, bring it back, put that pussy on me

Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me
Put it on me, baby put it on me
Put it on me, put that pussy on me
