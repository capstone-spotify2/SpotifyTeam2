Well rumor has it so they say
She was broke down on the highway
She was checkin' it out
She was underneath the hood
When up rolled some country boys up to no good and makin' noise
To help the lady out like a good ole boy should
The two came up on each side and said
Hey honey you want a ride
One winked and the other gave her a little pinch
And so the story goes she hauled off and broke his nose
With her daddy's diamond horseshoe monkey wrench

She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo

Well pretty girls these days get straight on top in so many ways
Things in show biz and those glamour magazines
Nah she's not one to befriend the latest so called fashion trend
She just naturally looks fine in those tight blue jeans

She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo

No she's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Boys you been warned so now you know
So straighten up and act your age
You'll be lookin' down the barrel
Of her daddy's 12 guage

She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo

Lord she's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
No she's no sweetheart of the rodeo
