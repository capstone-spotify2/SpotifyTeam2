Today I took some paper from the closet 
And wrapped the wedding ring 
You left behind 
And I addressed it to the man 
Who vowed to love you 
And on the little card 
I wrote these words inside 

Merry Christmas to me 
Just one gift beneath my tree 
For the fool who let you leave 
Merry Christmas to me

Then I sat down in my chair 
And thought about you 
About the many reasons why you're gone 
And I opened up the present that I gave to me 
And realized how much it hurts to be alone 

Merry Christmas to me 
Just one gift beneath my tree 
For the fool who let you leave 
Merry Christmas to me

I'm the fool who let you leave 
Merry Christmas to me...
