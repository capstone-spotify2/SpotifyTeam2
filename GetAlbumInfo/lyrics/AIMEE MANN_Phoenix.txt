Got out of Phoenix, just in time
A box of kleenex, for the ride
The tumbleweeds said, their goodbyes
To javelinas and DUIs

I don't want to abandon you but baby I've had my fill
You love me like a dollar bill
You roll me up and trade me in
And if you had the chance you will
And if you get the chance again

It's hard to know when to cut and run
You balance heartache with your fun
And when the scales tip, you know you're done

I don't want to abandon you but baby I've had my fill
You love me like a dollar bill
You roll me up and trade me in
And if you had the chance you will
And if you get the chance again

Cos I know love doesn't change anything at all
I know love doesn't change a thing

I wanted to believe in you and baby I believe it still
Baby I've just had my fill
You love me like a dollar bill
You roll me up and trade me in
And if you have the chance you will
And if you get the chance again
I know you'll do the best you can

But baby love doesn't change anything at all
I know love doesn't change a thing
