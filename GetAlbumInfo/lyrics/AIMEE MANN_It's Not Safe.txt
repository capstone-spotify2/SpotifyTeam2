All you want to do is something good
So get ready to be ridiculed and misunderstood
'Cause don't you know that you're a fucking freak in this world
In which everybody's willing to choose swine over pearls

And maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else

You can take your own advice and try again
But a thousand compromises don't add up to a win
And they'd be happy if you'd only cover your tracks
But the trail of crumbs you've left won't help you find your way back

So maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

You can play along, but you'll just end up wrong somehow, won't you

But you're the idiot who keeps believing in luck
And you just can't get it through your head that no one else gives a fuck

So maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

God knows it's not safe with anybody else
It's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

(Play that guitar
But you're the idiot who keeps believing in luck
The speaker is out of the picture
I'm talking to the microphone
The microphone thinks that I'm talking
But I'm not talking at all
I'm singing to you)
