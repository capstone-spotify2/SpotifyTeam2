Piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay,
And we go home poor at the end of the day.
But I'd rather live my life in rags
Than be taped to a desk with a wife that's a hag.

We live each day like there's nothing to lose,
But a man has needs and that need is booze.
They say all the best things in life are free
So give all your beer and your rum to me.

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at the point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

We sailed over seas for Wenches and Mead
And told great tales of The Huntmaster's deeds
The quest for a drop of the Famous ol' Spiced
Has shown us the wrath of Leviathan's bites.

We went Back Through Time to get more Rum
Though we end up Shipwrecked having no fun
But Heavy Metal Pirates we must be
So give all your beer and your rum to me.

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at the point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer
