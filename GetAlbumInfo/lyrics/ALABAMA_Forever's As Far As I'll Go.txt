I'll admit I could feel it
The first time that we touched.
The look in your eyes
Said you felt as much
But I'm not a man
Who falls so easily
It's best that you know
Where you stand with me

I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do
But I've thought about
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go.

When there's age around my eyes
And gray in your hair
And it only takes a touch to recall
The love we've shared
I won't take for granted
That you know my love is true
Each night in your arms
I will whisper to you.

I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do
But I've thought about
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go.
