Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

But I am beautiful, no matter what they say
Words won't bring me down
But I am beautiful in every single way
Words won't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
You're so consumed in all your doom
You're trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone you left the puzzle undone
That's the way it is

You are beautiful, no matter what they say
Words won't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Words won't bring you down
Oh no, so don't you bring me down today

(No matter what we do)
No matter what we do
(No matter what we say)
No matter what they say
(We're the song inside the tune)
We're full of beautiful mistakes

(Everywhere we go)
Everywhere you go
(The sun will always shine)
The sun will always shine
(Tomorrow we might awake)
On the other side
(On the other side)

You are beautiful, no matter what they say
Words won't bring you down
'Cause we are beautiful in every single way
Words won't bring us down
Oh no, so don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today
