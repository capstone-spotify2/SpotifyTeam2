I keep changing
I go and I don't know why I am waiting
For somebody to come along and save me
Whilst I'm on the floor
I gotta find my way out here for sure

So I try, pick up all the pieces
I try, straighten out the creases
I try, to make it work for me
In turn now I believe

That I'll be fine
I'm like the colours of the rainbow
Red, white, gold and blue
I'm changing all the time
It's hard for me to cry so I do, what I do
Red, white, gold and blue

No more playing,
Feeling like no one hears what I'm saying
Done with all the obstacles I've put here
No more running scared
Painting my own picture now instead

It's my time, to shine a light within
It's my time, been trying for so long
It's my time, to make it work for me
In turn I will believe that

That I'll be fine
I'm like the colours of the rainbow
Red, white, gold and blue
I'm changing all the time
It's hard for me to cry so I do, what I do
Red, white, gold and blue

Taking me back to where the story started
Turning the page, things come around and then they go
Taking me back to everything
A part of me had to go

That's why I'm like the colours of the rainbow
Red, white, gold and blue
I'm changing all the time
It's hard for me to cry so I do, what I do
Red, white, gold and blue

I'm like the colours of the rainbow
Red, white, gold and blue
I'm changing all the time
It's hard for me to cry so I do, what I do
Red, white, gold and blue
Red, white, gold and blue
Red, white and gold
Red, white and gold

I'm like the colours of the rainbow
Red, white, gold and blue
I'm changing all the time
It's hard for me to cry so I do, what I do
Red, white, gold and blue
