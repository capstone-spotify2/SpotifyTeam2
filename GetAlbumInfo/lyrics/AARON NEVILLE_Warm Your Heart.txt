Well, we're all searching for peace of mind
Love in this world is hard to find
Come close to me, hold my hand
And warm your heart

Only a true love, can satisfy
Open your arms and close your eyes
Walk with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart

Well, you're the reason, for the way I'm feelin'
'Cause I've never felt this way before
I want to make you, ohh so happy
That's all I'm livin' for, yea

Just sorrow, yes, you should know
We need each other when lights are low
Stay with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart

Well, you're the reason, for the way I'm feelin'
'Cause I've never felt this way before
I want to make you, ohh so happy
That's all I'm livin' for

So come to me and make things right
I'll keep you happy, both day and night
Stay with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart
