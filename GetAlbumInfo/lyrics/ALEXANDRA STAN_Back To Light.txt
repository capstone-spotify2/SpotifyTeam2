Been looking for an answer
Been looking through desert of time
Been waiting forever,
And tryna find my way

Back to light
Back to light
Back to light
Back to light

Don't know what it means
Don't know where I've been
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down
Don't be so mean, you'll cause a scene
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down

Been looking for a treasure
Buried so deep behind my eyes
Been waiting forever
And tryna find my way

Back to light
Back to light
Back to light
Back to light

I'm going back to light

Don't know what it means
Don't know where I've been
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down
Don't be so mean, you'll cause a scene
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down

I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in back to light
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in back to light

Don't know what it means
Don't know where I've been
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down
Don't be so mean, you'll cause a scene
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down
