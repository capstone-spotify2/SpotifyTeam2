You take my breath away...

But I'll never again taste your lips
As fate keeps me locked away
I must close my eyes to see your face

Emptiness has darkened my eyes
As I hopelessly beg for my life to end
Tell me why
My iron eyes tell the tale
Heroes always pay in their blood...
I can be only this

I see the fear growing in their lost eyes
My purpose is so clear... I am the ax
I am the ax and this is why I must not fear the end
And when I'm gone will you forget me?
(Will you forget)
Pen wears its steady course across the page
(Forget) Resigned to it's designs to take the hive

Emptiness has darkened my eyes
As I hopelessly beg for my life to end
Tell me why

Emptiness has darkened my eyes
As I hopelessly beg for my life to end
Tell me why
(I wish I could make you see, I wish I could make you see through the pain
through the end, I wish I could make you see the greater purpose that I have to serve...
No one else will fight... No one else will fight... so I must)

My iron eyes tell the tale
Heroes always pay in their blood...
I can be only this

I am the ax
Fear has been lost to faith
The darkened night has come before the end
Of which we must prevail
Amidst the pitch of steel we shall arise
I will destroy all those who oppose me

My iron eyes tell the tale
Heroes always pay in their blood...
I can be only this
My iron eyes tell the tale
Heroes always pay in their blood...
I can be only this

I see the fear growing in there
