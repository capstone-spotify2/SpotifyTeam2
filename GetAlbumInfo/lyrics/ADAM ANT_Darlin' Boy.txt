Any messages Miss Moneypenny
They tried so hard
But there will never be
There will never be
Another Connery
Disco volante

Darlin' boy darlin' face
Parks his car in your space
Darlin' smile don't entertain
That deadly gaze
You'll never love again
Oh darlin', sweet darlin'

Oh don't come so close to you
No good for you
This perfect man
Too good to be true
Take your sex above beyond
A sack artist
The name is blonde

Darlin' boy, darlin' curls
Hypnotises all the girls

Darlin' boy, loves the chase
Parks his tongue in your face
Darlin' boy, darlin' curls
Hypnotises all the girls
Darlin' girl, save your breath
Walk away he's the kiss of death
Oh darlin' girl, save your breath
Walk away he's the kiss of death

Heaven's in the back seat
Of his car
Lips as hot
As Hiroshima
