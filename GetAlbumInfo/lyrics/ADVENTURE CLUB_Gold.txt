Only sunshine, under the bright sky
Only sunshine, under the bright sky

When the words are like bullets and they break through your skin
And there's no way to get them all out
When it feels like rust seeping into your soul

Stay gold
Stay gold
Stay gold

Under the bright sky
Only sunshine
Under the bright sky

Stay gold
Stay gold
Stay gold
Stay gold 
Stay gold
Stay gold 

You were always searching, for something out there
Out of reach, couldn't stop you, couldn't hold you back
You were so real. so real

When the words are like bullets and they break through your skin
And there's no way to get them all out
When it feels like rust seeping into your soul

Stay gold
Stay gold
Stay gold

Under the bright sky. only sunshine
Under the bright sky. only sunshine
Stay gold
