Wake up Jack get ready
Here we come to rock this town
Hold on tight and steady
Over, under, sideways, down

You must feel the power
Fix your eyes upon the stage
Watch us now devour
Everything that gets in our way

Your fascination with my creation
Adds stimulation rock till you drop
Hard rock nation, lost generation
End the frustration! Get shot full of rock

Get shot full of rock
Get shot full of rock

Taste the hard rock candy
Guaranteed to melt in your mouth
Jump back now Jim Dandy
East, west, north and south

Catch the rush all over
Take a chance if you dare
Ain't got time for posers
Look out Dick! You better beware
