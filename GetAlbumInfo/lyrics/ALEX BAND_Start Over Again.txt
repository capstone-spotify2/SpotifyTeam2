Life can bring you down
Then turn you around
Well, just take it from me
And you will see, you will see

That time will tell us when
To start again, start over again
Whoa, time will tell us when
To start again, start over again

Life can bring you up
And steal your luck
Well, just take it from me
And you will see, you will see

That time will tell us when
To start again, start over again
Whoa, time will tell us when
To start again, start over again

Time
Time, yeah
Time

After all you've done
You thought there'd be someone
Who'd give you everything you want
After all this time
You think they'd throw you a line
To let you know it's gonna be alright

It's gonna be alright

'Cause time will tell us when
To start again, start over again
Whoa, time will tell us when
To start again, start over again
