As the shadow looms over
Covers me and I can't see
So you better move over
Cause I can't breathe
There's a fiery eye in the middle of the dark sea
And it's pulling me down
So I can't breathe
And as you pull out your gun point blank got a feeling this can't be
The air is moving around me but I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Is this love?
When the sun goes down
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
But this love, it's just not enough for me
It's just not enough for me
Finally I've come around

An extension of hope, this could be misleading
Could you write it down now
Cause I can't speak
And it cuts like a knife in the cracks that I can't reach
And you're pulling me down so I can't breathe
And there's a fiery eye in the middle of the dark sea
And it's pulling me down so I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Is this love?
When the sun goes down
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
But this love, it's just not enough for me
It's just not enough for me
Finally I've come around
