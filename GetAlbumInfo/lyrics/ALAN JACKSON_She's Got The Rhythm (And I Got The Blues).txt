This old bar stool's feelin' higher
'Cause I've started sinkin' lower
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Not long ago I held her, like a fool I went and left her
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor

And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showin' me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's tellin' me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues

Well that music's gettin' louder
As my heart keeps beatin' faster
As she spells out regret in perfect time
Well I thought I wanted freedom but that ball and chain I need 'em
'Cause when you choose sometimes you lose the prize

'Cause she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showin' me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's tellin' me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
Yeah with her every little move she's tellin' me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
