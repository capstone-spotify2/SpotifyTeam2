You gotta be a strong man
And know what you want,
And fight ev'ryone in your way

You're the one who sweats
And what do you get
When someone else picks up your pay

Hey, when you're fightin' a wolf,
it's a fight to the end with a pack

You work all day long,
You're stuck to the phone
Burn up a hundred cigarettes

The yes - men you know
They tell you no go
And dissatisfaction's all you get

Oh, when you're needing a queen
ev'ry card that you get is a jack

Accept what we do
This message to you
Is rock forever and ever
We've still got the feel
The music is real
And we'll rock'n'roll forever, forever

You gotta be strong
We'll rock'n'roll
Forever

No sword and no knife
Can help you survive
Survival is a busines head

A good deal you need
Or you're lost in their greed
You're rotten, helpless, dead

Hey, when you're fightin' a wolf,
it's a fight to the end with a pack

Accept what we do
This message to you
Is rock forever and ever
We've still got the feel
The music is real
And we'll rock'n'roll forever, forever

Accept what we do
This message to you
Is rock forever and ever
We've still got the feel
The music is real
And we'll rock'n'roll forever
