How did it happen it was never really clear
I never thought that you and I would still be here
So many nights of love and many more to come
When we would sing together till the song was sung

I don't know when it was my heart began to fly
I don't remember when the music made me cry
We only did what was so natural to do
And all the things you said to me I want to give to you

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything

When all the world was listening to the radio
We had to close our eyes and turn the lights down low
And when that song would play we stared into the light
And when I held you close we fell into the night

Each little note would leave a trail across my heart
And every tear would be a candle in the dark
I don't know how it all began so long ago
It's not for us to understand its only love that needs to know

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>

Like a fleeting dream, when we meet it seems
We are caught in between, and there's only tonight
And this moment feels so right

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
