I thought about you, last night
About you, I thought about you <i>[2x]</i>

It's like they use to say
You'll never gonna survive
Unless you're just a little crazy
Jump right in the game of love
Start believin' in that someone
You can really trust

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Last night
I thought about you
(And the miracles of things that you do)
Last night
I thought about you
(And everyday your ways, I'll thank you)

You're just the one for me
And I believe you'll never leave
Take care my heart and soul
Never left to take a full control

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Last night
I thought about you
(And the miracles of things that you do)
Last night
I thought about you
(And everyday your ways, I'll thank you)
<i>[REPEAT CHORUS]</i>

You, you brighten my life
So many times
And believe me
I'm so satisfied
I know I'm sure
I found what I was lookin' for

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Last night
I thought about you
(And the miracles of things that you do)
Last night
I thought about you
(And everyday your ways, I'll thank you)
