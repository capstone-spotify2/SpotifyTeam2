You pulled me in
When it was light
Amongst the grass we shared our lives
And though I'm thrown
At least I know
I want more complicated days

Why should this stop
Before it starts
I want to give us our best chance
If it goes wrong
We will move on
But first more complicated days

This wonât be the first time that I've thrown myself away
This wonât be the first time that I fall
This wonât be the first time I put someone in my way
But simple things no longer interest me at all

And I am lost
And I am torn
And somehow I am comfortable
So I wonât quit
Or question this
Without more complicated days

You are unsure
But so am I
You know we share that clouded sky
And I wonât go
I hope you know
Iâll bring more complicated days

This wonât be the first time that I've thrown myself away
This wonât be the first time that I fall
This wonât be the first time I put someone in my way
But simple things no longer interest me at all

This wonât be the first time that I've thrown myself away
This wonât be the first time that I fall
This wonât be the first time I put someone in my way
But simple things no longer interest me at all
But simple things no longer interest me at all
