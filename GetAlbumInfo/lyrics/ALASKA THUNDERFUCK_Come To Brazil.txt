Come, come, come
Come to Brazil
Come, come, come
Come to Brazil
Come, come, come
Come to Brazil
Come, come, come
Come to Brazil!

So I'm walking in the club and I'm like "Oi, migas!"
And what do I see
But the most gorgeous, sexy man I've ever laid eyes up on
And just when I think it's love at first sight
I realize we're both "passivonas"
Ugh

Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it twice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it thrice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Oi! Whoo!

Britney, Mariah, Shania, CÃ©line
They all want to come to Brazil, baby
Rihanna, Ariana and Gaga and me
We all want to come to Brazil, baby
So co-o-o-o-ome!
Come to Brazil!
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!

So I'm walking down the streets
Of one of Brazil's gorgeous cities
And I keep hearing people yell "Crackuda! Crackuda!"
Now, I don't speak portuguese
But I can only assume that "Crackuda" means
"Gorgeous, beautiful, young woman"
...Right?

Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it twice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Brazil is so nice, so I'll say it thrice
Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice, Brazil is so nice
Oi! Whoo!

Britney, Mariah, Shania, CÃ©line
They all want to come to Brazil, baby
Rihanna, Ariana and Gaga and me
We all want to come to Brazil, baby
So co-o-o-o-ome!
Come to Brazil!
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!

In Brazil they speak "Portugayse"
Which is the language of love
Do you wanna hear some words that I learned how to say?
I really think I've taken command of the language
Alright, sure, okay, here we go
Porto Alegre
Fortaleza
Curitiba
BrasÃ­lia
Rio
SÃ£o Paulo
Uh!

Britney, Mariah, Shania, Selena
They all want to come to Brazil, baby
Rihanna, Ariana and Gaga and me
We all want to come to Brazil, baby
So co-o-o-o-ome!
Come to Brazil!
(Come to Brazil!)
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!
(Ohh, Brazil!)
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
Come to Brazil!
Oh, oh, o-o-o-oh, oh, oh
(Come to Brazil, come to Brazil, come to Brazil!)

I like that!
