I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself (myself)
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else (no one else)

So, no, I know I should've treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever (forever)

So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Because it is
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say
What did she say?

How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go (love go)
And, ooh, when I do with one chance
I just gotta let you know yeah

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together (together)

So let me in, give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Because it is
Mmmm, whatcha say,
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say
What did she say?

Girl, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right, girl
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said)?
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We'll be living so large
