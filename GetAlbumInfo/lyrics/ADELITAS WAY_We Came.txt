The dream of somehow left you out again
Sending never left me but the worry now I can't sense it
Cause I don't like just what you are
I don't like your point of view
You send them somewhere else to lay
Show me why we care

Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I'm a little smarter, not in playing games
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came

I tamed all that you know the end
Should have never left me
Cause you feel it now so stop pretending

Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I'm a little smarter, not in playing games
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came

I came to stop all of you out, again
Should have never let me cause we're worried now we might...in

Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I'm a little smarter, not in playing games
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
I think it's not my shoot, you are, we came
