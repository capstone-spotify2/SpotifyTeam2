On the red eye up a mile high
With an angel screw-driving me all night
Push the button to keep her comin'
I want it so bad, why can't I have

A woman like that
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like you

On the freeway in the fast lane
Lights a flashing she can cuff me all day
Coz blondes with big guns are always more fun
I want it so bad, why can't I have

A woman like that
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like you
You're the best I never had
Baby, I want a woman like you

A mouthful of garter
Is just a starter
Into the main course
She's making it harder
It's all seduction
Without the touchin'
I want it so bad

Why can't I have
A woman like that
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like you

Woman like that
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like that
A woman like that
Why can't I have
A woman like you
I want it so bad
You're the best I never had
Wht can't I have
A woman like you
