Been in this cell block seven years too long
Paying for a crime when I didn't do anything wrong
Lyin' here rottin' for someone else's mistake
I've come to my senses, it's time to make a break

Breakout, I'm coming after you
Breakout, I'd say our love is overdue
Breakout, I'm at the breakin' point
Breakout, gonna bust of this joint

I'm sick and tired of punching out license plates
For a criminal justice system that I hate
The food here suck, I'm not about to wait
Well I've come to my senses It's time to make a break

Breakout, I'm coming after you
Breakout, I'd say our love is overdue
Breakout, I'm at the breakin' point
Breakout, gonna bust of this joint
