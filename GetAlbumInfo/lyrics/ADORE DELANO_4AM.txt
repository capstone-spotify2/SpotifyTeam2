It's 4AM and I'm staring at the ceiling
Every word I sing is losing all its meaning
4AM and I think I'm about to lose it
My life is a mess but I'll always choose it

And I guess I don't need my family
No, no, no, no
And I guess I don't need my friends
No, no, no, no
And I guess I don't need the love of my life
No, no, no, no
I clip my wings and look at the sky

I need a moment
As tears run down my eyes
My love has left me
All that's left to do is cry, cry, cry

It's 4AM and they think they really know me
This smile on my face doesn't always come easy
4AM and I think I'm about to lose it
My life is a mess but I'll always choose it

And I guess I don't need my family
No, no, no, no
And I guess I don't need my friends
No, no, no, no
And I guess I don't need the love of my life
No, no, no, no
I clip my wings and look at the sky

I need a moment
As tears run down my eyes
My love has left me
All that's left to do is cry, cry, cry

This is what everybody dreams of
This is what everybody tries
This is what everybody dreams of
And it's all mine
Yeah it's all mine

I need a moment
As tears run down my eyes
My love has left me
All that's left to do is cry, cry, cry
