Let's talk it over now
We both have a lot to say
Let's get it over now
We can't let it go this way

We've shed our tears, we've played our parts
We've had our fears and broken hearts
But now it's time to stop this game
This foolish masquerade

It's just a game we play
We look at love through eyes so blind
So don't give your love away
'Cause in my heart you'll always be mine

So think it over now
'Cause you would be a fool to say
That it's over now
And we'll both turn and walk away

We play the games that lovers play
We wear our masks in false charades
We roll the dice then turn away
But now it's time we said

It's just a game we play
We look at love through eyes so blind
So don't give your love away
'Cause in my heart you'll always be mine
Baby, you'll always be mine

But it's just a game we play
We look at love through eyes so blind
So don't give your love away
'Cause in my heart you'll always be mine

So don't go play the fools game
Baby, you'll always be mine
And don't go play the fool, baby
Baby, you'll always be mine
And don't go play the fool, baby
Baby, you'll always be mine

'Cause you know I love you, baby
Baby, you'll always be mine
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, you'll always be mine
