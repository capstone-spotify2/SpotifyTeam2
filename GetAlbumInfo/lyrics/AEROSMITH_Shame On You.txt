Somebody tryin' to take my soul 
Nobody gotta hear my rock n' roll 

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame on you baby 

Lolita, steady as it goes 
Toot sweet, powder in her nose 

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame on you babe 

Hey Smith, old hank pank 
Pulling down your knickers 
Ah, who you gonna spank 

Shame, shame, on you baby 
Shame, shame, shame on you babe 

Joe Perry, oooh Mr Style 
Some kind of killer bee 
Buzz a while 

Phoned home last night
P.M.S.
Bitch bitch bitchin'
Gotta do this gotta do that

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame, shame shame on you baby 

Bogus honey, square dance close 
Oh, grab your partner, a bring it home 'n dosey, dosey 

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame on you baby

Why's uncle Stanley 
Tryin to keep it hid 

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame on you baby 

Seven or eleven 
Got to roll the dice 
Am I in heaven 
Or am I in Miami Vice 

Shame, shame, shame on you babe 
Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame on you baby
