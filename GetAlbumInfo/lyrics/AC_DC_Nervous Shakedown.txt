Freeze said the man cruising the beat
You get your hands up spread your feet
Don't you move an inch I heard him say
Or you'll be doing time until the judgement day
And he said
Don't tell me no lies give me alibis
Cause if you cross my path you'll be doing life
It's a dirty lie
It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

It's lookin' like a set-up

Take a dime said the man you can make one call
You got a one way ticket to the county hall
When then judge looked high and I looked low
When he smiled at me it was a one man show
He said
2 to 5 the jury decides
Double parole if you survive
It's a dirty lie
It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

Lord they're gonna get you this time
And throw away the key

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
You got a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown

Lord they're gonna get you this time throw away the key

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
You got a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)

Shake it down shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Shake it down shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
It's a shakedown
It's a shakedown
On
You
Yes
