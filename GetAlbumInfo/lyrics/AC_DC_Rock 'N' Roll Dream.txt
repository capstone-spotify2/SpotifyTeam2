Deep water all around me
Circle sharks all about
Deep in trouble
Had me turned around
Man up and one man down
You pretty women gather 'round
You can't pick up not a single sound
You feel you're winning that's what it's all about
Knowing you are winning
And it could be the very last time

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

Circle sharks all about you
You come up and you don't know why
Where goes a woman with a warm embrace
Does a man walk in the hard rain
I'm amazed at the mess you found
Coming up and I'm standing next in line
Give into none and that one comes
Here me hollerin' I get the most

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

Circle sharks down and around
Deep water all around, 'round, 'round
Deep water all around and 'round

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
