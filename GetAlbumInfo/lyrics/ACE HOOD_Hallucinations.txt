Uh, Feeling like I been crucified
Haven't been the same since my daughter died
Paranormal flourished than my state of mind
Kinda hard for me to orchestrate a fucking rhyme
Last night I took some pain killers
And I became friends with a death dealer
Couple minutes later I was stupid numb
Slowly blinking, thinking where I got this pistol from
Damn I was fucked up
Still wonder why my daddy had abandoned us
Lost my dog when he decided to put them hammers up
Left the dope game so crackers couldn't jam him up
Heatin' pain off in my cold heart
These niggas playing foul like a false start
How my youngest pull your card like it's Hallmark
Choppa stop a nigga like a cross guard

Oh Lord I'm a mad man
Screaming starvation to the motherland
Never money over brothers man
I don't think they understand
Hear the pain that I'm so poor
It's like the lions when the pack roar
Come meet the last of a dying breed
Guaranteed that this some shit you've never seen
Black man, no college degree
Still a made a way for my mama to eat
Million dollars made and I did it in peace
But still I am a flirt to the fucking police
I forever be a field nigga
As long God with me, I'm a deal with em
Paranoid only Lord knows
Thinking I'm seeing people and the phantom ghosts

God Bless
