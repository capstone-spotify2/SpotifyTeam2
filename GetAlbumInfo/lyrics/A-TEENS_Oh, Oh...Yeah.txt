Stop
And take those big blue eyes
Back out of my heart
It don't belong to you

But maybe it could
It sure has crossed my mind
I gotta be strong
I gotta be true this time

But as we kiss goodbye
I don't even know why I ain't movin'
Ain't walkin' away

See on the surface you're this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you can't hide

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh, oh, sugar ain't as sweet as you
Oh, oh, monkey see as monkey do
And I could get addicted
Sure as every movie is
Oh, oh, yeah

Hot
Like baby mid-July
Your ninety degrees
No shade when you walk by

I'm falling for you
And that is falling bad
I gotta do right
So I don't lose what I have

And when you smile at me
Baby I just can't wait to be leavin'
Be miles away

See on the surface youre' this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you can't hide

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Hey! Sugar ain't as sweet as you

On the surface you're this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you cant hide

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh, oh, sugar ain't as sweet as you
Oh, oh, honey bees get jealous too
We're perfectly connected
Sure as we both need this here
Oh, oh, yeah
