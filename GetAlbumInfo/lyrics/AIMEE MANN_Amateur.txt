I'm told the case is now closed
So I can come to my senses
But when the question is posed
I'll have this meager defense

I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before

Despite conclusions I drew
There was a chance you'd surprise me
And you'd be better than new
'Cause I'd have left otherwise

I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before

So I wasn't thinking clearly
So you didn't think at all
I thought that was protocol

I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before

I was hoping that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
