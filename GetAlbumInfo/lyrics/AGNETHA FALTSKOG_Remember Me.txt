As you walk from my side
The tears I try to hide
Are running down my cheek 
I find it hard to speak 
This is our last goodbye
But darling will you please

Remember me from time to time
The one who loves you
Remember me from time to time
I won't forget you
Oh please remember me
And I 'll remember too

I watch you walk away 
But in my mind you stay
An everlasting dream
To me you've always been
And please don't turn around as you walk away 

Remember me from time to time
The one who loves you
Remember me from time to time
I won't forget you
Oh please remember me
And I 'll remember too

Remember me from time to time
The one who loves you
Remember me from time to time
I won't forget you
Oh please remember me
And I 'll remember too
I remember 
So please remember...
