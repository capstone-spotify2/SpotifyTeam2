You're the devil's daughter in disguise*
So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
Darlin' then you can come back home

You sure can shake your little round behind
But your hour glass figure won't buy my time
You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before
This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

When Fort Worth is east of Dallas
And Texans forget the Alamo
When Lubbock opens up a ski resort
And the Brazos is straighter than an arrow

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
Darlin' then you can come back home
But don't hold your breath
