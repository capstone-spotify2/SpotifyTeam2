Missy it's been too long
And I feel the same
You should just turn around
Don't come here again
And I think they told you right
Things aren't the same
But you put the blame on me
And you know you'll say that I've changed
Say that I've changed
But look around you

Someone who saw you, said you're well
I can't stay
Nothing wish you well
I can't stay
Guess who you know shields it all?
Loved you, not fun in the end
You didn't know, until I was gone
Loved you, not fun in the end
In the end
In the end

If you seen me walking by
Would you know my face?
And look at the pain you've caused
It's so numb, don't come here again
You say that I've changed
But look around you

Someone who saw you, said you're well
I can't stay
Nothing wish you well
I can't stay
Guess who you know shields it all?
Loved you, not fun in the end
You didn't know, until I was gone
Loved you, not fun in the end
In the end
In the end

And when they say thicker than water
And I say water's
And now you say you can not push me around
And you say you are the martyr
And I say
Than when you say, I keep on putting you out
And you're right

Someone who saw you, said you're well
Know what you'll say
I think I'll tell them wish you well
Wish you well
Guess who you know shields it all?
Loved you, not fun in the end
You'll live alone, you'll never know
The person that I really am

They say it's been too long
And I feel the same
