Waking up in cold shivers
I hear them shots ringing off outside
I hope it ain't one of my niggas
Cause tomorrow ain't promised
Got me paranoid mama
Waking up in cold shivers
Thank the Lord for the blessings
Got to keep it on the dresser
I can't trust niggas
Yeah, I do believe in karma
Bad dreams of the drama
I'm in cold shivers
Shots ringing off outside
I'm in cold cold cold cold shivers
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised

Uh, reminiscing, sipping missing all my dead homies
Mama tell me to keep my faith
I keep my 9 on me
Paying lawyers fighting cases on a daily basis
Baby mama out here fucking up my reputation
Hate that my kids are distant
Trying to be optimistic
Every since they murdered my homie I been so unforgiven
Shots through the nights are ringing
Cops and the lights are beaming
Mom on the corner screaming and she just can't believe it
Screaming "why did they have to take her son?"
Executed by a gun he was only 21, lord
The other day some niggas followed me home
My brother P was thinking murder
Lord I know he was wrong , fuck

Waking up in cold shivers
I hear them shots ringing off outside
I hope it ain't one of my niggas
Cause tomorrow ain't promised
Got me paranoid mama
Waking up in cold shivers
Thank the Lord for the blessings
Got to keep it on the dresser
I can't trust niggas
Yeah, I do believe in karma
Bad dreams of the drama
I'm in cold shivers
Shots ringing off outside
I'm in cold cold cold cold shivers
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised

Uh, suicide a take my life I can not visualize it
My homie seen his cousin shot up while his kids was watching
Pistol got a couple of bodies so they sanitize it
Niggas stretch you out on purpose call that exercising
God, let's not hide from the truth
What if someone took your daughter tell me what would you do?
Turn to channel 7 news they found her body in two
Evidence was never found killer still on the loose
Lord, pray for my mind please pray for my soul
I just gotta get high help me to cope with my lows
I done lost my daughter had to bury my granny
Just the thought of losing mama... scary

Waking up in cold shivers
I hear them shots ringing off outside
I hope it ain't one of my niggas
Cause tomorrow ain't promised
Got me paranoid mama
Waking up in cold shivers
Thank the Lord for the blessings
Got to keep it on the dresser
I can't trust niggas
Yeah, I do believe in karma
Bad dreams of the drama
I'm in cold shivers
Shots ringing off outside
I'm in cold cold cold cold shivers
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised
I said I'm paranoid mama cause tomorrow ain't promised

Shots ringing off outside
Cold cold cold cold shivers
