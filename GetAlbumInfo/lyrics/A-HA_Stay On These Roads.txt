The cold has a voice
It talks to me
Stillborn, by choice
It airs no need to hold

Old man feels the cold...
Oh baby don't
'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on...my love
We shall meet, I know
I know

Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
'Shadow your love...'
The voice trails off again

Old man feels the cold 
Oh baby don't
'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on...my love
You feel so weak, be strong
Stay on, stay on
We shall meet, I know
I know
I know, my love, I know

Feel the cold
Winter's calling on my home..
