Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall

We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall

Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall

Makin' love is so much sweeter
When you love the one you hold
After all these years of holdin' her
You'd think by now I'd know

Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
'Cause tonight I climbed the wall

Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall

Tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
