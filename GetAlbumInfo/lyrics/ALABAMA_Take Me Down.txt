Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your lovin' arms
And ev'rything's gonna be alright
You're the one who took my hand
When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can.

Take me down where I wanna be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight.

In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowin' bright
So keep the fires burnin'
And let it warm me through the night.
You can be a part of me
'Cause you're what love was meant to be
You and me, baby
We'll set this flame inside free.

Take me down where I wanna be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight.

You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together
Share another night in ecstasy
We know that it's feelin' better
Ev'ry time we get together
Maybe love was meant for you and me
Whoa.

Take me down where I wanna be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight.

Take me down tonight
Ooh oh, take me down tonight
Ooh oh, are you gonna take me, (take me)
Shake me, (shake me)
Take me down tonight.
Um hum
Take me, take me...
