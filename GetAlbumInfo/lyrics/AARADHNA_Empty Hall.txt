I should've known
That you'd break my heart again
It was my fault
Tried to believe you're a great man
I should've known
That with time your flaws would grow
Now there it goes
Eight years <i>[?]</i>

Empty hall
It's just an empty hall
All them pieces are with you
And I'm just left here with the blues

All my hopes
And all my pride left on the floor
Tear drops on the ground
And the cries go round and round
You should see me now
After taking your pictures down
Now it's just me
And this place that I have found

Empty hall
It's just an empty hall
All them pieces are with you
And I'm just left here with the blues
Oooh

Ain't nobody here (Nobody here)
Nobody but me (No one but me)
Ain't nobody here (Nobody here)
Nobody but me (No one but me)
Ain't nobody here (Nobody here)
Nobody but me (No one but me)
Ain't nobody here (Nobody here)

Empty hall
It's just an empty hall
All them pieces are with you
And I'm just left here with the blues

Empty hall
It's just an empty hall
Ain't nobody here but me
In between these broken walls

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh oooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh oooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh oooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh oooh
