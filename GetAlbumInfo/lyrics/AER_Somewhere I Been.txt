Somewhere I been
Itâs gunna be alright
Itâs gunna be alright
Just know she got real
She got the only thing I want

<i>[Carter:]</i>
She got the style, she got the habits
She got everything Iâd ever want plus magic
I know if she can roll then I can go with her flow
Not a concern if I burn
Seeing that Iâm earning a little while learning a little something bout the game
She donât care, she donât care
If I go home with another name that night
Damn thatâs right, she right there
Four Loko, barely toked though
She know my flow and what I wrote though
Her eyesâll open up that door, no key
No time to ride that whip solo
Gotta grab her heart
Put on my halo, get a little false
Just for the day yo, ride down Rodeo
Youâll be my angel, no need to stay home

<i>[Dave:]</i>
Put the pieces in the puzzle and youâll find
Just enough to help to keep you satisfied

<i>[Carter:]</i>
It may sound cliche but her smile can tell it all
I know ive chosen right when my highs begin to stall
And lies from our heads start to fall
The fighting is no wall
Sheâs safe with me even when were breaking the law

<i>[Dave:]</i>
Weâve been livinâ a lie
All I want is a try
A little love on the side gets me
Pullinâ over the ride
Drop the window and smile
She can tell me anything its me
