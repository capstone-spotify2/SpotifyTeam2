Afterburner, after burning out, 
There's a news alert in ??, 
And some poor kid who drowned. 
Operator, operating round, 
Could you take a chance in our romance, 
You did nothing about. 

Oooo ooo, 
Take it like a man and do without. 
Oooo ooo, 
It takes a century to figure out. 
Oooo ooo, 
Making like we know what its about. 
Oooo ooo, 
Talk about it. 

After burning out. 
After burning out. 
After burning out. 
Times when i've forgotten you're around. 

Ten years later, 
I can't believe its dead, 
What we lost you're in without it started coming round again. 
Space invader, 
Tried it on again, 
I thought your tapes alone and your face is gone, and they're never gonna end. 

Oooo ooo, 
Take it like a man and do without. 
Oooo ooo, 
It takes a century to figure out. 
Oooo ooo, 
Making like we know what its about. 
Oooo ooo, 
Talk about it, yeah! 

After burning out. 
After burning out. 
After burning out. 
Times when i've forgotten you're around. 

And I know this night, 
Is another place. 
It can take another day, 
So you don't look back again. 
(don't look... back!) 
Yeah! 

After burner, 
After burning out. 
After burner, 
After burning out. 

After burning out, 
Stay away, you're burning out. 
After burning out, 
Stay away, you're burning out. 
After burning out, 
Stay away, you're burning out. 
After burning out, 
Stay away, you're burning out.
