Can't wait for night to come
That's when the fun really begins
My band cools off when that day is done
And then I tuck myself in

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Let's all make memories
Precious and temporary
Of all the people I meet, 
I want to take it all with me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?]</body></html>

Jesus is waiting on me
Just as he always does
Something will be coming up
Just like it always does

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Why can't I? <i>[x6]</i>
