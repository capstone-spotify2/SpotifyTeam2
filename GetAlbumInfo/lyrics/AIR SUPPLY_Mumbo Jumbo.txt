It's a thousand miles from anywhere you know
Every direction brings you back here when you go
The lunatics the misfits the needy and the greed
The broken bits all made to fit, theirs nothing you will need

It's always hot the melting pot, a wagging tail and tongue
We never close the coffers, make an offer until one
The world is what we've made it and its better upside down
The fastest growing biggest little love it hate it town

So welcome to the chaos, a purely perfect mess
You can get away with anything as long as you confess
And make a big donation if you want to open doors
And rest assured that your reward will help to bend some laws

So won't you follow me we'll walk into the fire?
A new clean slate and you'll be born again
It's so much easier when everyone's a liar
All you need to think about is how much you would really like to spend

No it don't mean a thing it's Mumbo Jumbo
No sense to anything it's Mumbo Jumbo
Hey miss information it's Mumbo jumbo
Use your imagination, it's Mumbo Jumbo

You see all that information was funneled to M.J.
And suddenly it all made sense in a weird perverted way
Thank heaven for the Mumbo who came to sort it out
We needed someone from within so we could live without

And if you ask me, you know I'll take you higher
Up to the sky and you'll be born again
It's so much easier when everyone's a liar
All you need to think about is how much you would really like to spend

<i>[Repeat Chorus:]</i>

And if you ask me, you know I'll take you higher
Up to the sky and you'll be born again
It's so much easier when everyone's a liar
All you need to think about is how much you would really like to spend
