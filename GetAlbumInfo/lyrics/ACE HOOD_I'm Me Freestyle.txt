A say hello to mister cutthroat bodys on the damn flo
All about the cash flow like my money in bank rolls
These haters pissed they know I'm the shit like my asshole
And I'm from the city were fuckin snitches don't last long
And I'm in the city were u keep it real or get mashed on
Yes that be broward county I love it it's still home
If they don't like it a say fuckem still they walls gone
And to my city got to meet up with yo mans homes
For lot of dell pumping for browder be my damn zone
Feel that anyway with it you can get serviced like a cell phone
They got that coke it's brightest whitest like a snow cone
And I'm me give my all behind this microphone
I give my blood sweat in tears in till my casket closed
In tell then I'm a givem wat they askin for
Hope up out that newest shit louie kicks wavin makon six
See me with that square in I'll blow a kiss at yo ladys kid
Fuck the politics I am all the shit that I say I am
Yes I know I'm blessed am bonnies angel I'm heaven sent
That's word to mother mommy never see yo baby quit
And know matter how many blocks of haters yo youngin get
So f'em all I'm taking over let me in this bitch
It's buck buck bang it throw grenades wen I am in the mix

I'm climbing to the top and every one is like who is this tellem who the shit ace hood homie
And now I'm back I signed my deala for a couple m's
And I am next to be the best up in this southern limit
And I'm from the city were ther is no mister millionaires
And now I'm back I signed my deala for a couple m's
And I'm next to be the best up in this southern limit
And I'm next to be the best up in the southern limit
I'm from the city were there ain't know mister millionaires
That's why today I got my deal I cried a hundred tears
Cause once I got it promised momma that we out of here
My swag changed in I lit up like the city fair
I started doing interviews and photo shoots to death
These niggas seen it and they hollin bout this shit ain't fair
