Look at the morning sun, shining so brightly
Love is in the air, I don't care
Look at the smiling faces, 
Makes me know that no one can take your place, your place, your place

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now

All the skies are gray, now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this leave, oh no never never
Throwing up my hands, not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
I'm tired of being alone, bye
Still in love with you, now
Let's stay together, together
