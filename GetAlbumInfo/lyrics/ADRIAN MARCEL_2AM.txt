<i>[Bridge:]</i>
(It's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
I-I-I want it)
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
Right now!

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
I'm turnt up in this bitch
Drunk off that liquor
I can't trust these hoes
But you look so different girl
You... You got your girls, I got my niggas
So you... should tell yo girls to come fuck with us

<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i>
Come live in the fast lane
Bottles every night, whatever you like
Cause I do things
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side
Cause a nigga wanna act strange
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you
And I ain't just running game
I ain't running game

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
I-I-I want this girl
I know you're horny girl
I-I-I want it girl
I want it girl
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl

<i>[Sage The Gemini:]</i>
Neck frozen, wrist too
They ain't never seen a California igloo
My dude own a magazine for the issue
You better off tryna kick it like jiu-jitsu
It's 2AM and I'm tryna get in there
Say X marks the spot but your ex not in here
On my momma, I ain't for the drama
I'm from the Sev, no beef
We just get the commas

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Let's pull off in this whip
Full speed to my after-hours
Take a couple more sips
Girl you know I'll be good for hours
You, you say it's real and I can feel lonely- ah
You know the deal, we in the moment
