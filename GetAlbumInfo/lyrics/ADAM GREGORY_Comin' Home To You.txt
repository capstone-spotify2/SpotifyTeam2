drivin' down an open road
there's nothin' on the radio
the windshield wipers keeping time
I'm thinking back when you were mine
heavy feelin' in my soul
hopin' i won't lose control
but baby if i do
i'm comin' home to you
from arkansas to timbuctu
i'd never stop i'd go right through
forty days and forty nights
have rained down on my paradise
what am i suppose to do
give me strength to make it through
one more sleepless night
i'm comin' home to you

home fired chicken, banjo pickin'
singin' all of our favorite songs
everybody'd sing along with
front porch swingin'
just you lookin'
like a queen at the high school prom
where we danced all night long
the moon shone down like a big spotlight
and everything felt so right
when you said i love you too
now I'm comin' home to you

well the rain drops falling
drive my heal
and I've got both hands on the wheel
that picture of you in my mind
it's got me burnin' up inside
lord please help me find my way
to find those magic words to say
and baby when i do
I'm comin' home to you

home fired chicken, banjo pickin'
singin' all of our favorite songs
everybody'd sing along with
front porch swingin'
just you lookin'
like a queen at the high school prom
where we danced all night long
the moon shone down like a big
spotlight
and everything felt so right
when you said i love you too
now i'm comin' home to you

sweet sun is rising
I'm getting close to home
it seems like I've been driving for so
long
gonna have some...
