I donât know
I donât know
I donât know
I donât know...

I thought that if I gave this world my heart 
It would show
Still I donât know
Still I donât know
People say Iâm moving too fast
Moving too slow
Youâre just too young
Youâre just too old
But theyâre just like me
They donât know

I donât know (where do we go)
I donât know (where do we go)
I donât know (what do you know)
I donât know (what do you know)

Iâm choosing visions that work for my reasons
But still,
I donât know 
I donât know 

People say Iâm moving too fast
Moving too slow
Youâre just too young
Youâre just too old
But theyâre just like me
They donât know 

I donât know (where do we go)
I donât know (where do we go)
I donât know (what do you know)
I donât know (what do you know)
