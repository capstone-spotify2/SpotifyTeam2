Train whistle blowin' around the bend
But I can hear it comin' in
That's the train my baby's on
But now she's gonna bring her home

Got a letter yesterday
This is what she had to say
Meet me at the station a quarter to ten
Let's try it over again

Waitin' at the station happy as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My lonely nights are over from this day on
Since my baby's coming back home

The train pulled in a few minutes late
But I didn't mind that little wait
That train is carrying medicine for heartaches and pain
For this lonely man

Everybody's gettin' off one by one
Tellin' their friend where they've been and what they've done
But where is my girl, everybody's off the train
She made a fool of me again

Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby, now
My nights will still be lonely on and on
Since my baby didn't come home

Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home

Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home
