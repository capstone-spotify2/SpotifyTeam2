Ahh let's go honky tonkin' 
Let's go honky tonkin' 
Have a honky tonkin' good time with us 
Ahh let's go honky tonkin' 
Let's go honky tonkin' 
Honky tonkin' round Texas 

Well I'll put some diesel in the tank 
Give that old Detroit a crank 
We'll sit back and let that silver eagle fly 
Well up and down that Lonestar State 
Let's have a honky tonkin' tail gate 
And don't forget to kiss your baby good bye 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Stick out a thumb and bum a ride 
Hitch-hike across the country side 
Come see why they call this place God's country 
Well criss-cross in the Colorado  
From Amarillo to Zapata 
Every town along the way from A to Z 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Well my mom called me up 
And she gave me my last warning 
Said there'll be hell to pay 
If I miss church this Sunday morning
