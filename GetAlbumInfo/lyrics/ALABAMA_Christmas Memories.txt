There's a blanket of snow
Coverin' up the old road
To the house where I was raised
Through the window I see
The lights on the tree
And a glow from the old fireplace
Though it all looks the same
So much as changed
From the way it used to be

Christmas memories of happy years gone by
They come back to me and keep me warm inside
Still those Christmas memories make me cry

Now the stockings are filled;
The house is still and the kids are dreamin' away
There's that old easy chair,
Me and Daddy sat there waitin' for Santa's sleigh
Now Daddy has gone but we'll carry on
'Cause the little ones will need

Christmas memories of happy years gone by
They come back to me and keep me warm inside
Good ole Christmas Memories
Oh, they mean so much to me
Oh, Those Christmas memories, make me cry...
