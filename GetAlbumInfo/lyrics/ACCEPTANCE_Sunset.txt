She's a saint
She's everything, she's everything I ain't
She's a saint
She comes this way and I've got no complaints

All this time I've wasted on you
I can't take this game you run me through

I'll play along
But I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm into what she's got
She's the spark that I'm chasing
She gives that love that I'm missing

She looks at me with a wicked smile
I look to her, I'm gonna stay awhile
(Come come, come over, come come, come over)
Caught off guard, breathing hard
Feel it beat through my heart
(Come come, come over, come come, come over)

All this time I've wasted on you
I won't be the one you fall into

I'll play along
But I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm into what she's got
She's the spark that I'm chasing
She gives that love that I'm missing

She's a saint
She's everything I ain't
She's a saint
I've got no complaints

I'll play along
But I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm into what she's got
She's the spark that I'm chasing
She gives that love that I'm missing

I'll play along (All this time I've wasted on you)
But I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm so tired of what I'm getting
I'm into what she's got (I can't take this game you run me through)
She's the spark that I'm chasing
She gives that love that I'm missing

All this time I've wasted on you
