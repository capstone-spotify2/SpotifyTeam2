Here's to a long, hot summer with the top down
And here's to taking over every beach town
I want an ice cream, love is such a sweet thing
After midnight, we'll go skinny dipping

Oh-oh, this party is a go-go
Gonna steal the show
And I really like it
Baby, know you drive me crazy
And this sweet's got me hazy and I really like it

Yeah, I really like it
Gonna lose control
Yeah, I really like it
When we rock-n-roll
Yeah, I really like it
Hey, come on, let's go
I really like it, I, I really like it, like it

We're drinking vodka out of blue and red cups
And singing Prince songs while we're getting fucked up

Oh-oh, this party is a go-go
Gonna steal the show
And I really like it
Baby, know you drive me crazy
And this sweet's got me hazy and I really like it

Yeah, I really like it
Gonna lose control
Yeah, I really like it
When we rock-n-roll
Yeah, I really like it
Hey, come on, let's go
I really like it, I, I really like it, like it

Hey, I really like it
I, I really like it
Hey, I really like it
I, I really like it

Yeah, I really like it
Gonna lose control
Yeah, I really like it
When we rock-n-roll
Yeah, I really like it
Hey, come on, let's go
I really like it, I, I really like it, like it

Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I really like it, I, I really like it, like it
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I really like it, I, I really like it, like it
