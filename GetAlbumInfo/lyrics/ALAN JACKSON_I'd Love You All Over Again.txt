Has it been ten years
Since we said "I do"
I've always heard marriage 
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better 
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

The preacher man said 
"Til death do us part"
That seemed like forever 
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And if I had it to do all over
I'd still do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

If tomorrow I found 
One more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again...
