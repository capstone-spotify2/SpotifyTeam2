(I set) I set (my friends) my friends on fire (fire) 
well I looked at your grave I do not feel alive
(I set) I set (my friends) my friends on fire (fire) 
well I looked at your eyes I do not feel alive. 
I set (I set) my friends (my friends) on fire,
now I will give up
(I set) I set (my friends) my friends (fire) on fire,
now I will give my life.

If I tell you now I will not feel alive,
If I kill you now I will not feel pride,
If I kill you now I have set those fields on fire,
what's this? One More Time.
Burn-Lies-Lies-one more time,
Burn-Lies-Lies-set, one more time

Yaaaaa, yaaaaaa, well I gave one more time,
Yaaaaa, yaaaaaa, well I gave one more time now,

"The sun came through the leaves and lit them 
up like it was on fire, right at sunset"
Let's look the world into the eyes (like it was on fire) 
and say just one more time (like it was on fire), much less.
Let's look the world into the eyes (like it was on fire) 
and say just one more time, one more time.
One more time!
Yeah, one more
Yeah, one more time
One more life when I pray it's time.
When I gave one more time, 
to lie into the after life, 
One more time. I praise one more lie.
