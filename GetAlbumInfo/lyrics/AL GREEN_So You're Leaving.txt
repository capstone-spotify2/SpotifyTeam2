So you're leaving me today
Just because of what they say
You took their word against mine
Friends do lie some time

Before you walk out the door
Let me say just once more
They don't want you for me
Open your eyes, can't you see

So you're leavin' me
Hey, baby
Don't want you to leave me
Yeah, baby

Tell me,
I'm trying to find a way 
That I can make you stay
You won't hear a word I say
And you wanna leave me anyway

Girl, don't break our hearts
I knew right from the start
If they lied on Jesus, can't you see
They'll lie on you and me

Are you leavin' me?
Hey, baby
Are you leavin' me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna say
My darlin', take my life
You can stay and be my wife
You just deal like mine
And our hearts beat right on time

So, go on, don't break our hearts
I knew from the start
If they lie on Jesus, can't you see
They'll lie on you and me

Are you leavin' me?
I don't wanna...
Are you leavin' me?
Hey, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I wanna know
Are you leavin' me?
Why don't ya c'mon back, babe
Makes no sense in leavin' me
Hey baby

I want to be your leadin' man
Are you wanna go?
Are you wanna go?
Are you leavin' me?
Hey baby
I wanna know who you love
Baby, who you love,
I wanna know who you love
Are you leavin'?
Wanna know, are you leavin' me?
Why you, why you, why you wanna go?  
Don't know, Hey baby
Whoo
Why you wanna go, I wanna know
Why you wanna go?
Tell me, tell me
Who you love
Who you love
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
