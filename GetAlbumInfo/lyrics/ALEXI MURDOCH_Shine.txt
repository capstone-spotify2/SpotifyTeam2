I wonder why 
We are the way we are 
Yes I wonder why 
We are the way we are 
And why 
We only love each from afar 

This is how we are fading 
This is how we are fading 
Time 
Time 

You spend your days 
Watching the door 
Yeah you spend your whole life waiting 
But you don't know what for 
You have everything you need right here 
Still you want more 

Oh this is how we are fading 
This is how we are fading 
Time 
Time 

Well I didn't come here 
Looking for a soul 
And I'm tired of watching dust 
Collecting on a bowl 
I'm a spirit trying to be human 
I'm just a spirit trying to be human 

But I'm thinking this is how we are fading 
This is how we are fading
Time 
Time 

You hold on to yourself 
You're afraid that you might 
Get left behind 

And so you hide your eyes 
You're afraid that the light 
Will make you blind 

But it's time 
It's time to shine 

Yes it's time to believe in what you know 
Time to believe in what you know 
Time to believe in what you know 
And you don't need strength to be strong 
Time to believe in what you know 
No you don't need strength to be strong 
Time to believe in what you know 
Time to believe in what you know 
Time to believe in what you know 
time to believe in what you know 

Time to believe before you go
