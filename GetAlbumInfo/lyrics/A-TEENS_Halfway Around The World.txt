Baby I will soon be leaving 
and I know that you are feeling down 
But every week I'll send a letter 
To let you know my love will never change 
I promise you I always feel the same 

So remember in your heart 
Baby when we are apart 
There's no need for crying 
Cuz even if I am

Halfway around the world 
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world 
Still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Cuz I'm gonna miss you like crazy
Even if I'm halfway around the world

Baby when the miles are growing
You and I will still be growing strong
No matter what your friends are saying
Don't give up on what you're waiting for
Cuz one day I'll be knocking on your door 

So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There's no need for crying 
Cuz even if I am

Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
Still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Cuz I'm gonna miss you like crazy
Even if I'm halfway around the world

If I could you know that I would find a way 
To stay for good but I must go now
I wanna hold you baby
I'm gonna miss you like crazy even if I'm...
