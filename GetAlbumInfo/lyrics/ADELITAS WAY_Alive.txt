What if I told you that I think you're perfect?
Beautiful sky in your eyes, it's so worth it.
I know you make me feel alive.

What if I told you that I'm in forever?
Nothing to hide, yeah, I'll go wherever you go.
You make me feel alive.

And I'll be hanging on every word you say to me.
Hanging on a feeling that I get,
Cause you make me

Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time it's something new.
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time.
And I feel alive when I'm with you.
Deep inside it's something true.
You're the only reason I fight,
You're the best thing in my life.

What if I told you that I'd never hurt you?
Always be there for you to hold on to.
I know you make me feel alive

And every single second's a lifetime memory,
I'll be holding on to each moment
'Cause you make me

Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

And I feel alive when I'm with you.
When I'm with you

<i>[Chorus]</i>
