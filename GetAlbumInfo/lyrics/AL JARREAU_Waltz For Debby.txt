In her own sweet world
Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear
Lives my favorite girl.
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown-ups all wear.
In the sun she dances
To silent music-songs
That are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head
Then one day all too soon
She'll grow up &amp; she'll leave her doll
And her prince &amp; her silly old bear.
When she goes they will cry
As they whisper good-bye
They will miss her I know
but then so will I.

Earrings made of shoestrings
Barbie dolls with blue jeans
Makin' cross eyes
Shakes me when I'm sleepin'
Did you ever see
A kitten with an apron on
Stop 'n start his stereo
When she knows her brothers down the hall runnin' 'round and skippin' 'round
Because she's so,
She's so inspired
Then she's tired
Please put me jammies on
Daddy look at the rain
Can I go and play in the rain

In the sun she dances
To silent music-songs
That are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head
Then one day all too soon
She'll grow up &amp; she'll leave her doll
And her prince &amp; her silly old bear
When she goes they will cry
As they whisper good-bye
They will miss her I know
But then so will I.
