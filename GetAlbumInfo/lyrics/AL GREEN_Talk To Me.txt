Talk to me talk to me
Darling I love the things you say
Talk to me baby talk to me
In your own sweet gentle way

Let me hear baby tell me dear
Tell me you love me so
Talk to me baby talk to me
Tell me why I got to know
The many ways you speak of love
I heard it all before
And it sounds so good so good so good
Please play the part that I know
While I am so glad you were to mine

Oh talk to me baby
Darling I love the things you say
Ooh I love you baby
Talk to me baby
Darling I love the things you say
Oh talk to me my baby talk to me
In your own sweet gentle way
Baby baby
Say something good to me
Baby just
