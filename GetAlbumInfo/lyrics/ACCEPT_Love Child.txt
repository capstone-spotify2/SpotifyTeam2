Everyone is telling me that he was born as a love child
By looking in his eyes something turned me lose in his hot
nights
Feeling the power of lost when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
I can feel your sex winding up the girl in the red dress
And my brain is gone, what is going on, I'm burning inside
Feeling the power of lost when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild a love child
A love child, running wild a love child - love child
I gotta tell myself that he was born as a love child
And the story of his way should not make me stay in the hot
night
Feeling the power of lost when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild a love child
A love child, running wild a love child - love child
Don't know what I am
A woman or a man
Many troubles behind me
I'm doing all I can
But I'm what I am
Leave me alone - don't mistreat me
Feeling the power of lost when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild a love child
