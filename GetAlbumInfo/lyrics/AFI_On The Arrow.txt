He said, "Who truly belongs here?"
Not I she said, I'll lie here with you
He knows no one shines forever
They change with the weather

He said, "I've now stayed too long here"
Good bye she said, I'll wait here for you
He knows the winds carry sorrow
As they leave she'll follow
They leave tomorrow

Fragments of joy torn apart
A freshly drained heart that beats
Disguise themselves through him
He'll say that it's nothing new
And swear this is true,
for you, I'll swallow the ocean

I'll swallow the ocean

He said, "Who truly belongs here?"
Not I she said, I'll lie here to you
I know the sorrow is sacred
And I'll never break you
I'll softly save you

Fragments of joy torn apart
A freshly drained heart that beats
Disguise themselves through him
He'll say that it's nothing new
And swear this is true,
for you, I'll swallow the ocean

I'll swallow the ocean
