It's like a diamond ring
It's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song 
That we love to sing
Every time we hear the music

We're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

Its like a rainy night in candlelight
And,ooh it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working
out so right
And it's just the way we planned it

Tell ya
We're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Don't you know
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

We're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time
