I never thought that I would be that one
The only one, to take that gun
You know I was the better one
The better one
And in this place the choice I make
To fight this way
The colors fade and leave no trace
Cause you can't change, cause you can't, change

The silence is your action
When thereâs a crash waiting to happen
But you still show no reaction...

Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, the enemy

I'd rather hate, than be the one
Who pricks his thumb, to see his blood
I'm not that strong
I never was

The silence is your action
When thereâs a crash waiting to happen
But you still show no reaction...

Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, the enemy

I won't come back, if you don't fight back
I won't come back, if you don't fight back

Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, my enemy
Please be my enemy, the enemy
