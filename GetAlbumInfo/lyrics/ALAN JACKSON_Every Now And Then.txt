The love you thought was dead and gone
Somehow keeps on hanging on
Even when your heart has left it far behind
Just when you have turned the page
It seems to find a way
There it is again
Every now and then

<i>[Chorus]</i>
And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
Every now and then

You can finally breathe life in 
Without wondering where she's been
Go to sleep at night without her on your mind
In a second it appears
Followed by familiar tears
Like a long lost friend
Every now and then

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

And I know it's all for nothing
There's no going back to way back then

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I still love you
Every now and then
