We are here to find what we can't hold and hope
If we wanted love wed be alone

Tonight's the night

Here comes trouble
Through the struggle we will fly
Here comes trouble
Tonight's the night

Tonight's the night

We'll be unstoppable hear us
(We will not) we will not be swayed
(We are) we are the impossible dreamers
(We got what) we got what it takes
(Tonight) tonight the army is marching
(To make sure) to make sure we count
(We fight) coz every fight that's worth fighting
(Will end in) will end in a shout!

Here comes trouble
Through the struggle we will fly
Here comes trouble
Tonight's the night

Tonight's the night

We care more about ourselves than anyone
Nobody will hand us a place in the sun
Even when we fail we hold our heads up high
We cannot regret a thing we try

We'll be unstoppable hear us
(We will not) we will not be swayed
(We are) we are the impossible dreamers
(We got what) we got what it takes
(Tonight) tonight the army is marching
(To make sure) to make sure we count
(We fight) coz every fight that's worth fighting
(Will end in) will end in a shout!

Here comes trouble
Through the struggle we will fly
Here comes trouble
Tonight's the night

We'll be unstoppable hear us
(We will not) we will not be swayed
(We are) we are the impossible dreamers
(We got what) we got what it takes
(Tonight) tonight the army is marching
(To make sure) to make sure we count
(We fight) coz every fight that's worth fighting
(Will end in) will end in a shout!

We'll be unstoppable hear us
(We will not) we will not be swayed
(We are) we are the impossible dreamers
(We got what) we got what it takes
