No more drama 
I'm going under 
With your face so full of thunder 
Lay it on me Evidently 
There's an elephant in the room 

Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 

You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 

When it comes down 
To the wire 
One spark can start a fire 
So come on now 
Let it all out 
Before my heart goes tick tick boom 

Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 

Think about how eleven letters 
Mean the world when they're put together 
They can change our lives forever 
Say them now cause it's now or never

You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 

You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 

I forgive you (ahhhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life
I forgive you <i>[2x]</i> (ahhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life...
