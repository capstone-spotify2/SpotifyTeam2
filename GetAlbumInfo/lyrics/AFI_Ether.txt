Wear your tears tonight my dear.
I'd say they truly suit you,
unimpressed and moistly dressed.
I may decide to keep you.

I open my mouth
and drink down the sea.
You'd drown in me.
If savior sleep
would cease to evade.

I'd dream it all away.
I'm caught in the fall,
when I'm awake.
I'd cede my soul to take.
I'm no one at all
and nothing's changed at all.

I open my eyes
To lovers in flames
Praying
sleep will provide
us a cool escape

I'd dream it all away.
I'm caught in the fall,
when I'm awake.
I'd cede my soul to take.
I'm no one at all
and nothing's changed at all.

I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my...

I'd dream it all away.
I'm caught in the fall,
when I'm awake.
I'd cede my soul to take.
I'm no one at all
and nothing's changed at all.
At all.
