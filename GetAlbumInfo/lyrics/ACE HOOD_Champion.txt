Ace Hoooood!

<i>[Jazmine Sullivan:]</i>
People said I wouldn't make it (make it)
That I'd never get to the top
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop
So I had to keep pushing (pushing)
Through the pain and the tears
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here

That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
That's why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Coming up I use to watch TV
Look up at the screen
Then look at my mama
Tell her ma that's gon' be me
She said son you gon' be great
I knew it from the start
Your daddy was a poet
That's how he captured my heart
It's in my blood, you ask me why I keep it real
Like <i>[? ]</i> asking how a nigga feel
Imagine how it feels
Waking up to nothing is enough to give you chills
Waking up to nothing is enough to make you kill
Enough to bring your daughter on a heist, it's unreal
You said you gotta song living life unreal
That's why I put my life in every song I kill
Sing it girl

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
That's why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
I had a job too niggas, so what?
You haters make me laugh, how you hatin so much
Go head and do the math
Watch the numbers add up
Picture me and Khaled rollin to the grammys smashed up
Keep running to The Runners when it's time to make a (beat)
I'm gunning at you suckas who ain't try'na feel this sh**
My ambitons as a rider blastin' out a niggas whip
Throwing up a peace sign to all my hustlas on the strip
Top down in the chevy yea you know I keep it pimpin
And my pistol heavy niggas know that ain't slippin
Know that I'm on the grind niggas know that ain't slippin'
My faith is on the line so you know I ain't slippin'
You trippin' and that's why

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong this the song of a champion (champion)
That's why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

(Let's break it down for em...)
Ladies put your hands up high
(Came too far now to give up)
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
(It don't even matter say what you want)
Fellas put your hands up in the sky
(Nothing you could say that'll make me stop)
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
(I'm a keep going till I reach the top, and that's why)

<i>[Rick Ross:]</i>
Definitely livin' the life
I gravitated to the light
I sacrIficed a decade
Now it's times every night
Let them suckas' spectate
'Cause shorty I expect that
We still touching big weight
And surely I invest that
Break it down the best way
'Cause I know how to stretch that
Haters talking sideways
And I could never stress that
Ready for the war though
I would never compromise
Mami call me Gordo
You shine like summer time

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong this the song of a champion
(I'm a champion and that's why)
That's why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

People said I wouldn't make it (make it)
That I'd never get to the top
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop
So I had to keep pushing (pushing)
Through the pain and the tears
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here
