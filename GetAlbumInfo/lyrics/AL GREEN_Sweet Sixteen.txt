You get up early in the morning just to see her eyes
She's walking 'round the house in a complete disguise
I don't know just how to tell you, just how she changed so fast
But she's the prettiest thing in my life at last

I'm <i>[?]</i> a silver moon, baby
I can't stand to see you in my bedroom
I'm moving with
And I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

I can't believe the way you hold me
I can't believe the way you console me
Oh, I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

Oh, the fellows wanna just touch her or hold her hand real tight
But she is the prettiest thing out here tonight, gentlemen
If the dancing gets good to you, lay down in your shawl
You try to move your body, you might lose control, tell you one thing

I don't believe the way you hold me
The way you console me
Oh God, I wanna dance with
My sweet love sixteen, alright

Tell you what I'll do, just talk with
Tell what I'll do unless you walk with
I believe I'll let ya sing baby
I don't want you to hold me
