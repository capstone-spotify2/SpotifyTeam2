Guess who's back up in the mix, with my big black shades, read my big black lips
The night is still young like a nine year old kid
Finna hit the Dale's Liqour, and cop another fifth
Of Hennessy, for my personal pleasure
A took a sip, a little head dripped, so I wipe my lip
Luckily it didn't spill on my tee, I'm well-known for that
But the bitches still holla
'Till they go whores, like Kentucky Derby
The power in the Porsche, all I need is to kick back
So I can just chill like a six-pack, of coors, of course
As soon as I walk up in the door I'm yelling out

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Somebody spike my Sprite
So I can feel larger then life
I call this House Party 5
What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
I call this House Party 5

Yo my party don't stopping up I hit 'em up
I said wuddup, I said wuddup, he said (not much you)
You know what I'm 'bout, what's going down for the night
(Party at Ashback house), I said what
He said (yup), shit y'all be fucked up
Stepping out, like an accident, roof level
Outta elevator in a skyscraper in the clouds
I hung up, ran to the bathroom to clean my Air One's up
I would rock the Timb boots but they all scuffed up
I looked in the mirror, seen my swag was up
Don't play swag out, so I had to adjust
Fast forward, I seen so many cars pulling up
Hoes pulling down they skirts, niggas with
"We can't lose" on they shirts, you would assume they take it to the dirt
Some of my niggas real killers, put you down to Earth
And they down to Earth, and we Chris Rock
The party like it don't stopping up

<i>[Hook]</i>

And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, and the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up
Now put your hands up in the air
If you tryna put it in the air
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got homies 2 stepping to the right of me
We got Hennessy, got Nuvo to spare
If you trying to go, we can take you there
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got the homies 2 stepping to the right of me

Yeah, another round on me
Look at this women move her booty around on me
It's 2:15 in the morning but we up
Finna hit the Dennies, tell 'em hook a scrambled up
Pissy drunk if you didn't know my nigga, no my nigga
Higher then a spirits, of the un-living
In the mist of everybody fucking up the homies house
Think B.I.'s party and bullshit, a fight broke out

<i>[Hook]</i>

And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up
