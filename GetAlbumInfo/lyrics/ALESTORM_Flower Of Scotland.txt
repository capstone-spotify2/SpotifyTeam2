O Flower of Scotland - When will we see
Yer like again - That fought and died for
Yer wee bit Hill and Glen - And stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

The Hills are bare now - Autumn leaves lie
lie thick and still - O'er land that is lost now
Which those so dearly held - That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

Those days are past now - And in the past
they must remain - But we can still rise now
And be the nation again - That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

O Flower of Scotland - When will we see
Yer like again - That fought and died for
Yer wee bit Hill and Glen - And stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again
