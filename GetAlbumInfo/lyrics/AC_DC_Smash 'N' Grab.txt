Come on and blow your mind
You're out of time
Beat your chest
Join in like all the rest

Shove 'em back
Hey hey hey yes
Hey hey hey yeah

Seems like you run a mile
Hey try to unwind
Come on let's blow your mind
It's no use
You ain't got time

Without a sound
Come on let's get around
Oh I hear the crash
Come on in and just
Smash, grab and take it
While you can
Smash, grab and take it
Hey hey hey yeah

Why don't you come out
Come on - run it to the ground
You're gonna blow your mind
You're gonna pulverize

Once you've come up late
You gotta pick up straight
It's gonna blow your mind
And all the living's gone

Smash, grab and take it
Take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
Take it take it take it yeah

Steal the money
I'm taking while I can
Come on let's blow your mind
Hey hey hey yeah

Shoot 'em right down
Take it while you can
Come on let's blow your mind

Smash, grab, take it
Hey hey hey yeah
Smash, grab and take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
