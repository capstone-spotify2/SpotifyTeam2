You can hang me by the neck
Till I'm dead, dead, dead
Kiss my mouth until it's red, red, red
Now is the time honey, this is the place
The good and the bad guy face to face
Blood pressure up, sunlight down
Toughen up, toughen up, play tough.
Johnny can't program, sure enough
Put a leather in your cap, play tough
Sugar-boom, sugar-boom, that's the stuff
Comb your hair play tough
No zap.
You can hang me by the neck
Till I'm dead, dead, dead
Kiss my mouth until it's red, red, red
Don't play, don't sing, I don't hike
But me no buts buddy, riding my bike
Surf coming up Geronimo Joe
Toughen up, toughen up, let's go.
You can hang me by the neck
Till I'm dead, dead, dead
Kiss my mouth until it's red, red, red
Don't be a dunco, forget charts
Out of the wallet, into your hearts
Where it counts, in large amounts
Toughen up, toughen up, let's pounce.
