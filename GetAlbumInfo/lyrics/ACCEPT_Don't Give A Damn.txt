I ain't gonna be damned no more
If I'm standing my ground
There's times when I got no style
Just hanging around

But don't take it for granted
That you're so cool with me
Next time you leave this room
You better slam that door

'Cause I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn - what you think of me
I don't give a damn - what you think of me

Don'r you ever come back to me
'Cause you're sure bad luck
You ain't nothing but truble
You never gave ... just took

That's why I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn

I don't give a damn - what you think of me
I don't give a damn - what you think of me
