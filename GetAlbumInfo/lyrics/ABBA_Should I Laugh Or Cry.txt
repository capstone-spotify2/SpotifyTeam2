He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

He's (he's) dressed (dressed) in the striped pajamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives (gives) me (me) of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

Strange (strange) how (how) dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No (no) more (more) pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry
