We grow and fertilize the semen of hate
Ignoring our ignorance - daring our fate
Predictions were made - generations were lost
While the seed is growing day by day in front of us

We buried tolerance and our respect
Became a breeding ground for social dismay
Whatever happened to the love-generation
With black and white hand in hand side by side

So preacher don't you preach
Hey teacher don't you teach

Prejudice - stop the hate
No more prejudice - I ain't losing my faith
Prejudice - stop the hate
No more prejudice - I ain't losing my faith
If we could manage just to get along
Instead of blaming each other for what's going wrong
Education is the secret - the future's in our hands
Burn the fields of hate and believe again

Teacher don't you teach
Preacher don't you preach
So teacher don't you teach me
Hey preacher don't you preach

Prejudice - stop the hate
No more prejudice - I ain't losing my faith
Prejudice - stop the hate
No more prejudice - I ain't losing my faith
Prejudice - prejudice

Judging one another by the colour of skin
Carefully covering our feelings within
We solve our problems with a kick in the face
We're living in a world judged by colour and race

So preacher don't you preach
Hey teacher don't you teach me
