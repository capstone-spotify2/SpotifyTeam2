<i>[Japanese bonus track]</i>

These are the days...
The days and the times taken for granted
So many faces but still we're alone
Living the life, so many souls can only dream of
Here we are well, but still we want more

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
The spin of the wheel
The luck of the draw
The bounty we hold in our hands... in our hands
Seems never enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(Ride on history)
Can our yesterday save our tomorrow?
(Ride on liberty)
Or are we lost in the land of the free
(Ride on history)
Are we thriving on hardship and sorrow
(Ride on liberty)
Seems we're lost in the land of the free... of the free

Take to the streets
Shining a light on the forgotten
Carrying the torch to the lands of the lost

The hungry, the poor
They scratch and they scrape
Surviving on nothing
While we toss away
For no need ever known

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
The spin of the wheel
The luck of the draw
The bounty we hold in our hands... in our hands
Seems never enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(Ride on history)
Can our yesterday save our tomorrow
(Ride on liberty)
Or are we lost in the land of the free
(Ride on history)
Are we thriving on hardship and sorrows
(Ride on liberty)
Seems we're lost in the land of the free

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
Yeah, the spin of the wheel
The luck of the draw
The bounty we hold in our hands... in our hands
It's never enough

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
(Ride on history)
Will our yesterday save our tomorrow
(Ride on liberty)
Or are we lost in the land of the free
(Ride on history)
Will we pay back all that we borrowed?
(Ride on liberty)
Are we lost in the land of the free?

Land of the free
Lost in the land of the free
