No one said it would be easy
You once could call this place your own
It took a single day,
It seems like your whole life has changed around
But one thing I know

So oh,
Nobody can take your life away
No,
No one is standing in your place
It's your time,
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be

Maybe things can turn for better
Maybe your dreams will come true
The future seems unclear,
But if you let me hold the mirror
I'll shine back the best of you

So oh,
Nobody can take your life away
No,
No one is standing in your place
It's your time,
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be

Try to see the world getting bigger
We both have our roads and much farther to go
But it won't have to feel so hard when you're not alone
(Nobody can take your life away)

(Nobody can take your life away)

Oh,
Nobody can take your life away
No,
No one is standing in your place
It's your time,
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be
Way it's gonna be
