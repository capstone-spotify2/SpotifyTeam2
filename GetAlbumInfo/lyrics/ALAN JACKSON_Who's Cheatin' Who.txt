Everywhere you look
You can write a book
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand

But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
Who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door

I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind

But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
Who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

A heart is on the line
Each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
It keeps goin' on
As long as you keep in outta sight

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door
