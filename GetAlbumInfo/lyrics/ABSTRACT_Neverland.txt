There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely."
And ever since that day...

In these fast times, chasing life lines for a life time
I've had my heart in the right place at the wrong time
With the right girl in another world
Maybe we would be together still
If you hear this and resent that
I don't give a shit I'll let it spill
I don't give a damn I'll keep it real
Cause by now I hope you know the drill
I would never lie, young forever
I ain't ever gonna die, told me grow up but I went and showed 'em why
I could make it I
Showed 'em the power in youth
Power in truth
The younger you stay the closer you are to your roots
That's the reason I do
I can teach how to hit the skies
Rise above 'em without getting high
But if it help a bit, take a lil' hit, take a lil' sip, put your mind at ease
Swear you got the keys, you can have your dreams, that's up to you not what others believe
Geez
I swear that's the part that took longest for me
Cause when I drop into a beat
I detach from the world view it under my feet
Orbit around with my dreams and there I perceive my reality and what it means
Music is where I can breathe, a world in between
What I am, what I was, what I will be
It's the only place that I feel free, hope you feel me

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy," they say to me
Away from all of reality
And He said

Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely <i>[x3]</i>
And ever since that day...

You ain't ever gotta be alone
I found company inside a song
Take it off your chest throw it in a poem
If they try to flex show 'em where you going
Hating on your past, kill 'em with your moment
When you get the chance drive it like you stole it
She said I don't want to grow up
I gotta go keep my passions alive
Please say you've heard of a place I can fly
Where nothing's impossible, that's where I gotta go
They said the only way up was to get in line
I'm tellin you that somebody lied
As someone who's been to the otherside
Blurring the lines between earth and mind
She's a lost girl in a lost world but I know what she's tryna find
Some call it music
I call it never land
Where we can take flight and don't have to ever land
You can stay young forever if you follow your heart
Know a 9-5 tear the soul apart
Keep it safe you can keep your soul in art
We can't live a lie, we would rather die, if I don't live for this I am not alive
I don't deserve the breathe, I don't deserve the steps, don't deserve the criticism or compliments
This is who I am, this is what I do
Outside of never land I don't have a clue
They call us lost but this is the place where I was found
Take my hand Wendy we're home now

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free <i>[x2]</i>
