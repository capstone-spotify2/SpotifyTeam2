Well, Sarah's only 10
And she's attracted to older men
And they seem to like her back but she's intelligent
And Billy's a football star
He drives around in his muscle car
But he really really wants to be a ballerina

And he wonders who am I?
Who am I?
And he wants to be a man
But he doesn't understand
It's alright to be what he wants

I'm calling all superstar wonderful weirdos
Can you hear me call tonight?
I know you're alone in your world, full of fear though
But the more you run, the harder it is to hide
Oh, yeah, yeah

Well, Johnny studies rockets
With his plastic protected pockets
So his pens don't leak out upon the floor
Where Jenny's rolling
And she's scared of growing
Cause she is 5 feet taller than the girl next door

And she wonders who am I?
What the hell am I?
And she's got a lot to offer
But she doesn't look like Cindy Crawford
And it makes her cry

I'm calling all superstar wonderful weirdos
Can you hear me call tonight?
I know you're alone in your world, full of fear though
But the more you run, the harder it is to hide

It's a total rejection of the system
It's the honest opinion for the very first time
It's a different perception of living
And it's time that we opened our minds

I'm calling all superstar wonderful weirdos
You're not alone tonight
No you're not alone in your world, full of fear though
But the more you run, the harder it is to hide

Can you hear me?
