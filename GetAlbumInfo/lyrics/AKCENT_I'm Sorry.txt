With eyes wide open
A new life hope
I just realize it was no surprise
My heart is broken you got me open
It will heal in time I will be just fine
I'm getting stronger, I'm hurt no longer

My choice is right now
I'll take it somehow

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah
And I Said com'on ask me, come on ask me

My life is better it doesnt matter

'Cause I feel so free you're a memory
I will love again 'cause I have a plan
I'll find a girl that's right by the end of the night
I'm getting stronger, I'm hurt no longer

My choice is right now
I'll take it somehow

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry
Yalla Bina Yalla We eel Insha' Allah
And I Said com'on ask me, come on ask me

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah
And I Said com'on ask me, come on ask me
