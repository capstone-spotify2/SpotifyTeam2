They say every sin will have a thousand eyes
To guilty fools with guilty minds
But I most be cruel to be kind
Deep within a my head of stone
Could I be - of stone - could I be - of stone - could I be

Oh how the birds forget to sing
Do they know where I have been?
Oh how I will leave you there again
Deep within my head of stone
Could I be - of stone - could I be - of stone - could I be

You are my only one
You are my only one
You are my lonely one
You are my only one

Oh for the trees did grow there, and the plants did spring
Oh for they know a lovers sin
Ainât made of paper or of string
Itâs cast into a head of stone
Could I be - of stone - could I be - of stone - could I be
