Oh I'm just wondering, 
just how you have been
my mind was wondering, 
how we might have been

it wasn't meant to be, 
the things you said to me
I should have let them go, 
I should have let you know

Now it's too late 
stealing my head of 
the words that you said
you tried to tell me

<i>[REFRAIN]</i>
Don't throw our love away 
you know I don't want to lose you
Don't watch me walk away, 
you don't know how much I need you

Once I had everything, 
you gave me everything
somehow I let you go, 
and now I'll never know

I could have waited 
you were the vision 
that I couldn't see
you tried to tell me

<i>[REFRAIN]</i>
Don't throw our love away 
you know I don't want to lose you
Don't watch me walk away, 
you don't know how much I need you

And how much is everything
there is only ex-communication

<i>[REFRAIN - 4 TIMES]</i>
Don't throw our love away 
you know I don't want to lose you
Don't watch me walk away, 
you don't know how much I need you

Don't throw our love away ...
