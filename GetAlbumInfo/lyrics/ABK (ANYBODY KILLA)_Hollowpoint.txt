<i>[Intro: Syn]</i>
Two seperate worlds, opposites
Yet alike in so many many ways
Both of these worlds are engaged in an eternal war with each other
The war of good versus evil, which is which, you decide
Only one thing will outlast both armies, only one thing will survive in the end
And that special magical little item is that of which we call
The hollow tip bullet

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Sit back and let me take you into the mind of a killa
Dark Carnival psychopathic wig spiltta (Anybody)
Move and change it's time to rearrange
So love a dinosaur that you can't tame
I bring pain, what you think I'm playin a game?
Detroit is my home, Eastside's what I claim
Fuck a balla, I represent the 313
With tech nines and green tree it's a luxury
That's how it is and I ain't changin for shit
Walk the earth mean muggin, waitin for someone to trip
I'm sick and tired of fuckin waitin for you wannabe thugs to quit
That's why I keep it underground and drop the killa shit
For juggalos that keep it real non-stop
Keep away from juggahos unitl I load up my glock
Cuz in Detroit we got mother fuckin problems
And all the gun play that you hear is my homies tryin to solve them

<i>[Hook x2]</i>
You can't tell me anythang
Hollowpoints control the game
I can tell ya once they're triggered
Things will never be the same (Anybody Killa)

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
I got a brand new tech that I'm dyin to use
Play games with this killa and you destined to loose
Mental stress, keepin me alive
Sniffin lines of gunpowder to start off the night
Curbside gangbanger with some mark ass bitches
Gun smoke from bullet holes leaves you dead in the ditches
I'm just an average individual, street slangin convict
Pocket full of bullets ready to use 'em up quick
You ask my name (ABK), you know the game ain't changed
Labeled as a killa bustin caps all the same
As any other mother fucker with a piece and little bit of attitude
Runnin through the streets actin rude
So hate if you want to, but I'ma keep my focus
And continue with the magic that I practice with the lotus
Psychopathic and I'm down for life
And anyone who disagree let these hollowpoints change your mind

<i>[Hook x2]</i>
You can't tell me anythang
Hollowpoints control the game
I can tell ya once they're triggered
Things will never be the same (Anybody Killa)

<i>[Verse 3]</i>
I feel the urge to murder, there's no need to cure me
Civilized under the light, at night I'm filled with fury
Is it true that the people who you hang with rub off?
Is that why me and Violent J love cutting bitches heads off?
Imagine everytime you woke up, you was gettin choked up
And had to grab a shank and slit a throat up
The type of shit that most people call unreal
But it's the thing that makes you feel the way to deal is just to kill
Crazy ballistic cause my head is untrained
With the empty fuckin wallet so there's so much to gain
If I appeal to you do you think I keep it real with you?
Turn your back and let my hollowpoints drill in you
What type of person do you think that I am?
Because we had a conversation and afterwards we shook hands
Don't get it in your head that I would never hurt you
Cuz the ones that gettin shot are the ones that deserve to
