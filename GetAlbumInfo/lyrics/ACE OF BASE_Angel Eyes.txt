I know that I'm not the first one
You've had love in your path before me
But when your lips touched my lips
It felt like I was kissing destiny

Angel eyes with your angel eyes
Will you always be there to hold me
Angel eyes, I am satisfied
I don't want to hear your story
'Cause I can see the things
I really want to see
I am in love

I believe in what I'm feeling
I'd give everything up just for you
Love is devoted to those who see
That the last dance you dance with a truth

Angel eyes with your angel eyes
Will you always be there to hold me
Angel eyes, I am satisfied
I don't want to hear your story
'Cause I can see the things
I really want to see
In your eyes

Angel eyes just want you here to hold me
Angel eyes...
