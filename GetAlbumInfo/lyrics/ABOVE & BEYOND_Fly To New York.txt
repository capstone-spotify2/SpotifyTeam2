You've been in my dreams
Right there in the seams
In the notes, in the fabric
In the way the day leans

There's so much I'd like to share with you
Share my arms
Share my time
Share almost anything that's mine
Except my fear of losing you

We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know

We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know

You're part of me now
Known me somehow
Since birth
Since I fell down
Since you gave me my crown

It's too much to bear
Too much love there
Full of wonder
I will be free
You can see almost all of me
But not my fear of losing you

Oooh

We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know

We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know?
