Our empire has fallen
The columns came crashing down
Faster that children could outrun the shadows
Drunk with hysteria the survivors are running for their lives
As precious dreams erupt before their very eyes

Tonight, it's over
At long last we will fall
Ruins will fight in our stead

My flesh is burning from the embers
But still the brilliant tale of our utopia survives
Tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn to ash
But the fight for her honor will rage on
I hope I never see the end
I hope I never see the end
I hope I never have to live without her comfort
But for now she dies...
Oh Rome! so full of majesty,
You're gone...

Wind chokes on the ashes as acrid smoke strangles the sun
Their jealous arrows ran, hollow drums pound at the gates
Breaking the din of screams
Our feeble offerings to forgotten Gods are left to rot in temples of their lust
As they lay forth their plans to destroy our pride, our home

Tonight, it's over
At long last we will fall
Ruins will fight in our stead

My flesh is burning from the embers
But still the brilliant tale of our utopia survives
Tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn to ash
But the fight for her honor will rage on
I hope I never see the end
I hope I never see the end
I hope I never have to live without her comfort
But for now she dies...
Oh Rome! so full of majesty,
You're gone...

Beg the flames for our mercy
These aged walls have seen too much
...Beg the flames for our mercy...
To forget the past in the face of this final trial
Watch her crumble so true as mayhem cuts her down
Let them have our treasure, her voice lives on
Let them take our city for her splendor lives on

At long last we will fall
At long last we will fall
At long last we will fall
At long last we will fall
