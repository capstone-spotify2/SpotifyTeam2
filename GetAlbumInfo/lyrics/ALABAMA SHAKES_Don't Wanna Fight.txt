My lines, your lines
Don't cross them lines
What you like, what I like
Why can't we both be right?
Attacking, defending
Until there's nothing left worth winning
Your pride and my pride
Don't waste my time

I don't wanna fight no more <i>[x6]</i>

Take from my hand
Put in your hands
The fruit of all my grief
Lying down ain't easy when
Everyone is pleasing
I can't get no relief

Living ain't no fun
The constant dedication
Keeping the water and power on
There ain't no money left
Why can't I catch my breath?
I'm gonna work myself to death

I don't wanna fight no more <i>[x6]</i>

No, no, no, no!

I don't wanna fight no more <i>[x7]</i>
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight!
I don't wanna fight no more <i>[x8]</i>
