Baby donât, baby donât, treat me right
I better get, better get outta sight
Guess my dinnerâs in the dog tonight
Shouting out, shouting out at me all night
Ringing in my ears till the morning light
Baby just wanna have a fight tonight

Alright, itâs okay
Tomorrowâs another day

I would never tell you lies
You know Iâm not that kind of guy
Cos Iâm just trying to make it right
Trust me you canât trust me
But try

Baby donât, baby donât break away
Hear me out, hear me out, what I say
I canât take it for another day 
Burning up, burning up, baby stop
Cool it down now before you blow your top
I guess the dogâs back sleeping in my spot

Alright, itâs okay
Tomorrow is another day

I would never tell you lies
You know Iâm not that kind of guy
Cos Iâm just trying to make it right
Trust me you canât trust me
But try

Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me 
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me

You know Iâm not that kind of guy
Cos Iâm just trying to make it right

I would never tell you lies
You know Iâm not that kind of guy
Cos Iâm just trying to make it right
Trust me you canât trust me
Trust me you canât trust me
But try

Just trust me
Try
