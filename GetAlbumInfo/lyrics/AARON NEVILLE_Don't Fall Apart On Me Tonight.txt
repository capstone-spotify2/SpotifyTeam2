Just a minute 'fore you leave girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you're trying to achieve girl
Do you think we can talk about it some more
You know the streets are filled with vipers
Who've lost all ray of hope
You know it ain't even safe no more
In the palace of the pope

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you

Come over here from over there girl
Sit down here you can have my chair
I can't see you going anywhere girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can't take you there

Oh, I wish I'd a been a doctor
Maybe I'd a saved some lives that've been lost
Maybe I'd a done some good in this world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you

Oh, I wish I'd a been a doctor
Maybe I'd a saved some lives that've been lost 
Maybe I'd a done some good in this world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you 

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you

(Don't fall apart on me tonight)
Don't fall apart on me tonight

Don't fall apart on me tonight
