Belle...
The Lord and I have been friends for a mighty long time
Belle...
Leaving him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing...
I'd never go so far
cause it's Him no matter who you are
Belle...
oh it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need
(I'd like to take a minute) just to say now...
Belle...
Belle...
the laughter of the sound has quieted down
Belle...
The best thing we could do is have Him around
Let me say this one thing...
I think if love could've found
my heart was lost but now it's found
Belle...
Let's you and I let the love come down
I'm so happy... let me say this...
It seems so easy to me
I've tried to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time
Belle...
Lord, He's my surprisin', my pride and my joy,
Belle...
I know that you can understand
This little country boy
(I'm just a country boy)
Belle...

He brought me safe thus far...
(Let me say this to you lady...)
through many drunken country bars

Oh, let me say,
He's my bright morning star
Belle..
He's my bright morning...
My everything...
Belle...
Belle...

Belle...
I know you're all of these things girl
ya, but He's such a brighter joy...
He's! He's! He's!
Jesus is my!
My everything!
My everything!
In the morning (time)
In the evening (time)
In the daytime
In the nighttime...

He's my everything, yeah!
Belle...
Belle..
