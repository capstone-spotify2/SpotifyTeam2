Save some cigarettes, stealing munchies cause we can
Punk rock, gutter whore, tatted up, my arm is sore
Misfits, turning heads, bitches drinking from the kegs
Moshpit, breaking nails, feeling just like Brody Dalle

We can do this our way
So we'll do it all night long yeah
We can do this our way
So we'll do it all night long yeah

We can party
We can party
We can party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

Teenage growing pains, blue Bacardi in our veins
Rap it up, get a room, 99 NOS balloons
Blow chunks in the sink, fuck it I still need to pee
Cop cars all around, but they'll never shut us down

We can do this our way
So we'll do it all night long yeah
We can do this our way
So we'll do it all night long yeah

We can party
We can party
We can party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
We can party
We can party
We can party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

Ohhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhh, o-ooh
We can party
We can party
We can party all the time

We can party
We can party
We can party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
We can party
We can party
We can party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
