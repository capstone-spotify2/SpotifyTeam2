(I Gotcha Back)

The Women Always Wonder How I, Keep A Man.
They Been Tryin For So Long, And Still Dont Understand.
Its Not The Things I Say, Its The Way I Say It,
Thats Keeps Em Locked Down, Nowhere To Go,
And On Top Of That, Ill Ever Know.

Im Down For Whatever, No Matter How Ya Act.
Ya Never Have To Worry Bout A Thing, I Gotcha Back.
When No One Else Is There, With Me You can Chill.
Because It Feels Real Good,
When You Know Somebodys Got Ya Back.

I Am The Type When I Find A Man I Like,
Its On And Poppin, And No Stoppin, The Things I Do For You.
No Complications, Baby Keep It Real.
Do One To Me, As I Do, And Everything Will Be Cool.
When You Find Yourself In Times Of Trouble,
Remember That Im By Your Side.(Im By Your Side)
Lean On me, When Your Not Strong, Ill Be Your Friend,
Ill Help You Carry On.

Im Down For Whatever, No Matter How Ya Act.
Ya Never Have To Worry Bout A Thing, I Gotcha Back.
When No One Else Is There, With Me You can Chill.
Because It Feels Real Good,
When You Know Somebodys Got Ya Back.(I Gotcha Back)
