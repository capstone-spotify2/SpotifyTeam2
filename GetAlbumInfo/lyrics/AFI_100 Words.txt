This is the final night, boys.
We are the cracks in diamond walls.
I tried to illuminate but the shadows kill.
I'm overshadowed. See how I blend in with nothing?

We're no longer confined because yesterday I burnt the sky.

Now today I question why I fell.
I fell

(We're no longer confined)
I fell
(because yesterday I burnt the sky)
I fell

Because yesterday I...
