Why does this feeling of togetherness
Always scare me away?
Why do the feelings that I have for you
Have to become a word?

Don't say you "love" me -oh no
Don't ask that from me -no no no

That alphabet you call love
That alphabet you call love
That alphabet you call love
Is just a digital tenderness
Tenderness

Here is the start for so many broken people
All with a hard luck story and a sad sad tale

Don't say you love me -oh no
Don't ask that from me -no no no

That alphabet you call love
That alphabet you call love
That alphabet you call love
Is just a digital tenderness
Tenderness

Sometimes
I need to be by myself
I need to be by your side
I need...
Sometimes
I need the company of art
I need the company of friends
I need you

And my heart is stronger
Than a four-letter-long word

Searching the eyes of so many lonely people
Whose cowardice proved much too strong for vice

Don't say you "love" me -oh no
Don't ask that from me -no no no

That alphabet you call "love"
That alphabet you call "love"
That alphabet you call "love"
That alphabet you call "love"
That alphabet you call "love"
That alphabet you call "love"
