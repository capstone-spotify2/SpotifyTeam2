Another day goes by, another setting sun
As the light begins to fade
Upon this silent ship I now chart a course
Yet no wind blows these tattered sails
For reasons lost to time, that I cannot recall
Alone I sail the endless seas
The hands of fate have slain the crew, my only friends
And soon this doom will come for me

And I look back and wonder
Of the times we once shared

I stand here alone on the bow of the ship
Counting the hours 'til I die
Abandoned to fate with no chance of return
I raise up my fist to the sky
But know that these days were the best of our lives
And nothing can take that away
So when we are dead we will all meet again
And fight to the end of our days

Many years have I wandered
Alone and afraid
It seems now I've found a reason to live
As I stare at my grave

I ride the endless tide that's carried me so long
Heavy heart and broken soul
Would this have always been? Is this destiny?
I raise my head and onwards go.

And I know that the end comes
There's no reason to be scared

I stand here alone on the bow of the ship
Counting the hours 'til I die
Abandoned to fate with no chance of return
I raise up my fist to the sky
But know that these days were the best of our lives
And nothing can take that away
So when we are dead we will all meet again
And fight to the end of our days
