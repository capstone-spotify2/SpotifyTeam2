Lovely lady, dressed in blue, teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy, and you know the way
Did you lift him up sometimes, gently on your knee
Did you tell him stories of the world, like mother did to me
And when he fell, did you lift him up, and make everything alright
And did you tell him his prayers at night

I wanna know my lovely lady, lovely lady, dressed, dressed in blue
Oh, God was just your little boy, your little boy and you know the truth
And did you whisper in his ear sweet lullabyes,
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, did he cry

Lovely lady, dressed in blue, oh won't you please teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy, and
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, so teach me how to pray

Teach me how to pray
