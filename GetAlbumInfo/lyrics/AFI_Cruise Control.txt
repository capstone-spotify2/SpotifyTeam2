I will never want to date you while I can learn to hate you.
If you somehow learn to love me, well, that's just my luck.
I would never care if you only wanted my friendship,
but somehow you're disappointed that I'm not a slut.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you, so fuck you.
In my mind there is no doubt that you've been in
and out of many different backseats, many times before.
I can always see your defeat when I won't leave the front seat.
And it seems your disappointed that I'm not a whore.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you, so fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you, so fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you.
I don't want to fuck you, so fuck you.
