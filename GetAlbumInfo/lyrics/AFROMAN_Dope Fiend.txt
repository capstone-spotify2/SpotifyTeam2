Will somebody call me a cab?
I swallowed another tab
I might overdose under the circumstance
So betta yet call me an ambulance

All I wanna do is get high
Between your legs is where my brain is at
'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

I used to smoke marijuana when I was a kid
Now I'm trippin on acid
I'm high on every drug known to mankind
So go ahead and pass it

Between your legs is where my brain is at
'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

Her name was Carolyn
But I can't go home

'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

This butt naked girl sat next to me
And offered me some ecstasy
Then she gave me a big fat kiss
With a mouth full of LSD

'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

Wave your hands in the air
Then wave it like you just don't care

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Repeat after me

My hands are shakin', my nose is twitchin'
My eyeballs are real gigantic
I'm layin' in bed, with a throbbin' head
And I'm trippin' on widespread panic

Maybe I didn't fuck you but little darling don't cry
The fact is I masturbated about an hour before you came by

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
On the road again

Open up your legs and let me stick it in
My favorite past time is making love to my girlfriend
I can't wait to shoot my load again
Shoot my load again
Stick my dick some where it's never been
