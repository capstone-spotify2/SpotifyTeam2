Do it sound tight?

<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i>
Considered a fuck up all of my life
Too smart for my own good all of the time
In kindergarten I got a kick out of pissin' on my classmates
And I recall getting ass whoopings every couple days
I had a Power Ranger bike I wheelied in the street
Got grounded for a month for spray painting it green
I went to middle school and started slacking in my studies
Before the they rise and aimed the gang bangers were my buddies
I wasn't fit for it I needed a tailor
I still went for it
It wasn't out of anger
I needed to be accepted in my neighborhood
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion

I ain't shit
I must be constipating
Cause I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Things ain't always what they seem
If you look close you can see
What's your perception of me?
Is it good? I wish it was

Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

<i>[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]</i>
In ninth grade I started off on the right track
Got a few A's but then I bounced right back
Wasn't aware my main thought was what I should wear
Now that I think about it nobody really cared
I grew up in the church but barely paid attention
Read up on Malcom X and started questioning religion
Became a rebel
I still believe in God
I just doubt the authenticity of Jesus and the Devil
I got my first car and started smoking black and milds
The smell is like a bell and Hades, hella loud
Then it was Newports and Kools on my way to school
My girl hated it but still kissed me in the mouth
I started ditching class more than I attended
I was walking a path that I had not intended
It looked as though I was mad, becoming relentless
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion

I ain't shit
I ain't attracting no flies man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

<i>[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]</i>
I got kicked out, crept back in
If I wasn't fucking I was fussing with my step-dad again
Oh yeah I rapped, didn't take it that serious
But I flowed like an ocean among my peers
Dreams of going off to college in my younger years
Then the whole thought of it sounded nuts I had dumbo ears
Did about a semester then I was outta there
Said if I get one song on radio, I'm outta here
Knowing that low ratio of successful entertainers
I chose to go at people with skulls, but they was brainless
Started smoking weed as soon as purple kush was famous
Shifting my setting eventually as I went through changes
People I seen my whole life appeared to me as strangers
Created a voice through my music and now they speak my language
I was in Jay Rock video for less than 15 seconds
All of a sudden niggas that I looked up to see me as a legend
Now I step in clubs and some bitches give me hugs
But back in P.E. tennis a nigga got zero love
I'm just a hard headed loser
My mamma was trying to save me from stalling out my future

Cause I ain't shit
I don't need no toilet paper man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit
