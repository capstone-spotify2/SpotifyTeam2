Ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me

I know that a mans duty is to have and love a woman
And that's the way it was planned
Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands

It ain't no way, it ain't no way, just ain't no way, ain't no way baby

It ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me

Stop trying to be someone you're not
The hard cold truth is, woman, you paid too much for what you got
And if you need me, baby, say, say you do,
Baby, I, baby, baby, don't you know that I need you

It ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way, it ain't no way, it ain't no way baby, baby, baby, baby
Just ain't no way, sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me
