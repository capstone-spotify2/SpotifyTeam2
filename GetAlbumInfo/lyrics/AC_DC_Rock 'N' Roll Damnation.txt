They say that you play too loud
Well baby that's tough
They say that you got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Baby I'm a fool for you
They say that your mind's diseased, shaky stuff
It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

You say that you want respect
Honey for what
For everything that you done for me
Thanks a lot
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
I been waitin' all night
For a bite of what you got

It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

It's a hard life

Damnation, they're putting you down
Damnation, all over town
Damnation, Cause you're way outta reach
Living on the street you gotta practice what you preach
An it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

Damnation, you left a happy home
Damnation, To live on your own
Damnation, You wanna live in sin
It's a rock 'n' roll
Damnation, Just a bundle of joy
Damnation, you're a toy for a boy
Damnation, you got the dollars in your eye
Always chasin' that pie in the sky
Rock 'n' roll damnation
