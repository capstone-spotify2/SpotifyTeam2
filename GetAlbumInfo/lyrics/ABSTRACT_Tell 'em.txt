Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now
Won't you tell em?
Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now

Looking back like what a year
Always knew we'd get to here
Never wanted overnight
Went to war to win the fight
Still working like I ain't been heard yet
Write like I ain't said a word yet
Labels ain't seen my worth yet
But it's all love I ain't served yet
Couple weeks of summer overseas
Bout to finally get to meet the team
Been a long division but we steady adding up
Seen the vision seeing what they see in us
Tired of hearing comparisons
There's nobody like me be aware of it
I gotta do it for me
I gotta do it for them
Gotta do it for my family
Go get us back up our feet again
These days I invest more
I buy less Js, I take less Ls
So if you pass it to me I'm good
Life got me higher than backwoods
I'm just doing everything I should
So when I say this know I knew I would

Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now
Won't you tell em?
Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now

I got a girl who with me for me
I got a team who believe in the dream
I got a family who want me to win
I got some friends who with me till the end
I got some fans who be ride or die
I got some music to change your life
I know I do cause it's changing mine
Saying I ain't the man would been lie
Use to write about it
Now I see that shit for real
You know I been on a roll
So why reinvent the wheel
I ain't got no time to stall
Guess I hold the pressure in
Game been role playing for ages
Think I'm bout to get it in
I'm the man you took for granted
I'm the one you called a clown
Now the fan base four times bigger than the town
By the you may think my head got too big for the crown
But this ain't bout the ego, this bout loving what you found

Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now
Won't you tell em?
Who the man, who the man now?
Won't you tell me?
Said I'm the man, I'm the man now
