another time -  another place
another answer just in case
it's just a memory that i will soon forget
another glamorous debut
another chance to see right through
your empty promises that mean so much to me

and all at once i get the feeling
that i'll never get the chance to talk to you
and all at once i get the feeling
that i'll never hear you say it isn't true

i had a dream - i saw you in a magazine
i turned the page and you were gone
i can't explain - i can't express the way i feel
it's so complex - it's so unreal

<i>[chorus]</i>

all these places i have been
there all the same - it's just the miles and miles
that set them all apart
and all these faces i have seen
it seems to me that they've been
trying to tell me something from the start

and all at once i get the feeling that i'll
never get the chance to talk to you
and all at once i get the feeling
that i've got to hear you say it isn't true
