There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name

And a candle in the window, a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window oh its Christmas in your heart, in your heart

Maybe it's just wishful thinking I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve

There's a candle in the window,
There's a flame against the night
There's candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take lots of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go
There's going to be a candle burning,
It's always nice to know
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
A simple candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
Your heart your heart
A candle in the window
A candle in the window...
