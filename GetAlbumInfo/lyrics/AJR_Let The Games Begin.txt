Let the games begin <i>[x2]</i>

Passed out, all my friends went and passed out
So much for the night
Last round for a.m. lovers that's how I come alive

I'm gonna be a people person in a room of people people
Imma keep on running this shit 
Let the games begin
A people person in a room of people people
Imma be the kid for the win
Let the games begin
Let the games begin <i>[x6]</i>

Cab ride just up here on the right side
Two more for the road
Sometimes when that game hits the wrong vibe you take it home

I'm gonna be a people-person in a room of people-people
Imma keep on running this shit
Let the games begin
A people-person in a room of people-people
Imma be the kid for the win
Let the games begin
Let the games begin <i>[x6]</i>

Keep on running this shit
Be the kid for the win, singing
Let the games begin
A people-person in a room of people-people
Imma keep on running this shit
Let the games begin
A people-person in a room of people-people
Imma be the kid for the win
Let the games begin
Go!
Let the games begin! <i>[x4]</i>
Keep on running this shit
Be the kid for the win, singing
Let the games begin
