Oh, these guys that are playing your heart 
tryin' to trick a girl like it's an art 
Here today but he's gone tomorrow 
tryin' to get with this, I don't need the sorrow 

Why, can't they see what this girl 
wants, why are all the guys all 
big smile, sweet talk 
while checking out my bodyparts 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My boy is makin' his move slow 
My boy knows how to make a girl glow 
My boy he doesn't come late, no 
always comes when the time is right though 
I don't need no fast love I need a love that last so 
My boy won't you come and rescue me 
(won't you come and rescue me) 

Talking 'bout your car 'bout your cash 'bout your game 
Everybody's sounding the same it's a shame 
They are promoting when I need devotion 
You need to slow it down show me some emotion 

Why, can't they see what this girl 
wants, why are all the guys all 
"my love is your love" 
the first night you meet them 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Ohh, I'm looking for the real deal 
Yeah, I'm looking for a love that feels 
I want my boy 
My boy won't you come and rescue me 
Ohh won't you come and rescue me 

(yeah... oooh... yeah...) 

<i>[Chorus (2x impro/variation)]</i>
