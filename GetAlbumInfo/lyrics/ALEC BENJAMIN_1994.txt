This is where I broke my wrist
Where I thought I could fly
Thinking I was Superman
So you know you can't cry
Cause I wanted to be just like them
And save my city from crime
I wanted to be just like them, just like them, just like, them

Campbell's chicken noodle soup
When you stay home from school
Remember watching MTV
When there was still music for you
Just a kid on Cholla Street
From my city built in the sand
My father said "you'll be a man, be a man, be a man"

I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
I was, I was born
In 1994

I guess Santa Claus is just not real
And Batman can't fly
And nobodyâs invincible
Because I know people die
I saw it on the news one day
When the towers fell down
September's not the same place now
Same place now, same place, now

Now tell me who you wanna be
Because you grow up too fast
Cut my hair and sag my jeans
And never show up to class
Get ready cause it's time to leave
So pack up your bags
And go be who you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
I was, I was born
In 1994

My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country tis of thee, be who you wanna be
My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country, my country, my country, my...

I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
I was, I was born
In 1994
