Sometimes I feel we're still together
Only a touch away,
Memories of you I still remember
Words that you used to say, used to say.

Stand by my side, I need you near me
Feeling you close to me
Stand by my side, I see things clearly
You're all I ever need.
Spending the time we had together
Loving you more each day
It was strong, getting so much stronger
Now we're both apart.

(Stand by my side)
There's so many things I must tell you
(Now I must try)
To change the position and make you stay
(Stand by my side)
What else must I do to convince you?
(Now I must try)
Now I must try.

Faced with another situation
We wouldn't be the same,
Waiting for some communication
Feelings are bound to change, bound to change.

Stand by my side, I need you near me
Feeling you close to me
Stand by my side, I see things clearly
You're all I ever need.
Spending the time we had together
Loving you more each day
It was strong, getting so much stronger
Now we're both apart.

(Stand by my side)
There's so many things I must tell you
(Now I must try)
To change the position and make you stay
(Stand by my side)
What else must I do to convince you?
(Now I must try)
Some other way to make you change your mind.

Stand by my side, I need you near me
Feeling you close to me
Stand by my side, I see things clearly
You are all I ever need.
Spending the time we had together
Loving you more each day
Getting so much stronger
Now that we are both apart.

Stand by my side, I need you near me
Feeling you close to me
Stand by my side, I see things clearly
You are all I ever need.
Spending the time we had together
Loving you more each day
It was strong, getting so much stronger
Now that we are both apart....
