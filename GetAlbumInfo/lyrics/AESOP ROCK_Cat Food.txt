<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Considering a regular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food
There it is
Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

<i>[Hook 1:]</i>
Catch 'em on the lam
(I ain't joking)
No maps, no muster point
(Nah, I ain't joking)
I put a pebble on a tomb
(I ain't joking)
Makin bath tub meth
I'm joking
Here we go

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
The whip got a tongue and teeth
Too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a Tungston bleep
When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island
Stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science
Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us
Back at the battering ram post-haste
Cro-mags, wait till this Saturday plant grow legs
All you hear is intermittent code names
Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
Unfrozen part of his new J.O
Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao
Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
I was in the dark, dodging and burning

<i>[Hook 2:]</i>
Maybe cause I look like an ugly doll
(I ain't joking)
Pack a wallop in the wheelhouse
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Leave brass tacks everywhere
(I ain't joking)
I own many many homes
I'm joking
Here we go

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
All hog to we know costume
Black hoodie you can set your watch to
Tall drink, depths like an air raid
Radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain
Down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links
Upperway, upper-case tri-state style kings
Get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves
Lights off, spine on sideways
Riding down the block, scooping Bobby in a boogie-down
Tome told me tell 'em "Hello, 7: 30 noodle-town"
Cool 'em down, global domination over salt bake
Situation commanding a broke dude cosplay
You don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows
The summary is as follows:
"These hate those and this thinks, that's absurd"
Yip yap, y'all cats and birds

<i>[Hook 3:]</i>
Meow meow meow meow meow
(I ain't joking)
Talking rubes on the radio
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Uh, suckers never play me
(I ain't joking)
I found Jimmy Hoffa's body
I'm joking
Here we go
