There'll be some slow walkin'
Gonna be some sad talkin'
There'll be some flowers bringin'
Gonna be some sad singin'
Over you, I say over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

There'll be some long black limousines
People peepin' from their window screens
Parade of cars with their headlights on
All of that will be goin' on
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

There'll be a hole about six feet deep
For you baby to take your sleep
Into a pine box an' down you'll go
Where you will stay where it's free of snow
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby

If I ever hear you say we're through
All your folks will be dressed in black
Ride a long black cadillac
Yeah, baby they'll be puttin' you away
The funeral home'll have the business that day
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

Say I want to slay you baby, whoa now
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

Say you'll never leave me
I say you'll never leave me
Say I'm gonna get rid of you , baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

Whoa, I love you
No tellin' what I'd do
That's why baby
I want to do all these things to you
