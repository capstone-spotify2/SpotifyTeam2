You stand in the doorway
A block up the street
Ringing the doorbell
Thereâs tapping of feet
High yellow hair
And a worn brown suit...
Enter, and break the news

Now tell me the story
I give it the time
No need to worry
Everythingâs fine
Iâll take you away
From the name-calling scene
Sure... you can bring your magazine

Cold and windblown on the old bandstand
You and I walking hand in hand
A neon-glow shining
Down on us
Donât wait up for us
Donât wait up for us

Now tell me the story
Iâll give it the time
When you stop looking
Then you will find
Iâll take you away
From this name-calling scene
Just bring your magazine

Cold and windblown on the old bandstand
You and I walking hand in hand
A neon-glow shining
Down on us
Donât wait up for us
Donât wait up for us
