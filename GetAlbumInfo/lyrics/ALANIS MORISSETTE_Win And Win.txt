In my old days someone won
Those were days of win-lose
In those bleak times I was better
I sat high: looking down by a nose

Changed direction: looking up
I am not worthy to be with you
We are separate, Iâm inferior
I have yearnings to sit across from you

âCause weâre eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partners sister brother

Both directions speak a lie
Up or down, I can feel you
As we battle with our power
We are separate, not looking across

âCause weâre eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partners sister brother

These delusions of our grandeur
We are locked in the struggle
These lies of status lower
These conclusions, weâre in trouble

âCause weâre eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partners sister brother

Same value.... same value....
