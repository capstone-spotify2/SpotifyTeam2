Blonde bad and beautiful
In the hot summer sun
With her tight dress painted on
Fahrenheit 101
She got the long legs to prove it
The back end to move it
She's triple x movie just walking by
Lip-gloss high heels I'm losing my mind
She's coming at me like a wrecking ball
Upstairs downstairs she got it all

Blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful she got it all
She's blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful

I'd fight like a lion
To be her human shield
Yeah sell my soul to the devil
To let her walk all over me
She's a wet drink in the desert of lust
Got me tongue tied I'm ready to bust
She's like a rose in bloom, a love tattoo
That's under my skin and there's nothing I can do
She's coming at me like the blazing sun
I'm gonna get burned but I know she's the one

Blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful she got it all
Blonde bad and beautiful
She's blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful

I see her coming my way
I got something to say
That girls is on fire
Red hot wired gonna fill ya with desire

Blonde bad and beautiful
She's blonde bad and beautiful
She's blonde bad and beautiful
She's blonde bad and beautiful

She's got it all

Blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful she got it all
Blonde bad and beautiful
She's blonde bad and beautiful
Blonde bad and beautiful
