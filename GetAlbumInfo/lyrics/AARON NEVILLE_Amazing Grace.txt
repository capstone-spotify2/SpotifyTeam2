Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once, I once was lost, oh,  now am found
I was blind, oh, but now I see

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have, I have already, already come
T'was grace that brought me safe this far
And grace shall lead me home

Our world shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, who called me here, here below
Will be forever mine
