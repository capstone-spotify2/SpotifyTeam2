It's been about a couple of days gone by 
When I last saw you 
When you said bye-bye 
Then you walked away and left me alone 
All get is a dial tone 
When I call your phone 
Occasionally I'll roll about your way
I thought about the words that I could say 
But you ain't trying to feel me 
You don't even wanna' heal me 

<i>[BRIDGE #1]</i>
Oh 
Is it my turn to cry over you? 
'Cos no matter what I do 
Those rainy days won't leave me alone 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
What kind of love leaves you feeling cold 
All alone with nobody to hold 
Don't wanna' feel like I did that day 
Let the Rain wash the pain away 
Sometimes I think I hear you call my name 
Sometimes it's just my mind playing games 
But nothings changed 
It's still all the same 
Let the Rain wash the pain away 

See your picture all up in a magazine 
With some other cat I've never seen 
You was looking more beautiful then you've ever been 
Here come those lonely feelings again 
I must be tripping on myself 
'Cos the fact that you're with somebody else 
It's getting me down 
Girl, I can't deny 
I guess this is what it sounds like 
When the doves cry 

<i>[BRIDGE #2]</i>
Oh 
Did you choose girl or do it for him? 
'Cos no matter what I do 
Those rainy days won't leave me alone 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[break]</i>
