I just came down from Chippewa
Had as station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by when your memory came flooding in and you closed that door.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
