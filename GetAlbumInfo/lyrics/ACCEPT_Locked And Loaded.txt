Ever have a feeling... Comin' from behind
You catch a fleeting glimpse from the corner of your eye
Your worst nightmare's... 'round the bend
you're falling off a cliff and there's no end

You feel like a number... a target on the wall
you need a place to hide but you feel ten feet tall
Full moon's risin'... I see it in your eyes
Hiding within the shadows of the night

There's no escape... go ahead and run
(We've got your number)
You've been sold out... the price is right
You're worth more dead than alive

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Locked and loaded... hot upon your trail
Locked and loaded... licensed to kill

Runnin' through the jungle... 'cover of the night
It'll do no good I got you in my sight
Ya begging for mercy... I got nothin' to say
Just run like hell cos ya know it's time to pay

There's no escape... go ahead and run
(We've got your number)
You've been sold out... the price is right
You're worth more dead than alive

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Locked and loaded... hot upon your trail
Locked and loaded... licensed to kill

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Locked and loaded... hot upon your trail
Locked and loaded... licensed to kill
(locked) locked and loaded
(locked) locked and loaded
(locked, locked and loaded)
Licensed to kill
