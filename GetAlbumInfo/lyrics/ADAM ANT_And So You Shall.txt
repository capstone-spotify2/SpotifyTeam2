Life is like a pantomime
Where boys and girls sing all the time

I wish I wish that I could dance
Like Michael Jackson NO chance

I wish I wish that I could make records so good
That people would
Buy two instead of one in case
They damaged it and so replace

Oh, so you shall
So you shall
So you shall
So you shall

Life is like a pantomime
Where boys and girls sing all the time

I wish I wish that I could dance
Like Michael Jackson NO chance

Oh, so you shall
So you shall
So you shall
So you shall

Look behind you! Where?
There! Look behind you!
Where? There!
Look behind you! Where?

Look behind you! Where?
There! Look behind you!
Where?

I don't care just what you say 
Because you're not my genie anyway

I wish I wish that I could make records so good
That people would
Buy two instead of one in case
They damaged it and so replace

Oh, so you shall
So you shall
So you shall
So you shall

The night was cold, the air so damp
I stumbled on a dirty lamp
I gave it a rub when upon my soul
"I'm the genie, hello"

Genie's cool in large amounts
He says he knew Basey before he could count
That's my little joke he said and smiled
I got my bubbles and this cat's wild

Wouldn't it be nice if all
There were no journalists at all
"Good idea" I heard him say
"I bought my Beano anyway"

Oh, so you shall
So you shall
So you shall
So you shall

I wish I wish that I could smile
Like a certain Terry Lee Miall
I wish I wish that I could smile
Like a certain Terry Lee Miall

I wish I wish I wish I wish
That nice young girls didn't smell of fish
I wish I wish that I could smile
Like a certain Terry Lee Miall
I wish I wish I wish I knew
