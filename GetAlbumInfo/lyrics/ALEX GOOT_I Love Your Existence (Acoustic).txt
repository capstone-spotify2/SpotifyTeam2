Perfection is defined when your heart beats next to mine

and time stands still for us.
My hand in your hair, and yourâs on my chest

Moments with you are my lifeâs best.

We crossed paths for a reason
The planets aligned in that particular season
Its clear to me that well eventually be
Inseparable

I love your existence
and I canât get enough

Your song is sung in your beautiful voice
My senses rush cause they have no other choice
I breathe you in, and I see through your eyes
You are an angel in a beautiful disguise.

We crossed paths for a reason
The planets aligned in that particular season
Its clear to me that well eventually be
Inseparable

I love your existence
and I canât get enough

So pucker up and embrace the greatness, you get me high and erase my sadness
I love your existence, and I canât get enough
