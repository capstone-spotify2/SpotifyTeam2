Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken...

Get ready, get set
Turn your head to the left
Turn your head to the right
Can you go all night?
Stomp to the front, do what you want

Get ready to...

Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken...

Get ready, get set
Turn your head to the left
Turn your head to the right
Can you go all night?
Stomp to the front, do what you want
Take it to the back, let your tail go
Start out slow, take it down low
And you're down on the ground, go round and round
Go round and round, go round and round
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Get ready to...
