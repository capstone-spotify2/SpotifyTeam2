Climb the fence and in thru the side door
Past the sarcophagi laid down on the dirt floor
There we were holding hands
Singing thru the hole in the ceiling
Into the heavens
I'm in your church at night
Singing, hallelujah at the top of my lungs
No one spoke as our voices rose
Stars were shining and so were our souls
But now its just memory burnt in my brain
The power that we felt that night will never be explained
Im in your church at night
Singing, hallelujah at the top of my lungs
