I just left out of corpus and I'm heading into Nashville for the day
I left my mark on music row, now back out on the road, more shows to play

I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines

I've played concert halls and holes in walls and places that a show just shouldn't be
There's stadiums and late night shows on every major network on TV

And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines

Well, I just left West Virginia, one more in Wabash and Then I'll come home
I can take this guitar off my back and hang up these ol boots cause I'm gone

And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've followed yellow lines til I can't see
I'll never know where this road's takin' me
