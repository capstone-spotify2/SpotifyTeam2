Once a girl
In mommy's world
Laughing, rhyming, singing songs
In her newly learnt tongue

Now a girl
In this world
Married to a stranger's name
Writing to him all the same

And, oh, but
Where can she go
If she's going alone?
Where can she go
If she's going alone?
Where can she go
To avoid the love goodbye?

All the same
Letters answer letters in a round about way
"Sweet darling" they commence
But she no longer feels that way

Oh, there's not a soul
In the streets below
She's sitting by the window
Clinging to the phone
Dialing endless numbers
No reply
Love goodbye

Where can she go
If she's going alone?
Where can she go
If she's going?
Where can she go
If she's going alone?
She's going alone
She's going alone
