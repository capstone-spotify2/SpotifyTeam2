<i>[Intro:]</i>
1 am in the morning,
I only know bass in my headphones no nothing
Just give me the sample,
There we go
I'm talkin bout bitches too,
I love you all baby
Oh we just batter up

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Ah, it's just me and the sample, I wrote this in pajamas
I wrote this while I'm fucking, think her name is Jenna
People sleepin on me, fuck you where your standards?
Oral head for breakfast, my little bitch perfected
Get that with no protection, I shoot, she intercept it
See sex is our connection, no love is currently present
Just play my corner back, I leave her coming back
Like Dion in the game, I'm bringing my quarterback
Grab a condo nigga, I'm worth them 7 figures
So kick o key to pistol and be true with your sister
She says she love the crew, put 4 G's on the coupe
Hurricane Sandy, the rollie flooded too
See it's just me and the sample, no 808 survive
But still I hope on the beat and I murder that bitch, I'm beasting dog
Flow as hell on earth, RIP to y'all
You know I murder shit, yellow tape involved
That's a true story, crib 2 stars,
Know some old homies still drinking 40's,
Hustlin every morning on that same corner,
Money the root of evil, turning some to informants, damn

<i>[Outro:]</i>
Life is such a bitch, all my hoes are thick
All my whips are on, haters suck a dick
Shout out to the sample, shout out to them dancers
Shout out to them exes and this nigga answer
I be hella styling, foreigns with no mileage
Samples on refreshin, pistol in my possesion
Take your bitch and keep er, call that repossesion
I'm a pour more Siroc, be back in a second
