Let's have a real good time, yeah, yeah
Some people don't know what it means
To have a real, real good time

Say it son, see I remember long time ago, yeah
My mother told me, she said son, son
She said son, son, son no matter where you go
Try to have yourself a real, real good time

So I thought tonight would be a fine time
For you and I to get together
And clap your hand like this
One, two, three, four

Have a real good time, have a real
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time
Hey, let's have a good time, one time
Hey, let's have a good time, c'mon

We gonna laugh 'n' shout trouble's over
All the bad dreams will be comin' up in clover
And we gonna sing with the heavenly choir
Say hello never say bye bye

We'll have a good time, no, let's have a good time
We'll have a real good time, let's have a good time
No, let's have a good time

Let us hearts be workin' together
Let our souls be singin' together
Let our love be what we're prayin' for

Oh, let me say one thing
I can see our destiny yeah right up ahead and
Right up ahead in front of me, yeah but
Rise up now, freedom now will set you free
Clap your hands with me

Have a good time, have a good time
Everybody have a good time
I am myself, have a good time

Let me feel it, have a good time
Have a good time
Everybody supposed to let it free
Have a good time

Have a good time, have a good time
Everybody in the studio, have a good time
Have a good time
