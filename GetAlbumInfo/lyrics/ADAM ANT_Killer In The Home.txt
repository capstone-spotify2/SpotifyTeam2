I live the life that I've been left
I leave most things unspoken
But deep inside Geronimo
Is tearing me apart

I've seen him in the streets
And I've seen him in the pictures
Killer in the home
Killer in the home

Now's the time I must digress
From going through the motions
Take my head out of its sling
Free the warrior

I'll fight him in my dreams
And I'll fight him till he kills me
Killer in the home
Killer in the home

I live the life that I've been left
I leave most things unspoken
But deep inside Geronimo
Is tearing me apart

I've seen him in the streets
And I've seen him in the pictures
Killer in the home
Killer in the home

(oh well) They cut you in half with a gun
And they give you a bandaid
(yeah) They gut you in half with a gun
And they give you a bandaid

Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home

Oh well they cut you in half with a gun
And they give you a bandaid
Yeah they gut you in half with a gun
And they give you a bandaid

Killer, killer, killer...

Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer...
Is the home
