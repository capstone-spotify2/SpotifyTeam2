I won't forget her
She was once my love

When I hold you in my arms
Oh yeah
You know I'll let you come to no harm
Oh yeah

But if one day
Much like today
You stop and wonder what I'd prefer
Well, you know I won't forget her

I won't forget her
She was once my love

Did you see it in my eyes
Oh yeah
Did it make you realise
Oh yeah

That one day
Much like today
My mind would wonder
If she's still there

Cause you know I won't forget her

I won't forget her
She was once my love

When I hold you in my arms
Oh yeah
She was once my love

I won't forget her
She was once my love
