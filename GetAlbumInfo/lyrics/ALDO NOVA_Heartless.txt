Again I sit, I'm waiting at the telephone
Another night just listening to the radio
This ain't the first time that you left me on my own
But it's gotta be a frozen heart that leaves another in the dark and all alone

If you can't see what you're doing to me

You gotta be heartless
Yeah you gotta be without a soul
You gotta be heartless
You gotta be (oooh) stone cold

How many times do you say the lines
and not mean the words you say
How many hearts can you tear apart
till the feeling gets in the way
Why should I believe it's gonna be any different now
When anything you say and do is so unfair and so untrue
you always let me down

If you can't see what you're doing to me

You gotta be heartless
Yeah you gotta be without a soul
You gotta be heartless
You gotta be (oooh) stone cold

Yeah, you gotta be...

If you can't see what you're doing to me

You gotta be heartless
Yeah you gotta be without a soul
You gotta be heartless
You gotta be (oooh) stone cold
You gotta be heartless
