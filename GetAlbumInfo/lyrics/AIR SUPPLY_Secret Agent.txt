Well I've got friends in the States
And I've got friends out in space
When information's your game
The whole world knows your name
And so they gave me a code
To work this treacherous road
For all the agents I know
Must work incognito

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I love my trade,
I've got my future made.
I put my life on the line
To save this country of mine
And they reward me with love
And see I have a good time.
So all my moves must be fast
Cos every day is my last
A secret agent that's slow
Almost certain to go.


<i>[Chorus]</i>
I've got friends in the States
I've got friends out in space
When information's your game
The whole world knows your name
And so they gave me a code
To work this treacherous road
For all the agents I know
Must work incognito.
