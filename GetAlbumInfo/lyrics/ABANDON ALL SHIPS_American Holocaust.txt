We have created
The humanity destroyer
All we have hated
Kill the employer

A product of the 21st century
I am alone
Burning in the infirmary
This is my home

The American dream
Will die in a waiting room

We need a resolution
Save our fucking souls
An honest contribution
To dig out of these holes

A product of the 21st century
I am alone
Burning in the infirmary
This is my home

I will not die in a waiting room
the American dream
a product of the 21st century
will die in a waiting room
