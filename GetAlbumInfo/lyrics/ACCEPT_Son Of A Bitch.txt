You make the stars 
Illusions and dreams 
You're what you are 
D'you know what I mean

I hear you clear 
See in your eyes 
Lying to please 
It pleases to lie

You say it's your way 
You say we'll make it right to the top 
Your bullshit gets me 
What have you got

I don't believe 
A word you say 
You make me laugh 
Get outta my way

You say it's your way 
Now listen to what I think of you:

Son of a bitch, kiss my ass 
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch, you asshole, son of a bitch 
Cock suckin' motherfucker I was right - take this

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh 

Son of a bitch Kiss my ass 
Son of a bitch, ...

Son of a bitch you asshole
Son of a bitch, ...

Cut you three times below the ass to short to shit 
Two timing son of a dog
