You don't get dressed up for me no more 
Don't do your make up for me no more
Don't clean the place up for me no more 
We sleep and wake up 
Make love no more
No late night movies with me no more
Play fighting jacuzzis with me no more
Don't shake your booty for me no more 
Look what you done to me 
Can't speak no more 
Yeah, girl 
I just wanna be a better man 
I'm far from an angel or reverend
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
No dirty dancing 'tween us no more 
And no romancing 'tween us no more 
There's no affection 'tween us no more 
There's no direction where do I go
They wanna see us let go but I'm sure you know 
That I will never walk out that door 
And I'm sure you know 
That I will be there to fight for you and will look out for you 
Even though you were letting go 
You will always be my only 
No I'll never leave you loney
You're my friend, you're my homie
I'm coming home-y

I just wanna be a better man 
I'm far from an angel or reverend
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again 
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more 
Wanna let you know that I'm like your shadow
And no matter where you go my heart will follow
Even though you've seen a lot, heard a lot 
One thing's for sure is we're all we've got 
Hope to ease the pain by telling you just one thing 
That I'll always love you 
I just wanna be a better man
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more 
No more no more no more no more
