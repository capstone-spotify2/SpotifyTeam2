You have my heart
We'll never be worlds apart
Baby in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there
With you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always we your friend
I took it off
Ima stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than never
Know that we still have each other
You can stay under my umbrella
You can stay under my umbrella
Ela, ela ela, eeeeee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, eeeee

These fancy things will never come in between
You've had my entertain here for infinity
When the world took its part
And the world dealt its cards
And if the hand is hard
Together will mend you heart

Because when the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always we your friend
I took it off
Ima stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than never
Know that we still have each other
You can stay under my umbrella
You can stay under my umbrella
Ela, ela ela, eeeeee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, eeee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, ela, eee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, eee
Under my umbrella

You can run into my arms
It's ok, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
Come on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more, more

Because when the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always we your friend
I took it off
Ima stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than never
Know that we still have each other
You can stay under my umbrella
You can stay under my umbrella
Ela, ela ela, eeeeee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, eeee
Under my umbrella, ela, ela, ela, ela, eee
Under my umbrella
