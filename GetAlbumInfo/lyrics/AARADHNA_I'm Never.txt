<i>[VERSE 1:]</i>
Close my eyes
Everytime you hold me tight
Don't let go, no
Just hold me close
It feels so good, things that you do
Boy I am..so in love with you
And I wanna let you know that
I'm never, I'm never

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'm never, no baby you're with me
I'm never
I'm never

When you're not 'round
I can't go on, I feel so down (whoa)
Lose control
Hurts my soul
It feels so good the things that you do
That's why I am so in love with you
And I wanna let you know that
I'm never
I'm never

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'm never, no baby you're with me
I'm never
I'm never
(ooh yeah)
(oh oh oh oh whoa-oh whoa-oh)

<i>[BRIDGE:]</i>
Because you put me first no other man has put me first before
Because you cared for me no other man has cared like this before
Because you treat me right no other man could ever treat me like you do
Everything you do feels good that's why I'm gon' keep lovin' you (you)
Loving you
Gon' keep lovin' you

<i>[CHORUS: Repeat til fade]</i>
I'm never gonna say goodbye (baby)
I'm (I won't) never (I won't let go) gonna leave your side
I'm never, no baby (you're with me yeah) you're with me
I'm never
I'm never
