When I see you itâs such a reaction
And Baby, you got what it takes to jangle my brain
Now youâre looking so good
And youâre such an attraction
And I just wanna celebrate...celebrate...

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You gimme a feelinâ because youâre on my mind
And I start believing until the end of time
Well, all I know I can sleep because Iâm thinking âbout you
And all I know and every day you drive me so crazy

When Iâm close to you, girl 
Youâre so contagious
Now Iâm looking at you 
I know that youâre the one
And Baby, everything about you is so outrageous
And I just wanna celebrate...celebrate...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Lead break...

When Iâm playing with you thereâs a chemical reaction
And everything about you has gone to my soul...Oh, Yeah!
And Baby, I just wanna celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...

You gimme a...gimme a...you gimme a...
You gimme a feelinâ because youâre on my mind, Oh, yeah!
And I start believing until the end of time
Well, all I know I canât sleep because Iâm thinking âbout you
And all I know and every day you drive me so crazy, crazy
You drive me fucking nuts!
