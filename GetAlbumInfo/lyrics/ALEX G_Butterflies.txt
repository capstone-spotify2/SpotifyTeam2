Can you feel it?
In the air like you can breathe it?
Watch it break through the ceiling
And you know it ain't coming down
And I made it, like a song you keep repeating
Now my heart is overheated
And I'm tired of it burning down

Talking back and forth
"Hopping" back and forth baby
Trying to let it go
Trying to make it look easy
Now I can't hold back

The butterflies
You brought them back to life
Now I'm alive inside
You brought them back to life
Tonight the world is on our side
I feel the spark ignite
You brought me back to life
Back to life

I was waiting
On the edge of something wicked
Never thought I'd find a reason
To lower my guard and try
Now I see it
In your eyes, something deeper
And you wore me like a fever
And I'm ready to walk the line

Talking back and forth
"Hopping" back and forth baby
Trying to let it go
Trying to make it look easy
Now I can't hold back

The butterflies
You brought them back to life
Now I'm alive inside
You brought them back to life
Tonight the world is on our side
I feel the spark ignite
You brought me back to life
Back to life

I think I'm falling for you now
But I'm afraid to let it out
I used to hold it in but you're so worth the risk yeah

Talking back and forth
"Hopping" back and forth baby
Trying to let it go
Trying to make it look easy
Now I can't hold back

The butterflies
You brought them back to life
Now I'm alive inside
You brought them back to life
Tonight the world is on our side
I feel the spark ignite
You brought me back to life
Back to life
