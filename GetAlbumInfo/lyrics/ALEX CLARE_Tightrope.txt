Life's a tightrope,
And you're standing on one toe.
Don't let the fear take hold of you,
You're bound to fall to the ground below.
Pick yourself up again,
Over the edge again,
Hold on to your hopes and dreams.
When all seems to be lost,
Don't start to count the costs,
Just go and begin again.

Tight rope walker, tight rope walker.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The only thing I'm sure of is, to have no fear at all,
Just go, keep on going on.
And the only thing that's certain is sometimes you're bound to fall,
Just go, keep on going on.

When all you work for,
Comes tumbling to the ground.
Don't let the sadness fill your heart,
Tomorrow may be a better day.
Lift your head up again,
You know you'll start again,
No matter what may come of it.
You know there's more to life,
I'm sure that you'll survive,
You know what you have to do.

Tight rope walker, tight rope walker.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The only thing I'm sure of is to have no fear at all,
Just go, keep on going on.
And the only thing that's certain is sometimes you're bound to fall,
Just go keep, on going on.

Who knows, who knows, who knows what may come tomorrow,
Who knows, who knows, who knows, what tomorrow may bring.
Who knows, who knows, who knows what may come tomorrow,
Who knows, who knows, who knows, what tomorrow may bring.

The only thing I'm sure of is to have no fear at all,
Just go, keep on going on,
And the only thing that's certain is sometimes you're bound to fall,
Just go, keep on going on <i>[x2]</i>
