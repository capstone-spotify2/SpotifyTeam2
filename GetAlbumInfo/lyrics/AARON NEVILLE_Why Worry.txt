There's no need for you to worry about anything
Who can say what the future gonna bring
But if you worry about tomorrow
It will only bring you sorrow

Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

Hold your head up high
Face the future with a smile
Things'll be better
It just takes a little while
So when your feelin' low, down and out
You're gonna shine without a doubt

Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

Life is just what you make it
Can be good or can be bad
How can you miss something you never had
When things go wrong don't forget
There's no need for you to get upset

Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

It's gonna be alright
