Before the rollie, before the fame
Before the money, before the game
Before them bitches
Before they ever knew my name
Before the rollie, before the rollie
Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money
Before the rollie, before the rollie
The same circle, the same homies

<i>[Ace Hood:]</i>
My same niggas, no new friends
Since day one, nigga no loose ends
Just a young nigga, outchea every day
I'm a get it by any means
That was just my mind frame
Before the Gucci and Louis
Before the Rollie dog I won't do it
They nigga fuck with me when I was broke
You ain't gonna stunt with me when I do it
Talk is cheap gotta put in that work
Remember them days I was ridin' in the merk
No A/C cause the shit don't work
Plus no radio to make shit worse
I'da come a long way and they know it,
Fuck where you at it's about where you goin'
Can't sit around and wait for no money
Ain't no naw nigga can't do it
Boy I did this shit for my niggas
Since day one I been a go getter
Now my money right and these hoes on me
Ho well go figure (Hoodnation)

Ain't never had shit for' my dream
Ain't never sell no work to them fiends
Ain't never snitchin' and tell on my dogs
Wakin' up every day for that cream
Nigga I was down and out in that field
So stressed out because of them deals
Ain't no kinda hope in my city
Most my homies dead or in jail
Every night I toss and I turn
Feelin' like the Devil all on my back
Still I'm praying times get better
Had a few thoughts sell in that pack
Boy my mom gon' cuss me out,
Runnin' her blood pressure so high
When that money comin' in slow
It'll be a couple homies that rot
I'm that same nigga from out of Deerfield
Ain't shit changed except a rap deal
Gotta live nigga actin' funny,
Now I know how niggas in the trap feel
Ya'll rather me broke than be fucked up
And my same hood and those same chucks
I look back today throw prayers up
Now I never forget where I came from

Before the rollie man it was cuffs
Hard times man shit was tough
I was told don't trust niggas
Be the main ones to come and hit you up
Still ridin' round like I ain't rich as fuck
Young niggas we clippin' up
Before the rollie hoes fronted on me
Now I pull up on em like bitch what's up?
Young niggas ballin'
Fuck niggas hatin'
Before I had a rollie
I ain't have no patience
A nigga ran up on me,
Bitch ass situations
We cap'n gown you pussy niggas ain't talkin' graduation
See there was something 'bout that Rollie when it touched my wrist
Something 'bout that Rollie when I fucked your bitch
Cause it caught her eye and she sucked my dick
She told you lies and you trust that bitch
Like hol' up
Ya'll niggas hatin' on me
When all these bad bitches waitin' on me
And all that shit you pray on me,
I still kill niggas like shame on me
