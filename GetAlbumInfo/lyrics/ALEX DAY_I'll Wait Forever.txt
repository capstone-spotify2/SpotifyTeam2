I'm letting you go dear
I think that its time
If you could feel the storm in my heart
You would understand why

I've been waiting for years now
I've been waiting for us
So I hope that you forgive me when I say enough is enough

I think you are the one
And I waste my life holding on

I don't think you'll ever be mine
But I'll wait forever
I'll wait for your heart
And you'll let me wait too
All you have to say is we'll be together
And I'd wait for you

If this doesn't end I'll hold on forever
Waiting for a girl to make good on her word
So I have to stop
Or I'll wait forever
Forever for you

So I'm letting you go now
I don't want to pretend
Bit I'm begging you please change my mind
Coz I don't want this to end

I think you might love me
And I know things are tough
But if you're ever gonna keep me around
This is the time to speak up

Coz I don't think you'll ever be mine
But I'll wait forever
I'll wait for your heart
And you'll let me wait too
All you have to say is we'll be together
And I'd wait for you

If this doesn't end I 'll hold on forever
Waiting for a girl to make good on her word
So I have to stop
Or I'll wait forever
Forever for you.

I think you are the one
The one
And I'd waste my life holding on
Holding on

I don't think you'll ever be mine
But I'll wait forever
I'll wait for your heart
And you'll let me wait too
All you have to say is we'll be together
And I'd wait for you

If this doesn't end I 'll hold on forever
Waiting for a girl to make good on her word
So I have to stop
Or I'll wait forever
Forever for you
Forever for you
Forever for you
Forever for you
