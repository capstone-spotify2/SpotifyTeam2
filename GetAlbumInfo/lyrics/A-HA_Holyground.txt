Take your pride
and lift it high
I've come to say goodbye

You've got your live
And I've got mine
Sometimes hard to draw that line

I like to walk
And my way is my own
You taught me how
Don't you know

And there must be
some place to meet
I take off my shoes
I'll walk bare-foot when I do

Standing there in front of you
I want to honest
I want to be true

I like to walk
And my way is my own
You taught me how
Don't you know what we found

Brother maybe

We're on holy ground
Take your pride
and lift it high

I must leave without you
Good advice I grow stronger
Where the mountains rise

Standing there in front of you
I want to honest
I want to be true

In front of you
