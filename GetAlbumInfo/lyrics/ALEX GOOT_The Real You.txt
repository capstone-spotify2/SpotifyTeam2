I wish the music would carry me away
'cause I don't wanna be stuck down here
And I wonder what I did this time
Could I be so cavalier?

You know the lyrics and I know the melody
So sing along, we'll write a song about you
Don't have to wonder if you feel the same
'cause I know that you do

'cause I need this now, you need this too
Why should we wait on anything at all?
The way the light swims across your face
How could I dream of anything but

The real you
Yeah, the real you
Ooh

Could it be that we met at the wrong time?
How am I supposed to live with that?
Always feeling like around the corner, he's gonna come back

'cause I need you, know you feel it too
Why should we wait on anything at all?
The way the light swims across your face
how could I dream of anything but

The real you
Yeah, the real you
Ooh

You know it's taken my pride, yeah
And now I'm frantic inside, yeah
And what if we met at the wrong time?
What if we met at the wrong time?

You know it's taken my pride
Now I'm frantic inside
I know that I can't get over it
And what if we met at the wrong time?

You know it's taken my pride
Now I'm frantic inside
I know that I can't get over you
I know that my dreams will never do
'cause I just need the real you

The real you
Ooh, the real you
Ooh, the real you
Ooh, the real you, yeah

Ooh, the real you
Ooh, the real you
Ooh, the real you, yeeh
