I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
(This boy cries)

I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me, but I'm seeing through your lies
It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries
(This boy cries)

I never thought I could cry for you
But honey I will miss you 'til the day I die
('Til the day I die)

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
(This boy cries, this boy cries)
