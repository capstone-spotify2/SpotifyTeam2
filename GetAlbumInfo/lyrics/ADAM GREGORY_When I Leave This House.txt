Just like Cain &amp; Able
I let the devil come 'round
Now I'm the king of the garden
With a snake for a crown
When the lord points his finger 
Baby I'm goin' down
Well, I'm no Hells Angel
But I like to pretend I'm the king of the highway 
On the prairie wind 
With a black leather soul
I'm gonna ride to the bitter end, here we go 
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back 
Tie my sins to a railroad track 
Carve my initials with chicken scratch 
The Garden of Eden hasn't broken my back
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back 
Well, hey now mama 
Don't let your love dry up 
I'm a hungry child
With an empty cup 
You can't feed your babies 
When you're all shook up, 
yeah
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back 
When I leave this house, 
I ain't coming back 
Tie my sins to a railroad track
Carve my initials with chicken scratch
The Garden of Eden hasn't broken my back 
When I leave this house, 
I ain't coming back
Well, I'm no Hells Angel
But I like to pretend I'm the king of the highway
On the prairie wind 
With a black leather soul I'm gonna ride to the bitter end
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back
Tie my sins to a railroad track
Carve my initials with chicken scratch
The Garden of Eden hasn't broken my back
When I leave this house, 
I ain't coming back
When I leave this house, 
I ain't coming back
When I leave this house,
I ain't coming back 
Tie my sins to a railroad track 
Carve my initials with chicken scratch 
The Garden of Eden hasn't broken my back
When I leave this house, 
I ain't coming back
