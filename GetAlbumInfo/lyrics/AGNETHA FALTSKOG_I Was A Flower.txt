Careless hands, reckless heart
Tore me from the ground
I followed you
Like a river follows the sea

Hollow dreams, precious pride
A blossom by your side
I followed you
You were everything to me

But now you walk right through me
Like I'm an empty ghost
Now, when I need you the most

I was a flower
Now look at what you've done
You've made my colours fade
Too close to the sun
Once I was innocent
Beautiful, life had just begun
I was a flower
Now look what you have done

Crazy nights, wicked ways
I wither in the haze
Followed you, till I followed you too far
I needed you, your face was kind
I trusted you, my faith was blind
Now I don't know who you are

I was a flower
Now look at what you have done
You've made my colours fade
Too close to the sun
Once I was innocent
Beautiful, life had just begun
I was a flower
Now look what you have done

But now you walk right through me
Like I'm an empty ghost
Now, when I need you the most

I was a flower
Now look at what you have done
You made my colours fade
Too close to the sun
Once I was innocent
Beautiful, life had just begun
I was a flower
Now look what you have done
(Now look what you have done)
Now look what you have done
(Now look what you have done)

Careless hands, reckless heart
My life had just begun
Now look what you have done
