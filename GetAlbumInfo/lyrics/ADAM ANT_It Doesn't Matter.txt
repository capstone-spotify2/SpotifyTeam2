I'm sick of coming home and watching TV
I just can't stand it when you sit next to me

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
I'll get by with another
B-b-baby go to hell

Our perspiration's brought the wallpaper down
I just can't stand it when you walk into town

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
'Cos I'll get by with another
B-b-baby go to (like this)

There's so much trouble when we go for a bite
They say the food is off and they start to fight

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
I'll get by with another
B-b-baby you - 
Yes you do you -
Oh oh oh oh oh you -
Like this

I'd like to kiss you baby, fall for your charms
But that's all over when you lift up your arms
