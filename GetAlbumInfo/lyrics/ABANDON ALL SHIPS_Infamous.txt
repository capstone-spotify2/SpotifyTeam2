Born and raised original,
You're just TV typical.
You think I'm just a gimmick?
From east to west you pussies mimic.
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know,
Is this city, throw it up,
Toronto.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.

Rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I'm not.
Fuck yeah, I have an ego, but you would too.
If you had what I got,
But we embrace, all of this hate.
Bitch you're 15 minutes late.
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know,
Is this city, throw it up,
Toronto.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.
<i>[Repeat]</i>

<i>[A-Game:]</i>
They only see us when they look up.
It's kinda lonely where we've been standing.
But we got perfect view that's HD, wait 7D, Canon.
That's flashing lights in my past life.
Pilot mode about to take flight.
Paparazzi where we go, cool boyz you can blame it on my ego.
She say I got her wetter then Nemo.
I work for everything I need so,
I need more, a bad bitch, brains with a 4. average
They will see us when they look up.

And you know we killing this shit,
And you know we about to take over,
I advise you Abandon All Ships.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.
<i>[Repeat]</i>

If you don't like us, fuck you.
Forever Lonley Crew.
FLC ain't running.
UO is rising.
You're with us, or against us.
AAS is coming.
New York's running.
LA's running.
Yeah, you should be fucking scared.
Toronto's coming.
