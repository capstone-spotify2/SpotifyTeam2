Some girls want to play with you
Doing things that they really can't do
They think that love is a game to play
They oughta know that I get my way.

They look at you with starry eyes
Very soon they all realize
Play with fire and your fingers burn
I wanna tell them, they never learn.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, oh baby you know
There's a special kind of love
There's something magic when we touch.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, I just couldn't hide
All the love I feel inside
I want you with me, by my side,
By my side.

I never dreamed I would stay with you
Just one look, and I knew you were true
One more day and I woke up to find
I couldn't think, you were on my mind.

I can't believe those other guys
Hanging round with that look in their eyes
They'll never know what I get from you
I wanna tell them, I never do.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, oh baby you know
There's a special kind of love
There's something magic when we touch.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, I just couldn't hide
All the love I feel inside
I want you with me, by my side,
By my side, by my side, by my side.

Play with fire and your fingers burn
I wanna tell them, they never learn.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, oh baby you know
There's a special kind of love
There's something magic when we touch.

I won't let you go, no no no
I'll never let go, I just couldn't hide
All the love I feel inside
I want you with me, by my side
I won't let you go....
