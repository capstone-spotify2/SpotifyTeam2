<i>[Boys Sing]</i>
You spend your money on diamonds and pearls
I'd sell my car (just) to travel the world
I look broke baby - you got flash
But even so we're a perfect match

You're into fashion, dinners and art
I know the south park series by heart
You conversate baby - I talk trash
But even so we're a perfect match

<i>[Girls Sing]</i>
We're like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
When I say this - you say that
But love comes easy 'cause opposites attract

<i>[Boys Sing]</i>
You keep your clothes looking crispy &amp; clean
(alt.keep your clothes so fresh and so clean)
I got holes all over my jeans
You love "Grease" baby - I love "Snatch"
But even so we're a perfect match

<i>[Girls Sing]</i>
We're like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
When I say this - you say that
But love comes easy 'cause opposites attract

I know - we'll beat the odds together
We'll keep our love intact - and prove that opposites attract
