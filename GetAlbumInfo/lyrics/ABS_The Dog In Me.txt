Tickbooty with dat full black thang? Damn! 
<i>[Abs:]</i> It's just the dog in me. 
Got a hold of my cool side... 
It's telling me.

<i>[Abs:]</i> See I didn't wanna act too fast, 
Wanted to take it slow. 
But the dog said NO. 
<i>[Electronic Abs:]</i> Boy, you better fix up man!

<i>[Abs:]</i> And girl I didn't mean to touch your ass 
You wouldn't even if I told you, believe me.. oh!

Zoom in the foam back seat of the Ranger Rover 
<i>[Abs:]</i> She's telling me, slow down 
Take it slowly
