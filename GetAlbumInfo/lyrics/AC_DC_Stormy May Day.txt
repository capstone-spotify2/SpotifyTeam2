The storm is raging
Winds are howling
The water's calling, rescue you
A flash of lightning
At times a'frightnin'
A wind is coming
And the sun don't shine

Rain day
May day
May day
Stormy Rain Day
Rain day
May day
May day
Stormy Rain Day
Stormy May Day

The sky is darkening
The dogs are barking
A call for help
You hope they get you through
A clap of thunder
A split asunder
The people running
And the moon doth rise

Rain day
May day
May day
Stormy Rain Day
Rain day
May day
Rain day
Stormy May Day
Rain day
May day
Rain day
Stormy May Day
