On the way to the heaven's light
Where the time doesn't matter
You're so fine
Take my hand
Put me on the top of the world

On the way to the heaven's light
You were hiding behind the moon
You're so fine
You walk in my mind
Put me on the top of the world

On the way to the heaven's light
Things go up things go down
Our love stays around
Put me on the top of the world
On the way to the heaven's light
On the way to the heaven's light
