I preyed on human nature.
I took this innocence alive.
I prayed through the allegations.
Deliver me from the fire.
And I feel no remorse.
Take me to the gallows.

Text book psycho, analyze my shame.
He took the innocence away.
And I vowed to watch you die.
Take him to the gallows.

Excommunicate.
Hang the beast.
Show no mercy in the God-damn killing.
Excommunicate.
I'm in love with feeling nothing for life.

Father and your precious values.
Sewn together breathing infinite defeat.
And theres no chance for a cover up.
Take him to the gallows.

Excommunicate.
Hang the beast.
Show no mercy in the God-damn killing.
Excommunicate.
I'm in love with feeling nothing for life.

One voice to children.
One chance to save us all.
One voice to kill them.
One chance to save us all.
One voice to a million.
One chance to save us all.
