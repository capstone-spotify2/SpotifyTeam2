<i>[Verse:]</i>
Your cruel device,
Your blood like ice,
One look could kill,
My pain your thrill,

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I wanna love you but I better not touch,
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop,
I wanna kiss you but I want it to much,
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Poison,
Your poison running through my veins,
Poison,
No I donât wanna break these chains.

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Your mouth so hard,
Your win Iâm caught,
Your skin so wet,
Black lace on sweat,

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I hear you calling and its needles and pins,
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name,
Donât wanna touch you but youâre under my skin, 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Poison,
Your poison running through my veins
Poison
No I donât wanna break these chains.
Poison

<i>[Verse:]</i>
One look could kill,
My pain your thrill

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I wanna love you but I better not touch,
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop,
I wanna kiss you but I want it to much,
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Poison,
Your poison running through my veins,
Poison,
No I donât wanna break these chains.
Poison, running deep inside my veins <i>[x2]</i>
