I may be ten years old but I still know what's up.
I wear my Cramps shirt almost
every single day. I want to sag my pants.
I want to pogo dance, but Mom won't let me so I might just run away.
I wanna ride my skate. I wanna stay out late.
I wanna mohawk but mom won't let me get one.
I wanna go to shows.
Don't wanna pierce my nose.
I wanna get a mohawk but mom won't let me get one.
I may be in fourth grade, but I know what's going on.
I listen to the Misfits almost every single day.
Don't want to take a nap, I want a TV tat,
but Mom won't let me so I might just disobey.
