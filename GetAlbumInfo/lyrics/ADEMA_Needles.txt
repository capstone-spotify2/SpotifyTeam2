To Live, Do you want to... Live!? 
Do you wanna live? 
Do you wanna live? 
Do you want to live? 

I know this girl with a needle in her arm
The red dragon walking circles through her soul
She chases dragon to apiece the track upon her soul
She cooked the shit twice today to shut out the pain

I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
There's nothing left 
But blood stains

The tracks you have they tell the tale, 
Of what your hell on earth would feel
Do you want to live? Do you want to live? 
Let the needle fly away remove it from your life
Do you wanna live or do you want to die

I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
There's nothing left 
But blood stains

When it all comes down, does the one thing end your life 
And you make the world that we hate inside 
Everything, is crying on me, it's gone, I've become your god

I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
There's nothing left 
But blood stains
