Lightning in a bottle
Fish in the stream
You in all your glory's
What I need

You got a gambler's grin
In the glow of the match
Hard as steel
And as soft as ash

Oh no...Tell me are you really like a sparrow in a hurrican

It's like lightning in a bottle
Fish on the line
Tell me a story
Read my mind

I don't want
Waste my time
Tell me will it be your world
Or will it be mine, mine, mine

Oh no...Tell me are you ready like a sparrow in a hurrican
Whoa no...Are you prepared for a walk in the naked rain

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I would crawl, you know, you know I'd swim
I'd climb a mountain baby, I'd dive right in
Do the monkey, do the fly
Take a chance on comin' back for another life
One more time

It's like lightning in a bottle
Fish in a stream
You in all your glory's
What I need

Dogs are in the field
Moon floats on the lake
This is all too good
To be a big mistake

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh no...Tell me are you ready like a sparrow in a hurrican
Whoa no...Are you prepared for a walk in the naked rain

<i>[Chorus]</i>
