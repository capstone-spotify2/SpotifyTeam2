This is the place where nobody comes from
Perfect strangers in this desert town
Just out of flame and looking for favours
Hungry players when the deals go down

You get a hollow heart from shallow breathing
And a see-through smile like the ones on T.V.
This is the land of thrills and money where you
Hit the edge and you drift out to sea

It seems so real, looks so good
But you'd give it all up and you'd start again if you thought you could
And it sounds so sweet, feels so right
But it leaves you cold in the middle of the night

Step right up, lay your money down
If you're looking to buy love in the big town
Lift you up, tear you down
Leave you begging for more love in the big town

Down in the street with the waiters and mystics
When you got faith in nothing, you just fantasize
You look for a flame but you'd fall for a flicker
In those angel faces and those cowboy eyes

They seem so real and they look so good
And with a bit of persuasion you really believe you know you could
Tastes so sweet, feels so right
But it leaves you cold in the heart of the night

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Step right up, (lay your) money down
If you're looking to find love in the big town
Lift you up, tear you down
They'll leave you begging for more love in the big town

Oh you learn to use all your desperation
Till it works its way into your soul
Then you find out that you slowly lose control

<i>[Chorus repeats 2x]</i>
