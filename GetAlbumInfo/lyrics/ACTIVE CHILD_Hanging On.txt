You know we can get away 
Because I'm calling your name 
Every day I feel this pain 
But you just turn and walk away 

I just can't keep hanging on 
To you and me 
I just don't know what is wrong 
With you and me 

Touch me and then turn away 
Put your hands into the flame 
Tell me if you feel this pain 
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain 

I just can't keep hanging on 
To you and me 
I just don't what is wrong 
With you and me 
With you and me 

I just can't keep hanging on 
To you and me 
I just don't know what is wrong 
I just can't keep hanging on 
To you and me 
I just don't know what is wrong
