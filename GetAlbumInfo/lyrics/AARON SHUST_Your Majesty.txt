Jesus, Alpha and Omega
Lord of all creation
Beginning and the End

Spirit, ever present comfort
Granting us a peace
We could never comprehend

Jesus, conqueror of sin
With the power to rise again
You're the victor over death

Savior, Holy as You are
You removed our sin as far
As the east is from the west

Jesus, King of every king
The One who reigns in majesty
Sovereign God, Maker of every galaxy
Seated high on Your throne
The One who reigns inside of me
God who saves, we proclaim Your majesty

Jesus, equal to the Father
Glory, praise and honor
Majesty and power

Never leaving or forsaking
Inhabiting our praises
In this very hour

And we have come to lift You up
We have come to lift You up
We bow before You
We adore You God
We adore You God
