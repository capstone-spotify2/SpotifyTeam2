Drivin' in my car
Headed for the local bar
Pickin' up my girl tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Shootin' pool with my friends
Smokin' cigarettes
Tellin' jokes out loud
We're laughing way too proud

And we rock it
And we roll it
And we're laughing
And we're joking
And we roll it
Baby we roll it, roll it,
We won't get the blues because we

Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day

And when I'm on the way back home
I listen to the radio
I hear some great rock sounds
That make you wanna sing out loud

And we rock it
And we roll it
And we're laughing
And we're joking
And we roll it
Baby we're rockin' and rollin',
We won't get the blues because we

Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day

Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day, yeah yeah
Rock the blues away
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
