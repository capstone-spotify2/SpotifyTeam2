Well I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky 
Yes I had a dream 
I stood beneath an orange sky 
With my brother standing by 
With my brother standing by 
I said, "Brother, you know you know 
It's a long road we've been walking on 
Brother, you know it is you know it is 
Such a long road we've been walking on." 

And I had a dream 
I stood beneath an orange sky 
With my sister standing by 
With my sister standing by 
I said, "Sister, here is what I know now 
Here is what I know now 
Goes like this.. 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, in your love, in your love."

"But sister you know I'm so weary 
And you know, sister 
My heart's been broken 
Sometimes, sometimes 
My mind is too strong to carry on 
Too strong to carry on"

"When I am alone 
When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone 
When I've lost all care for the things I own 
That's when I miss you, that's when I miss you, that's when I miss you 
You who are my home 
You who are my home 
And here is what I know now 
Here is what I know now 
Goes like this.. 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, my salvation lies 
In your love, in your love, in your love"

Well I had a dream 
I stood beneath an orange sky 
Yes I had a dream 
I stood beneath an orange sky 
With my brother and my sister standing by 
With my brother and my sister standing by 
With my brother and my sister standing by
