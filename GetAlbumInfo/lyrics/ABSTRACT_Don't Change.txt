Remember back when dreaming bout the life, we didn't realize that to get there there'd be sacrifice,
we didn't take into account the craziness of life, remember setting up those speakers calibrating lights,
hoping that our friends would come support us for the night, had maybe 20 in the crowd we thought we owned the world,
look at me now like I was stunting on my old girl, heard she came through for a bit I was like word,
Jalaya moved to San Fran now he's takin over, Mickey and Jason moved to Aspen their life started over,
but when we talk these days don't feel a day has passed, still the same sand within that hour glass,
Austin wish I saw you more I'm happy that your doing good, over due for a team reunion we probably should,
know it ain't what we had all planned but it's workin out, turns out change is all you can be certain bout

Don't change, Don't Change, Don't Change, even though life ain't the same, and they say don't change, don't change, don't change,
life gon make it happen anyway, and I say don't change, don't change, don't change,even though life ain't the same,
and they say don't change, don't change, don't change, but no matter what you do it gon happen anyway

Fans hit me up on message, tell me never change, but I think what they mean isn't what they say,
I'll always be same kid speaking from his heart, the one who steps into the lab all to push the art,
who steps into his mind just to pick it all apart, the extroverted introvert who's puzzled by the earth,
caught between who he is and what he does for worth, hope when I'm gone you spread my message don't just put me on a shirt,
and if you come up out my small town hope you know I did it first, No hate to those before me I just really made it work,
no one put me on barely down to let me open, now I'm everyday gettin closer to my moment, don't you get it twisted road I took was never golden,
shit was frozen I was slip sliding steady through emotions, gave my heart to passion even after passion broke it that's real

Don't change, Don't Change, Don't Change, even though life ain't the same, and they say don't change, don't change, don't change,
life gon make it happen anyway, and I say don't change, don't change, don't change,even though life ain't the same,
and they say don't change, don't change, don't change, but no matter what you do it gon happen anyway

My whole life is on a rise, shit I wrote down I'm seeing with my eyes, this some shit I used to dream about,
what I was plotting with the team about, shout to all my friends that saw the magic in my vision,
the ones who let the kid know they still riding wit em, so put your seat belts on we bout to take off, got the word from ground control time for lift off
