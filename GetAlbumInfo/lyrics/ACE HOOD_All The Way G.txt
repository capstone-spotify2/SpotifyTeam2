I respect it like a real OG
Few racks and the gun on me, I keep that shit on me
Why these lames wanna shit on me? Wanna see a nigga RIP
Keep it all the way G
I'm a do it like a young Ali
You know the boy don't need ID, I do it BIG
I thank God everyday I see
I keep it all the way G

<i>[Verse:]</i>
I'm a shine cause I know they mad
Middle finger, tell them kiss my ass
When I was on my last, they was talking 'bout the boy so bad
You know damn well that shit won't pass
Never trip on that, young nigga had to jump right back
Real niggas know that this all facts
I gotta keep my strap, sick and tired of being stabbed in the back
For the cheese, gotta feed to the rats
I was only 18, 100 G's, in that brand new 'lac
Told my city that I'd be right back
I just can't relax, fuck that, ain't cut no slack
Fuck a defense, I run through sacks, I got my mojo back
Hood Nation, the time is now
Heard some people tryna calm us down, I want them commas now
Good Lord, man this dough's allowed
Think it's funny when them hoes around
All this ice on my neck and my collar
Had a dream and a dollar, never seen as a scholar
Shit, more money, more problems
Came with a crazy baby mama
Don't really get no sleep
I been up late thinking of the ways to eat
Cause my team and my kids, they depend on me
I depend on them, we depend on us
Got me riding through the city, only God I trust
Came a long way from my mama driving a bus
Couldn't name 'nother niggas that was louder than us
Name ring in my city in case they calling a bluff
As I walk through the valley and the shadow of death
Tryna squeeze all the juice outta life itself
Had to get this shit right at the time I left
They don't wanna see you win, you can save your breath
On a motherfucking mission of redemption
The devil calling and I'm tryna resist it
I gotta smile every time I see the wrist lit
They tryna shut a nigga out, I been a misfit
I been praying, praying, praying, praying
Hennessy and kush demand
Out by the live show
Ace why you never by them rap gods?
How you never in the media? You mad underrated
When them suckers nigga really gon' realise?
I'm just a different breed
Ain't no in between
I'm the quiet type
Flow on a dope pipe
Shining like a strobe light
I won't roll back

I respect it like a real OG
