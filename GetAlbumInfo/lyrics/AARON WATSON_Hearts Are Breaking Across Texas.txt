The words cannot express, the way you look in that white dress
I don't believe theres ever been such a beautiful sight.
All my dreams are coming true, that yellow rose ain't got nothing on you
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight.

And tears will be falling everywhere, as your lettin down your hair
From cowboys wishin, that it was them holding you tight
Well thats the harsh reality, Id feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
The lone star is shining bright above, and theres magic in the air
But looking deep into your eyes, I cant help but sympathize
For those who will never know, the kind of love we share

And tears will be falling everywhere, as your lettin down your hair
From cowboys wishin, that it was them holding you tight
Well thats the harsh reality, Id feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
Yes Hearts are breaking across Texas
