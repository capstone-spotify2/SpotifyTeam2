"Hey Soul"
"Wassup G G"
"I finally figured out..."
"Thank God for girls"
"God's a girl"

(God's a girl, God's a girl, God's)
I ain't gon' lie, you got me cryin' with a hard dick (amen)
How I love you so much that I hate this shit?
I get it get it, I (don't stop)
You ain't doin' your job if you don't say (oh, my god)
Come have sex with Jesus
Come have sex with Jesus (Soulo)
Come have sex with Jesus
You ain't doin' your job if you don't say (oh, my god)

Every single time, yeah
And all I got is goddesses, I'm a heroine addict..
That's it, that's it
Yeah cause I.. I really wanted to talk about like
You know, it's crazy how you know like you know, how Jesus is in the bible and he don't get no pussy at all
A 33 year old virgin
Yeah it's crazy
Like all the drugs are girls
Mary, Molly
Yeah for real, they're all named after girls
And they're really like female plants and shit

Yes Lord (Black Lip Pastor)
We in Frankies castle with the pack though
Motherfucking pack
Top want me to go to rehab
Told him I would go too
Probably just relapse
Cause that's what ill niggas do
Won't even pop a bottle without poppin a pill
Can't have a meal without picking up the bill
Should be more concerned with my health
But I'm gonna die trying to get this wealth
Pay attention nigga
I've been going platinum, they just trying to take it
Fuck boys acting up, like an adult film audition
I'm just eating these rappers up
Sending artists to the mortician
I'm just with my niggas hanging, case of champagne
Need some water but I'd rather me a martyr for the cause
Nigga y'all niggas still don't get it
Juvenile never went to juvenile hall
It was 400 degrees on terminals
The homies playing with the strap off safety
And my lady at the time she stayed on gun lock
The irony in that alone is crazy
I come up with shit like that that's why they say I'm crazy
Maybe
I'm with the shits, I'm off the shits
(YMF)
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
But I guarantee she make it to the penthouse naked
You niggas been outdated
Like the bitches I dated way way way way back when
Now I'm getting brain in the tenant's Maybach Benz
It's rented but I'm in it nigga
I didn't pay back
More insufficient funds in the last 5 months than you gonna make in this whole year
On the mountain top about to cry cause it gets so lonely up here
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?
In this jaded generation of complacency siri don't even take us seriously
But that's some other shit just being honest with you
Right hand on the bible with you
My ancestors came on the mothership
So I got to take it farther nigga that makes sense

My head in the clouds
Getting head in the clouds
By an angel in disguise
She an angel in disguise
D'evils gonna be my demise
I swear that God's a girl, bitch
