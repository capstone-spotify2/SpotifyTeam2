I know people who lose their lovers
Turn around and they find another
Fall in love and then they break up
But I don't know if I want to wake up

'Cause I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby
I'm still dreamin'
Whoa, about you

Other women walk right up to me
I hear them talking but it goes right through me
I know its love that's on the line
But they don't know what's on my mind
'Cause I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby
I'm still dreamin'
Whoa, about you

It's like a voice that's always calling
It's like a feeling that I'm always falling
I close my eyes and all I see is you, you, you
'Cause I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby
I'm still dreamin'
Whoa, about you
(Key Change)
I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby
I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby
Dreamin' about you baby
I'm still dreamin'
Keep on dreamin' about you baby
I'm still dreamin'
I'm still dreamin', baby...
