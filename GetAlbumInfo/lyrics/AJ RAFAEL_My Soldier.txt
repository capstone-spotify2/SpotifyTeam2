When you're feeling sad and blue
Don't you know that I will always be here for you
When everything just makes us go out of our mind
Just know that I will always have the time for you
You say that I am your influence
You should know that you inspire me, now until the end
I'll help you get through the thick and thin
And I know you'll remember when, I say...

You are strong strong as a soldier
Even when winds are tough you'll always keep it together.
You are strong, strong as a soldier
I know you'll get through anything
'Cause you're strong, strong, strong as a soldier.

When the waves are crashing down, can't get up
Just know I'll pick you up from the ground
When it feels like everything goes wrong,
Just remember to listen to this song

You are strong strong as a soldier
Even when winds are tough you'll always keep it together.
You are strong, strong as a soldier
I know you'll get through anything
'Cause you're strong, strong, strong as a soldier.

Don't you worry about the obstacles to your happiness
If you let them get to you, you'll endure just like the rest.
I know you're better than those people who get in the way
Just remember what I always say...

You are strong strong as a soldier
Even when winds are tough you'll always keep it together.
You are strong, strong as a soldier
I know you'll get through anything
'Cause you're strong, strong, strong as a soldier.

You are strong, strong, strong as a soldier
Strong, strong, strong as a soldier
