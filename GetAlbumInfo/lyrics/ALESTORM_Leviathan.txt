Legend speaks of a beast
Three hundred miles from its tip to its tail
None have seen it, yet all know its name
Like the ark of the covenant, or the holy grail

We set out on a quest
In search of the lair, where the creature doth dwell
On a ransom to bring back its head
Our journey would take us to the depths of hell

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim

The skies turned to black
The oceans fell dead, no winds dared to blow
Then out the darkness with a thunderous roar
Leviathan rose up from the depths below

Cannons fired, and swords tasted blood
As the beast turned to strike with rage in its eyes
From its mouth came a great ball of flame
It was then we all knew, that the end was nigh

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame
His nostrils seethe with fumes of brimstone
He is the beast that can't be tamed

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim
