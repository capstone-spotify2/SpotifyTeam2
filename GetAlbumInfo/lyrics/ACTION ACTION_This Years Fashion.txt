Don't cut your fabric to this years fashion

Head trip on the scene again, pumping in the veins of the rabid mouths to feed.
Head back, obsolete...trapped with the secrets that i can not keep today

Head spun by a thousand spiders, sucked into their late night infomercials
Rolled back with every beat, bound to the bond on a greater feature feat

You got it
Intrusive
Errattic
Elusive
Your heart aches
Infliction
Sporadic in an aging contradiction

I have a dream
It's them and not me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my
Sugar my life,
Sweaten my tea
You lied, you lied, you lied
You've got your hands around my throat
You've got your eyes inside my back
You lied, you lied, oh my
