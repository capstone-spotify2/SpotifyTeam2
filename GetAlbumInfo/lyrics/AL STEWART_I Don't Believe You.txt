I can't understand
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall.

I'd sure like to know
Why did she go, but then
I can't get close to her at all.

Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she'd never forget.

But now morning is clear
Its like I ain't here
She acts like we never have met.

Its all new to me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth.

Yes its hard to think on
That she's the same one
That only last night I was with.

From darkness dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?

Oh, I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of acting like we never met.

If she ain't feeling well
Well then why don't she tell
'Stead of turning her back to my face.

Mmm, without any doubt
She just seems too far out
For me to return to or chase.

Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet.

But evidently she don't
Evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met.

If I didn't have to guess
I'd gladly confess
To anything I might have tried

If I was working too long
Or have done something wrong
Wish she'd say what it is I'll run and hide.

Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet

But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met.

Mmmm, I'm leaving today
Gotta be on my way
Of this I can't say too much.

But if you want me to
I can be just like you
retend that we never have touched.

And if anybody should ask me
Is it easy to forget?

Why its easily done
You just pick anyone
Pretend that you never have met.
