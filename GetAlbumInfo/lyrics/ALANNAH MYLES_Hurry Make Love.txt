Don't leave me at home too long
Don't let me pur sleep unsung
Don't stay up with your damn TV
Somebody else might make love to me

Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me
Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me

I don't believe in lyin' low
I don't watch all that tall grass grow
Don't believe in darnin' socks
I just believe in love talks

Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me
Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me now
Hmm hmm

Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me
Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me

Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me, to me ohh
Hurry, hurry, hurry make love to me
