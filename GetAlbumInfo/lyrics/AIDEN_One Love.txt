When I wake, I see you
Lying there on the bathroom floor
With foam lips, a black kiss
You're dead heroine, I miss
The way you look so nice
We'll save the undead princess
I'm anxiously awaiting your arrival now

One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid

The demon, your ghost eyes
Watching me run through our lives
A soft look, in silence
Misery come and find us
Well don't try to stop me
I'm headed straight to hell down
I want you, I need you now

One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid

The last night, you were here
Your words were so meaningful
with reprise we'll suffer
I thought your ruse was so fake {now}

One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes
Beyond human aid
One love, in your eyes
Beyond human aid
One love
