There's a thousand miles and eighteen hours I've got a double drive down southbound 35
Got the hammer down, detroit made 525 pushing' my ass right down that line
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road

I've got a full-grown creeping' up on my tail, no I won't make bail in this small town jail no not right here
I've got the bird dog on, radio cranked, gear jammin lane changin son of a bitch you betcha son
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road

Just left the jail with a handful of pills and I won't quit til I hit the coup in Abiline
I'm almost there, there's just a few more miles, I'll make the drop, I'll turn and burn I'm outta here
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
