Alright

You're a sexy bitch
And you know it too
You make 'em watch everything you do
When I see the play I'm gonna make me blast
You look so fiesty, let me feel your past

It's worth the risk
Little miss
I'm gonna take the shot

You're a bombshell
And you blow me away
You're a bombshell
When you blow me away
Yeah, you blow me away
Bombshell
Bombshell
Yeah, you blow me away
Bombshell
Bombshell
Alright

You break my neck
When I turn to look
You make me shout
For the - you took

But you won't let me
Like chocolate in your mouth
Starting to melt

It's worth the risk
Little miss
I'm gonna take the shot

You're a bombshell
And you blow me away
You're a bombshell
When you blow me away
Yeah, you blow me away
Bombshell
Bombshell
Yeah, you blow me away
Bombshell

Yeah, you blow me away

Bombshell

Bombshell
Oh, bombshell
You kill me
You rob me
You burn me but I'm okay

You're a bombshell
And you blow me away
You're a bombshell
When you blow me away
You're a bombshell
And you blow me away
You're a bombshell
When you blow me away
Yeah, you blow me away
Bombshell

You blow me away
Blow me away
