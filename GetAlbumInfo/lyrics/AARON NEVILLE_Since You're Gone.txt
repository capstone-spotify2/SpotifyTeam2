Since you're gone with your guy
I feel as though I want cry
But a man ant supposed to shed a tear
If only you were here (you've gone away baby), if only you were here (you've gone away baby)

If only if you were here I'd lie for you, darling I'd die for you
Please say you're coming home

Since you've gone away
Been working hard while you're at play
Never thinking that you are untrue
Didn't worry over you

So long, this is goodbye
I didn't want you to leave me, but I've got my pride
There's one thing I want you to know
Girl I love you so (you've gone away baby), girl I love you so (you've gone away baby)
You've gone away (you've gone away baby)
So long (you've gone away baby)
Oh my darling, so long
