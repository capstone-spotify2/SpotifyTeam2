The ground under my feet,
Never stays stud still.
But listen to my heartbeat
Itâs never gonna change.
Now that dark becomes bright,
Right becomes wrong, calm becomes storm
Through the thunder or rain
Breaking winds I can still hear.

You said youâd never seen a heartbeat
You donât have to hesitate
And Iâll keep coming
You just have to say heart rate
Ah aaah aaah ah ah
Ah aaah aaah ah ah

Angels become devils,
Strangers become lovers.
And now itâs crazy outside
Nowhere to hide, skies are falling.
Through the thunder or rain
Breaking winds I can still hear.

You said youâd never seen a heartbeat
You donât have to hesitate
And Iâll keep coming
You just have to say heart rate
Ah aaah aaah ah ah
Ah aaah aaah ah ah

Dark becomes bright,
Right becomes wrong,
Calm becomes storm
I can still hear.

You said youâd never seen a heartbeat
You donât have to hesitate
And Iâll keep coming
You just have to say heart rate
Ah aaah aaah ah ah
Ah aaah aaah ah ah
