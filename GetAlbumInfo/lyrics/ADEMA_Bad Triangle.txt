It's Real Life mixed with Adema get your bite from hanging on a tightrope
To survive you gotta be a dreamer I come to fight my nigga go psycho
We could go live in the arena, tight hold to your windpipe make your mind slow
Say goodnight thanks to Adema I chose taking my time so you die slow

You're still barely breathing, Heaven not below. where is your mind?
You've been caught in a bad triangle, your life's on the line, where is your mind?

It's Real Life

It starts with your mouth running that lip, stop that unless you wanna see me drop that (drop that)
You found in a cloud it ain't worth shit, talk back and you gonna see me cock back (cock back)
Leave any doubt at home with your kids, that you fought back like Bush fought in Iraq
The time is now so just quit, or get tapped by the man with the high drop take that

You're still barely breathing, Heaven not below. where is your mind?
You've been caught in a bad triangle, your life's on the line, where is your mind?
It's just a matter of time, now I have control. You know where to go
