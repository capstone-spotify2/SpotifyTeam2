Can you see me baby 
Standing in the light 
I feel your cat's eyes on me 
Faster in the night
I move inside
Got those eyes 
Something's burning baby 
That's alright
You and I 
Here tonight 

Meet me on the other side
'Cause you can do me right 
Take me where I cannot hide 
'Cause you can do me right 
Meet me on the other side
You don't know me girl
I'm faceless in the crowd 
The things I could show you baby 
Come on, come onto my cloud 
I'm alive tonight 
Something's falling baby 
You and I 
Out of the sky I can see it in your eyes 

Meet me on the other side
'Cause you can do me right
Take me where I cannot hide
'Cause you can do me right 
You need, baby, you're alive 
'Cause you can do me right 
Take me to the other side
'Cause you can do me right 
Meet me on the other side 

I speak French today baby.
