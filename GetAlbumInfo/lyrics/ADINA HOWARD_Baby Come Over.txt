<i>[Chorus]</i>
Tonight is the night, to make it alright, tonight is the night; Baby come over (baby come over)...
Tonight is the night, to make it alright, tonight is the night; Baby come over (baby come over)...

Here I sit alone on a Saturday night, feeling kinda horny.
Boy I did cool cos I'm missing you
But you're so far away baby, and I need you here by my side
There's so many kinky things we could do tonight.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Baby just a simple touch, the little things mean so much (to me)
I'll do any thing for you, if you ask me to, I'll be there for you.
And baby I know you got a woman at home, we can never be alone to me
But it's alright, cos all I need is tonight; come see about me.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Uuuhhhhhh ... and we can do some kinky things
<i>[spoken:]</i> you know you want to

Let's take our time, baby lets take it nice and slow
Baby I'll do you right, boy I'll make it good to you
All I want to do is make sweet love to you
So don't make me wait too long: Baby come over.

<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
