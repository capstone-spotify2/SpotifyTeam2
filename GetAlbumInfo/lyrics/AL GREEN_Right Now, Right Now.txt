On Monday I had a brand new walk
Yes, I did, yes, I did, yeah
On Tuesday I had a brand new talk
You know I did, baby

But listen, on Wednesday
I was in love with a different girl, yes
On Thursday found myself in a different world, yes, I did

She would run in in my feet
She would clap in in my hands, oh yeah
Started walking, yeah, yeah, yeah, she started talking
Baby, you don't know what she's done to me, said maybe

Right now, right now

Well, look ahead
On Friday said
I won't gonna do nobody, no, no, no
But on Saturday
I couldn't keep it to myself

She would run in in my feet
She would clap in in my hands
She started walking, darling
Started talking yeah, yeah, yeah

She wanna do love, make it good y'all
In my heart, yes, she did
I'm talking about satisfaction in my mind
