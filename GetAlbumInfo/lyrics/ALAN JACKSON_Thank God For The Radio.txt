On the wrong end of the highway
When the long night has no end
When there's no one there beside me
'Til I hold you once again

Thank God for the radio
When I'm on the road
When I'm far from home
And feelin' blue
Thank God for the radio
Playin' all night long
Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you

There's a song that we first danced to
And there's a song they played the night we met
And there's a song we first made love to
That's a song I'll never forget

Thank God for the radio
When I'm on the road
When I'm far from home
And feelin' blue
Thank God for the radio
Playin' all night long
Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you

Thank God for the radio
When I'm on the road
When I'm far from home
And feelin' blue
Thank God for the radio
Playin' all night long
Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you

Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you
Thank God for the radio
