Thereâs a little flame inside us all
Some shine bright, some shine small
The rains will come and the waters rise
But donât you ever lose your light
In this life you will know
Love and pain, joy and sorrow
So when it hurts, when times get hard
Donât forget whose child you are

This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine

May you live each day with no regret
Make the most of every chance you get
Let your eyes get wide when you look at the stars
With the same sense of wonder as a childâs heart
With the ones you love treasure the time
And for those who are gone keep their memories alive
Hold on to your dreams donât ever let go
Thereâs a fire inside you burning with hope

This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine

There will be days when you want to give up
When the clouds settle in
But after the rain comes the sun
Donât you ever forget

One day there will be no more pain
And we will finally see Jesusâ face
So until then Iâm gonna to try
To brave the dark and let my little light shine

This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
Iâm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine

Thereâs a little light inside us all
