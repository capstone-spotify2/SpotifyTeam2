I have a dream
You are there
High above the clouds somewhere
Rain is falling from the sky
But it never touches you
You're way up high

No more worries
No more fears
You have made them disappear
Sadness tried to steal the show
But now it feels like many years ago

And I
I will be with you every step (Hey! Hey!)
Tonight
I found a friend in you
And I'll keep you close forever

Come fly with me (oh-oh oh-oh)
Into a fantasy (oh-oh oh-oh)
Where you can be
Whoever you want to be
Come fly with me

We can fly all day long
Show me the world
Sing me a song
Tell me what the future holds
You and me will paint it all in gold!

And I
I will believe your every word (Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I
I have a friend in you
We'll always stay together

Come fly with me (oh-oh oh-oh)
Into a fantasy (oh-oh oh-oh)
Where you can be
Whoever you want to be
Come fly with me

(Hey!)

And I
I will be with you every step
Tonight
I found a friend in you
And I keep you close forever

Come fly with me
Into a fantasy
Where you can be
Whoever you want to be
Come fly with me

Come fly with me (oh-oh oh-oh)
Into a fantasy (oh-oh oh-oh)
Where you can be
Whoever you want to be
Come fly with me

(Hey!)
