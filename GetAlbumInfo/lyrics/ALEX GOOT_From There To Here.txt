And I canât explain
What itâs like to feel this way
Afraid everything happens
Like a story heard a thousand times
Or a story based on yellow lines

And I canât keep expecting
To run back to home

As days go by
Itâs easier to find your niche
Thereâs so many new faces
And places to see and be in

(oh) I should feel content
No matter where I go
So Iâll have to accept the fact
That I canât stick to where Iâm welcome

Forget everything you knew about your old life
Forget everything you thought you knew at all
âcause you will never see your home again
Youâre stuck where you are

As I packed my things I pleaded not to leave
And I cried myself to sleep
Thinking of departing

We canât keep expecting
To run back to home

(oh) I should feel content
No matter where I go
So Iâll have to accept the fact
That I canât stick to where Iâm welcome

Forget everything you knew about your old life
Forget everything you thought you knew at all
âcause you will never see your home again
Youâre stuck where you are

As days go by
Itâs easier to find your niche
Thereâs so many new faces
And places to see and be in

(oh) I should feel content
No matter where I go
So Iâll have to accept the fact
That I canât stick to where Iâm welcome

Forget everything you knew about your old life
Forget everything you thought you knew at all
âcause you will never see your home again
Youâre stuck where you are
