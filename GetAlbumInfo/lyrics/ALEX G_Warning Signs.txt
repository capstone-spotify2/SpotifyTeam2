There's a girl avoiding reality,
Over and over, losing to gravity.
He's trying pull the lights, so she can't see.
Holding her down, its making it hard to breathe,

Tears fall to the ground,
Again and again, and again, she don't make a sound.

When's she going to realise, 
she's blinded by starried eyes.
She's going down fighting,
Denying the warning signs.
Twisting what she knows is right,
He's going to make her lose her mind,
She's going down fighting,
Denying the warning signs.

She's a soldier, knows when to fall in line,
So good at hiding, caught in a false divide,
Love is weapon, she surely died.
The battle is over, nobody wins this time.

Tears fall to the ground,
Again, and again, and again, she don't make a sound.

When's she going to realise, 
she's blinded by starry'd eyes.
She's going down fighting,
Denying the warning signs.
Twisting what she knows is right,
He's going to make her lose her mind,
She's going down fighting,
Denying the warning signs.

Woah, oh, oh

I tell she can leave him then,
And someday she'll be whole again,
She was made for so much more,

She would just walk out that door,
She would just walk out the door,
If I would just walk out that door,
One last time.

When's she going to realise, 
she's blinded by starried eyes.
She's going down fighting,
Denying the warning signs.
Twisting what she knows is right,
He's going to make her lose her mind,
She's going down fighting
