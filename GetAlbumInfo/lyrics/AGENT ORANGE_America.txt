I'm so bored of education.
I'm so bored of you.
It's such a frustrating situation
And I don't know what to do.
I really wish they'd let me be
To work things out my way.
America's been good to me
But I laugh when people say:

All the kids salute the flag
Uncle Sam wants you
Come on boys lets hear it for the
Red, white, and blue

I'm so bored of television
T.V. dinner on a T.V. tray
Join the Pepsi generation
That's the American way.
Fight for your country,
Fight for survival,
Fight for the fear of war.
Sometimes I wonder who makes the rules
And I wonder who they're making them for.

All the kids salute the flag
Uncle Sam wants you
Come on boys lets hear it for the
Red, white, and blue
