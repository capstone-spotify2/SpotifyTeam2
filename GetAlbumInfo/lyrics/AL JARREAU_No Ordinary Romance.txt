So glad you thought about it 
Sometimes we need to talk about it 
If there's a need please shout it 
I want there to be no doubt that 

This ain't 
No ordinary romance 
And no emotional distress 

By your side I could 
Withstand any pressure 
Oh, it is so hypnotic 
I used to only dream about it 
Now I don't have to doubt it 
Unquestionably sure 
Strong and secure that 

This ain't 
No ordinary romance 
And no emotional distress 

Never believed it could happen to me 
Two people living their lives as one
'cause 

This ain't 
No ordinary romance 
And no emotional distress 

I've got you and you've got me 
And I know it's plain to see that 

This ain't 
No ordinary romance 
And no emotional distress
