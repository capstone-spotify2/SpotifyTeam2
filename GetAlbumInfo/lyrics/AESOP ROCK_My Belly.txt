6AM and I'm dyin' for breakfast
Yawn and stretch then I'm diving for shellfish
Back up at the surface in a second or three
With a trophy Abalone from the depths of the sea
Water front critters in a symphony of sniggers
That's a pretty big meal for a pretty little dipper
How you gonna carry home all that food
I'm a kick back slow and point my toes at the moon
Cause

My Belly is a table
My Belly is a table
When I'm laying on my back
Snack plate upon my navel
Escargot, crab salad on a bagel
My Belly is a table
Say, say say what!?

6PM clam diggin all day
Big fat Belly like the grand buffet
You bobbin with the best back stroke on the river
Potlucks stretch from his throat to his liver
I'm never late for dinner, I make no reservations
All I do is pirouette into a den of celebration
With a delicate maneuver truth be told
My otter pop used to call it the sushi roll
You see...

My Belly is a table
My Belly is a table
When I'm laying on my back
Snack plate upon my navel
Crawdad, cocktail, prawns, basil
My Belly is a table
Say, say say what!?

Shhh shhhh who's making all that noise!
We're trying to sleep!
I'm trying to sleep over here!
Me too, me too, me too
Me too, me too, me too
Who's that?

Twelve o'clock midnight quiet on a beach
Not a creature is stirring they're defiantly asleep
All except one, eyes peeking at the shore
Mind on his stomach and his stomach on more
Slip in to the water where he nestled with the bottom
If he wrestle with the mussel he will render it forgotten
Rise with the take found lights in his face
And the whole wide lake lights like surprise we're awake!
(Surprise yayyyy!)
I hope he caught more than one!
(That'd be great, food, food, foood, food)

My Belly is a table
My Belly is a table
When I'm laying on my back
Snack plate upon my navel
Calamari pan fried scallops and potato
My Belly is a table
Say, say say what!?
Say, say say what!?
Say, say say what!?
