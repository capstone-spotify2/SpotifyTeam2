Hey mister businessman
Head of the company
Are you looking for a lady
One who likes to please
Hey mister businessman
This one likes to tease
With her special service
And her French qualities
But she won't sacrifice
What you want tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
And she's callin' all the shots
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls

Hey mister businessman
High society
She can play the schoolgirl
And spank you all you please
But she won't sacrifice
What you want tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
She don't go overtime
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
Kiss your balls goodbye

Hangin' left, hangin' right, got you by the balls
Got your shorts, got your curlies, got you,
By the balls!

She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls, she got you by the balls

She got you by the balls
