I don't need a heartache 
And crushes can be so fake 
Sooner than you know it 
They turn your world around 

You might think I'm crazy 
When I don't want red roses, yea 
I'd rather have you promise 
To never let me down 

I don't wanna fall in love 
I try and try, but then we get emotional 
Oh I don't need a hit and run 
Don't tell me we were only having fun 

Kinda like your sweet talk 
And that could make a good start 
But if you want to move me oh 
Play it straight with my heart 

I don't wanna fall in love 
I try and try, but then we get emotional 
Oh I don't need a hit and run 
Don't tell me we were only having fun 

So maybe you're the one 
Who gets me going on 
But I'm not waiting for a star to fall 
You gotta treat me right 
And be my knight in white 
That's so emotional 

Mm yeah 
Oh yeah 

Oh oh emotional 
Oh oh emotional 
Oh oh emotional 
So emotional 
Oh yeaah 

I don't wanna fall in love 
I try and try, but then we get emotional 
Oh I don't need a hit and run 
Don't tell me we were only having fun 

I don't wanna fall in love 
I try and try, but then we get emotional 
Oh I don't need a hit and run 
Don't tell me we were only having fun
