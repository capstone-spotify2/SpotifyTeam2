I miss the way you used to say my name
I miss the way you called me just to make sure Iâm ok
And I miss those days that slipped away somehow
Time goes by so fast before you know it then is now

And Iâm constantly reminded
Of another place in time
Why can we just bring it back tonight?

Stay, stay for the weekend
Make it so your eyes
Staring to mine
Would you stay? Stay for the weekend
Spend a little time just you and I
Just you and I
Spend a little time

I already know the way itâs gonna be
And I donât wanna talk if are trying to be friendly
And I miss those days that slipped away somehow
The time goes by so fast before you know it Iâm moving out

And Iâm constantly reminded
Of another place in time
Why can we just bring it back tonight?

Stay, stay for the weekend
Make it so your eyes
Staring to mine
Would you stay? Stay for the weekend
Spend a little time just you and I

Well you never seem to listen
You never seem to care
Everybody warned me
No one else would dare

Never seem to be there
Never seem to to care
Everybody warned me
No one else would dare

Stay, stay for the weekend
Make it so your eyes
Staring to mine
Would you stay? Stay for the weekend
Spend a little time just you and I

Would you stay? Stay for the weekend
Make it so your eyes
Staring to mine
Would you stay? Stay for the weekend
Spend a little time just you and I
âcause I dont want this to end
Whoa oh!
