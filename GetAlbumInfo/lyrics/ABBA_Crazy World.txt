I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
"There is something," you said "that you may not know.
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother Joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay.
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way."

And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realise
It's a crazy world
