Are you looking down on me right now
I feel your presence beam down
Watching you get ill it changed our lives
Your hand went limp and we cried
I didn't realize you had to go
Emotionless overflow
I wish I had the chance to tell you
I'm so sorry...

Do you hear me
Praying to you  <i>[x2]</i>  (where can I find you
I'm thinking of you    darling, darling, darling)

I know that you are in a better place
Somewhere you can escape
I'm looking for a sign from up above
That you still care and have love
I was really young and didn't know
I wish I had the chance to tell you
I'm so sorry

Work harder for nothing
To come up I'm fading
Work harder for nothing at all
To find you you're nowhere
