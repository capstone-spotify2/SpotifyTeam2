I grew up under normal conditions
Mom was the radio, Dad was the television
They both were doing the best that they could
Working 50 hour weeks and knocking on wood
I did my time in the public school system
I got good grades, never got a shred of wisdom
Can't blame my teachers for anything they did
You can't teach one on one with 33 kids

Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way

I found the one, we put some roots down
Got a 2nd mortgage on the outskirts of town
Now we barbecue every 4th of July
Send our prayers and our fireworks up into the sky

Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and loving the American way

These days we're thinking 'bout kids of our own
Gonna turn this house into a home
In no time at all they'll be singing along

Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way
