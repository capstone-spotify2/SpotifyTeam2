Don't move
Don't do anything
What we captured got away,
slipped from us

Don't speak, don't
don't say anything, 
they've been recording all we say 
for years now.

You won't see them right away
but you'll hear them singing.
Hold me closely now but don't, 
don't say anything.
They've come to take me away
and won't leave until I'm gone

Don't feel
Don't love anything
Love attracts all those who taint, the cherished.

Don't try to
to change anything
Nothing pure can every stay 

They'll say
relax, you'll be fine.

All we love goes away

They'll take 
all you let them find..
it was mine.
