<i>[Spoken:]</i>
Don't make no difference to you
Well, it's all right with me

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking 'bout Georgia too

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing
I'm gonna find it out
Without the slightest doubt

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking of Georgia too

Just 'cause I talk the way I do
Don't mean that it ain't true
'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too

Here me see it again now

'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about...
That's right!

In the meantime

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing

I'll play my guitar
Feels so good!
Just a country boy, yeah

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
(You better believe)
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too

Meanwhile, meanwhile
I'll play my guitar here

South's gonna do it again
