(Get set, ready, go!)

Let's put the week behind us
Set a Saturday night
It's time to get it rockin'
In the colorful light
It's everybody's right
To have a good time

I get my boys together
And get ready to roll
We never slow it down
When we're having a ball
It's a midnight call
Come let's take control

(get set, ready, go!)
(Here we go!)

Woooh!
Ohohohohoh
Come and bounce with me
Come and bounce with me
(aha, aha)
Ohohohohoh
Come and bounce with me (bounce with me)
Come and bounce with me (bounce with me)

We girls need no permission
For a jam on the block (that's right)
This party's in decision
For pendora's box
Come let's regulate
Take it to the top
Oh

And now the club is pumpin' and we're all getting down
I hear my ladies holler
Let's take over this town!
Are you ready now
For another round

Woooh!
Ohohohohoh
Come and bounce with me
Come and bounce with me
(Come and bounce, bounce)
Ohohohohoh
(Come and bounce with me)
Come and bounce with me
Come and bounce with me

Oh yeah... that's the spot
Can you feel it?
Uh

I don't need no bad relation
Or speaking in tongues
All that turns me on, the DJ playing my song
I can't hold it back
I've been waiting too long

(get set, ready, go!)

Woooh!
Ohohohohoh (oh oh... oh oh here we go)
Come and bounce with me (oh oh... oh oh)
Come and bounce with me
Ohohohohoh (oh oh... oh oh here we go)
Come and bounce with me (oh oh... oh oh)
Come and bounce with me
Here we go!
Woooh!
Ohohohohoh (oh oh... oh oh here we go)
Come and bounce with me (just come and bounce, yeah)
Come and bounce with me (come and bounce, bounce)
Ohohohohoh (come and bounce with me)
Come and bounce with me (oh oh... oh oh)
Come and bounce with me
Wooh!
Wooh!
