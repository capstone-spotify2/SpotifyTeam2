Sarah runs to feel the burning in her lungs,
to clear her head
Do you know what Sarah meant
when she said, 
you be my guest
to keep the pace
to save your face
youâll never make the place,
but do you even run the race?

I canât be what you need
I am stuck in a dream
I am stuck in a dream
Donât you know
sheâs been here all along 
in a dream?
She belongs in a dream

Every day
Iâll make promises that plague Sarahâs heart
so I can watch her fall apart
'Cause I know when I break her down
weâll spit on all the happy plans
that live around this sunny town
she loves me like a dog
and when we mess around
Iâll let her know the truth 
I canât rely on hope with fate
and every time I wake
I second guess the game I play
that I make a mistake
