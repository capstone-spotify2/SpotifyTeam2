Got darker parts of my mind, yeah
Got darker days on this grind, yeah
Never pay no mind to what a hater say
Criticize myself more than anybody anyway

Livin' dreams but these
Nightmares keeping me awake
Demons whisper in the dark
Telling me it's a mistake
To have faith in my own grind
But I got power over my own mind

I feel like Doctor Strange, yeah
If we talking demons, know the language

Yeah I feel like Doctor Strange, yeah
Teach you how to persevere
Through the pain yeah

They ask me how I stay so positive
I know where my demons live
Visit but don't let 'em in

Said I visit but don't let 'em in
Yeah I visit but don't let 'em in

Wasn't always so easy
Still hungry like "feed me"

Remember how they would treat me
Now they can't even see me
I ain't trippin' I still got a lot to do
Might be stuntin' if you put me in the mood
Show a different face
Still remember you
I'm in a different place
So what you tryna prove

I did it, I do it showin' you
So check up on me
Like I'm some Nike shoes
Doc Strange the way I kill the demons
That negativity that y'all believe in
Can't believe it

I could help you
Learn to breathe free
Kill the hatred comin' out your teeth
But first you gotta believe me
Jealousy is toxic

Demonic as it gets
Greed is just as poisonous

Y'all see what it infects
Takes over the mind

Leavin' souls behind
Leavin' hearts along the way
The eyes for eyes left blind

I know it better than most
Ain't something I boast
But I turn my demons to ghosts

I found the beauty in thorns
That cover the woes
Cause they're there
To make sure it grows

I found the beauty in rain
The darkest the clouds
The growth to that rose it allows
These days I'm less about when
And more about how

I know, I know
Said I know, I know

I know, I know
Said I know, I know

I know how to fight the demons
How to get 'em all retreating

How to get you back to dreamin'
Cause I know how to fight the demons

It's all up in your head
Stand up for what you rep

Don't need no ones approval
For what you go and get

Leavin' dreams but these
Nightmares keepin' you awake
Demons whisper in the dark
Telling you it's a mistake
To have faith in your own grind
But you got power over your own mind

I feel like Doctor Strange, yeah
If we talking demons, know the language

Yeah I feel like Doctor Strange, yeah
Teach you how to persevere
Through the pain yeah

They ask me how I stay so positive
I know where my demons live
Visit but don't let 'em in

Said I visit but don't let 'em in
Yeah I visit but don't let 'em in
