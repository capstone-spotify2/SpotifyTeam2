<i>[Verse:]</i>
You know, this planet has been in trouble
For a thousand years we've all been blind
There's no trime to waste, give up the struggle
We must embrace our host, give it up for

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Space... invader
He comes from distant galaxies
Space... invader
He stands before you to set you free

<i>[Verse:]</i>
No rhyme or reason, no peace of mind
The earth's survival will coincide
The danger is near, of his arrival
We must accept out fate, give it up for

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Space... invader
Now gaze upon the space invader

He comes to save us from light-years away
Our space invader knows we've lost our way
Destined for greatness our race will survive
Behind his majesty we'll be united
And know the meaning of life

The time is now, no need to worry
Just put your trust in him, give it up for

Space... invader
He comes from distant galaxies
Space... invader
He stands before you to set you free

Space... invader
Now gaze upon the space invader
Space... invader
Remember, there's no one greater
Space... invader
Space... invader
Space... invader
Space... invader
Space... invader
Space... invader
