Scattered thoughts and scattering masses
The war has just begun
the bully pulpit never had so much fun

Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on

All I see are daisies for miles and miles
Lighting universes
The rappers in their limousines just want to be loved

Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get served
Like a wrecking ball on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on

Take me back to days of summer
And give me all the simple things
I bet you got that tattooed on your lonely heart

Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on
