Though I left you there sleeping
No I dare not say a word
Silently weeping
Knowing what I heard
What can I say
I was never good with words
My tongue always got it wrong
Hoping that you knew all along
I love you, I love you <i>[x2]</i>

Hell I've done all I can
How else can I get this through
I know you're someone else's
And I'm sure he needs you
When I'm laying in my bed
I can say what's on my mind
Let my actions be my words
I'm sure that you heard
I love you, I love you <i>[x2]</i>

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
