I never thought dreams could happen,
Until one came true for me.
Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
My life has been one sweet melody.
Yeah! Yeah!
I never thought I could welcome....
Two other hearts as I do.

Oh...Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
Well it's been a real hip thing I'm telling you.
Oh, saying that I want Judy.
Talking about beauty,
She's got it.
I know she's got it.
Her sweet little ways,
Mean so much to me.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

I'm making mine Judy.
To love her! Got her! Got her! Yeah! Yeah!
Gonna keep her right here with me.
Yeah! Oh yeah!
Now I find it hard to believe, that I'm happy.
All my pains and heartaches are all gone.
So glad I can tell the world:
Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
Well my life has been one sweet song.
I won't be worried long.
If you think I'm gonna leave her,
Man, you're wrong.

It's only Judy.
I'm telling you you're wrong.
I love Judy.
I'm crazy about that Judy.
Judy, Judy, Judy!
