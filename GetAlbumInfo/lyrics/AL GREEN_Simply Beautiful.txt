If I gave you my love,
I tell you what I'd do
I'd expect a whole lot of love out of you

You've got to be good to me
I'm gonna be good to you
There's a whole lotta things
You and I could do

What about the way you love me?
And the way you squeeze me?
Simply beautiful
Yeah, beautiful

When you get right down it

(Baby.. baby...)

When you needed me
I was right there beside you, girl

(Baby.. baby...)

(Oh, girl)

Sometime, when you're feeling low
All you got to do is call me
Simply beautiful

(Yeah, baby... yeah)

(Oh baby)

There's so many good things
I could say about you, girl
I could say that I really, really...
