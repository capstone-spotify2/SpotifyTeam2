You should have known better than to insult me
That won't happen again...
Sleep, I'll pretend that you died
And as you rest may your youth be stripped away from you
Sleep my precious, the darling Rosamond
May nightmares lay with you... revenge is mine!

There must be something everyone has missed
The end is drawing near, it's everything I feared
I'm starting to wonder will this haunt me?
In spite of doubt, I have to break the spell

A lovely day to be tortured by dreams of you

Now as she wakes,
I'll finally look in her eyes...
My brilliant prize, please know
You'll never again be alone
For I'm with you

Her sweet lips, oh so fair, to awake is now everything I crave
Time's catching up with me
I've come this far, there's no turning back
My sword is drawn, the only choice I have is to fight
Nothing can stop me now but myself

I will break the spell
Save me! Help me! Someone!
Anyone, please, can you hear me?
My eyes!
Will I ever see light of day again? Never...

Now as she wakes,
I'll finally look in her eyes
My brilliant prize, please know
You'll never again be alone
For I'm with you

You'll never get away!
You'll never get away!
You'll wish you both had died!
He will not break the spell!

A lovely day to be... (My princess...)
...tortured by dreams of you (...into the thorns I shall dive)

Now as she wakes
I'll finally look in her eyes...
My brilliant prize, please know
You'll never again be alone
For I'm with you

My sweet princess finally awake!
