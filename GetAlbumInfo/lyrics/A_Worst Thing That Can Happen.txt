Standing with a headache 
I try to fight but i cant deny the pain 
Reservations what i got from the bottom to the top 
On the bottle 5 times a day 
Standing with the top line 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm shaking, and i feel so alive 

Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 

When there's nothing on, 
You find yourself caught in the spotlight 
You try to fight but you cant delight the phase 
On your knees is what you're not 
Keeping what you got 
Don't try to hide your face 
Caught in a flashlight 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm breaking, and i feel so alive 

Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 

When there's nothing right 
When there's nothing right 

Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you
