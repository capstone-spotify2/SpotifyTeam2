I know a place at the edge of the land
Where the grass runs out and turns into sand
I know a place where a man can't stand
Cos a man can't walk in the sea
I know a place where a man can't go
Where a man would drown and sink below
But if you have a ship then you should know
That you can come with me
Come with me on a quest!
I'm on a quest, a quest for ships
Sailing's how I get my kicks
I'm on a quest, a quest for boats
I'm mad for anything that floats
I'm on a quest, to find a craft
A barge or bark or dinghy or raft
I'm on a quest, a quest for ships
And now I need my fix
I know a place where we can sail
A place I heard of once in a tale
No gems, no gold, no holy grail
A place at the end of the sea
But there's one problem I can see
I have no ship that could take me
But if you have one, or two, or three
Then you can come with me
Come with me on a quest!
I'm on a quest, a quest for ships
Sailing's how I get my kicks
I'm on a quest, a quest for boats
I'm mad for anything that floats
I'm on a quest, to find a craft
A barge or bark or dinghy or raft
I'm on a quest, a quest for ships
Won't return 'til I've had my fix
