C'mon Santa
Won't you bring me a man

It's gettin' late
So send him here
I don't think I can make
It through another year
Come on Santa come through
Oh a usual place
A strong embrace
A pillow and a blanket
By the fireplace
Dim the lights down low

Oh bring me a man
I need a man
Please Santa 
Bring me a man
I need a man keeping me warm

The fire's out
The chimney's clean
The fishnet stockings are hanging
It don't mean a thing
Place him under my tree
And let it snow
This Christmas
And let it snow
This Christmas

Oh bring me a man
I need a man
Please Santa
Bring me a man
I need a man keeping me warm

I've been a good girl all year long
I done my best right or wrong
Come on Santa won't you please
Look at me I'm on my knees
Oh bring me a man

Come on, come on, come on
C'mon, Santa Claus
Come on, come on, come on
C'mon, reindeers
Come on, come on, come on
C'mon, flying thru the sky delivering presents to all the good boys and girls around the world in one night okuurrrr
Now Let it snow...
Let it snow...
Let it snow...
Let it snow... 

Bring me a man
I need a man
She did that
Dear Santa
Bring me a man
I need a man
Keeping me warm (C'mon small town)
Bring me a man
I need a man
Oh Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa
Bring me a man
I need a man
Keeping me warm
Bring me a Man
(Imma suck all these Santa's)
