This is the story of a country girl
Back in town from her country house
She came to me with her muddy boots
She destroyed all my carpet
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
You never wear cosmetic
You don't like arithmetic
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
Tasting,touching,swallowing me
Drinking me like bloody mary
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
You don't wear cosmetic
You don't like arithmetic
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
Tasting,touching,swallowing me
Drinking me like bloody mary
Wonder milky bitch
Wonder milky bitch
Wonder milky bitch
Wonder milky bitch
