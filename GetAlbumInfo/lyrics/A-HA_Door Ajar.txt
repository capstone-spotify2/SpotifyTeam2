Door Ajar
Door Ajar
Door Ajar

I hit my head on the pillow, hard
I heard a noise from the boulevard
And it made me go down
I left the door to my room ajar
Felt the rumble of the street-car
And it spiralled me down

If you could see me
Swallowed by darkness
What would it matter
Would it awaken
Feelings forsaken
Faded and scattered
Would you come running
If you could hear me
Some way or another
Thatâs what Iâm thinking
Watching the stars reflect in the gutter
Door Ajar
Door Ajar

I hit my heard on the pillow, hard
I took the words that you said to heart
And it made me feel down
When I awoke it was dark outside
Just a flicker from a traffic light
And it signalled me down

If you could see me
Swallowed in darkness
What would it matter
Would it awaken
Feelings forsaken
Faded and scattered
Would you come running
If you could hear me
Some way or another
Thatâs what Iâm thinking
Watching the stars reflect in the gutter
Door Ajar
Door Ajar
Door Ajar
Door Ajar
Door Ajar
