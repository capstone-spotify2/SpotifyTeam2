Yeah, yeah
(Uh-uh)
It's me, it's me
(Uh-uh)
I was hatched in '83
Fuckin' standing like the Notre Dame logo right now
Just leave this shit, man

If I choose the right horse, I'm a buy a white Porsche
Never take the night off, saying that my mind's off
Ever since I came out I been handing pain out
Fold a wire-hanger through your nose
Take your brain out, hey now
On the stage I'm like great balls of fire
One more year I'll be on 'Late George', retired
Big steak like a cheap tire
Season up some biceps and throw 'em in deep fryer

I been hot since I was this big, yeah
I been hot since I was this big, stupid

I'm sick like feeding squirrels the summer in a bubble jacket
If this was '96 I def had The Tunnel packed in
Big beard like I'm lumberjackin'
Mash the petal of the 850
Sound like the thunder cracking
I'm in a club with a condom on
All Under Armour on

And when I die, make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die, make sure you spread my blood on a BMW

<i>[Action Bronson:]</i>
Microphone attached to my hand so I can dance my little heart out
Don't make me bring the white guitar out
Like the one in Wayne's World
That was shining in the window
Since 13 I been a nympho
Fuck That's Delicious on box set
Me and my mans smoking on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Achmed's 'zookas on shoulders
Hundreds pounds of C4 in a stroller
Z4s roll up, shit's cold, I think I need a ricola
I just dropped a million kroner I'm a stoner
You lack culture, I'm a psychedelic image of a black vulture Trapped inside a past soldier

I just blew my motherfuckin' high, man. Holy shit
I been hot since I was this big, motherfucker

<i>[Big Body Bes:]</i>
And when I die, make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die, make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
Albanian style, I wanna die by machine gun
