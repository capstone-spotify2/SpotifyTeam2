These days, the back of my mind

Lately Iâve been thinking
About the thing that you di back then
âBout all them girls, now you mess with them
Know I forgave you but I canât forget

It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind

Whenever I look up in the sky Iâm like
Count the stars
It amounts to all the teardrops from my eyes
Oh yes it does

And it hurts 
Cause I love you
And this shit just wonât go away
Itâs in my head

It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind

I tried to forget it
I tried
But it just wonât leave me alone
I wanna move on
But it just stays, stays in the back of my mind
Oh it stays, stays in the back of my mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
