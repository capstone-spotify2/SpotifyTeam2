Oh, come on in!

The temptation on two legs
Like a wedding ring wrapped around her finger I'm in the wrong bed
I feel myself slippin' into hell's door
Like a hurricane she's blowing my brain, I'm coming back for more

'Cause I know it's so wrong, but it feels so right
I gotta take another bite

I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
I'm going to hell, going to hell for this, oh yeah!

The satisfaction under my thumb
Yeah, I'm tying the knot, thicken the plot
'Cause I'm in it for the fun

'Cause I know it's so wrong, but it feels so right
I gotta take another bite

I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
I'm going to hell, going to hell for this, oh, get out of my way!

He's got a gun
There's nowhere to run
Grab the kitchen knife
And I fight for my life

Yeah

'Cause I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
I'm going to hell, going to hell for this
