Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful , we had it all
No use looking to the past
We both knew it wouldn't last

But it was fun we had a blast
So beautiful, as I recall
Where did it go yeah...

Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing, now?

Breaking rules we always would
Doing things we never should
We were so bad but it felt so good
Do you remember I think you remember
I wonder where you are tonight
But I know that you'll be alright
'Cos I see our star is shining bright
It's so beautiful, it will never fall
Where did you go

Come on now, sing it loud

Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your guy'd get mad
But they don't have to know, yeah
Do you remember singing, now?
