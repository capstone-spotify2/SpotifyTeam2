Some girls like the boys who are bad
Some girls just don't know what they have
Who, who are you?

Some girls always follow the cash
Some girls can't let go of the past
Who, who are you?
Who, who are you?
Won't you tell me now?
Won't you tell me now?

Tell me what you love
Is it sunlight?
Tell me what you feel
Is it alright?
Sitting on the bed in the back of the room
We can get along if you want us to
Tell me what you want
Now in this life
Tell me what you say
Yeah, when the mood is right
Sitting on the bed in the back of the room
When can hit it off if you want us to

(Oooh, oooh)
I'll undercover you

Some girls like the boys who are fast
Some girls like making it last
Who, who are you?

Some girls got so much to prove
But those girls got nothing on you
Who, who are you?
Who, who are you?
Won't you tell me now?
Won't you tell me now?

Tell me what you love
Is it sunlight?
Tell me what you feel
Is it alright?
Sitting on the bed in the back of the room
We can get along if you want us to
Tell me what you want
Now in this life
Tell me what you say
Yeah, when the mood is right
Sitting on the bed in the back of the room
When can hit it off if you want us to

(Oooh, oooh)
I'll undercover you
(Oooh, oooh)
I'll undercover you
(Oooh, oooh)
I'll undercover you
