Here in the world of words unspoken weâve broken down
Letâs take that defective heart apart
Out of the light - a final showing
Weâre closing down and to get that faulty heart to start

Follow me down the road.
Iâm promising I will be a good boy.

I canât let you see, I canât let you see
I canât let you see me sleeping.
I canât let you see, I may have to leave.
I canât let you see me sleeping.

Here in the world of words unspoken weâve broken down
And to get that faulty heart to start
Enter this house of empty movements
Weâre losing every faint sense of who we were. We are.

Follow me to this room.
Promise me you will keep your eyes closed.

I canât let you see, I canât let you see
I canât let you see me sleeping.
I canât let you see, I may have to leave.
I canât let you see me sleeping.

I canât let you see me
I canât let you see me
I canât let you see me sleep.
With my mouth agape.
Donât watch me too closely.

I canât let you see, I canât let you see
I canât let you see me sleeping.
I canât let you see old blood on my teeth.
I canât let you see me sleeping.

I canât let you see me sleeping.
I canât let you see me sleeping.
