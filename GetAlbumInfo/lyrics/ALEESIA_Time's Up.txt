Could we be alone for one last night
I know we really shouldn't but
I know that we're both craving one last fight
So break my heart one final time

Time's almost up
And so is us
So give me all you got tonight

This ugly love
It's like a drug
So wrong, we couldn't make it right

Til time is up
Take me for granted, yeah
Til time is up
Just give me your hand and

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up

Even though I know your taste is my poison
I'm hungry for one last bite
So hold me til it hurts and just stay babe
Wanna remember how it feels like

You scream, I cry
You laugh, I lie
It's time I hope I survive

This ugly love
Is like a drug
So wrong, we couldn't make it right

Til time is up
Take me for granted, yeah
Til time is up
Just give me your hand and

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up

Til we can't see
Til we can't speak
Til we can't breathe
Til time is up

Til we can't see
Til we can't speak
Til we can't breathe
Til time is up

Always ugly
Always so mean
All that we know
Can't let it go

Beautiful disaster now
That time is ticking faster
And it's more than complicated
Knowing that this love is fading, oh

Til time is up
Take me for granted, yeah
Til time is up
Just give me your hand and

(Til we can't see)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Til we can't speak)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Til we can't breathe)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up

(Til we can't see)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Til we can't speak)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Til we can't breathe)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Til time is up
