It's time for some real world politics, 
economics, history, math and English. 
Born and raised and bred walking a thin line,
between lost and succeeding and don't ever care about.
The rules aren't changing it if you really tell it like it is
Threats always been there, terror always happens.

For all the fights, for all the songs, all we said. 
All we have is these pictures of us. 
If it doesn't matter now then it never really did, 
And without this we might as well be dead.

They're all black and white people, 
and that doesn't have anything to do with us. 
After all these years it's still an arms race, 
after all these years they still don't fucking get it. 
Lives and cultures matter more than capitalist interest. 
It's the FBI; it's the CIA; it's the ATF, the IMF, NBC, CBS. Fuck you.

For all the fights, for all the songs, all we said. 
All we have is these pictures of us. 
If it doesn't matter now then it never really did, 
And without this we might as well be dead. 

When you are so hungry that you'd believe anything. 
Well they're selling you the politics of starving. 
And what the fuck does that really mean to us?
