Black leather - steel engines
All the people call us street fighting man
Rude manners - hard woman
That's the reason why we join the gang

No friendship - damned cops
We just stay the way we are
Drugs and whisky - downtown heroes
We control the city roads

Free wheeling on the highway
A hundred engines are racing around
Like thunder and lightning
Can't you hear the roaring sound

Making rules - giving orders
You're thinking that you are the stars
But we hate you damned faces
You're little houses and bloody cars

Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are
Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are

Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are
Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are

Black leather - steel engines
All the people call us street fighting man
Rude manners - hard woman
That's the reason why we join the gang

No friendship - damned cops
We just stay the way we are
Drugs and whisky - downtown heroes
We control the city roads

Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are
Hate you - hate you - leave us alone, man
Keep your stuff - and stay where you are
