Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

Sing, yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so

Jesus loves me, He who died
Heaven's gates to open wide
He will wash away my sins
And let his little child come in
Keep on singin' y'all

Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so

Listen children, Jesus loves me
He will stay close beside me all the way
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high
Keep on singin' y'all

Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
Keep on singin' y'all

Yes, Jesus loves me
I know He loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
