For a time he lived in Tennessee
A brilliant hillbilly
A cool zombie
The People there were real friendly
Flat top cats and dungarees
A cool zombie
The town of Dayton suited me
54 Pickup, eggs over easy
Zombie

Took him a trip to London town
Goldfish eyes and a permanent frown
A cool zombie
We haven't seen ya in a while
Would give you anything but a smile
A cool zombie
The pink's shilling
And the body was willing
But not playing with a full deck

The dead man eyes a giveaway
His baby blues a thousand miles away
A cool zombie

(Come closer)
Dead man with a famous head
(Come closer)
Earning him a crust of bread
(Come closer)
I'll sign my book of the dead
(Come closer)
I might even sign your leg
(Come closer)
Here's my best side baby
(Come closer)
Ten words in my vocabulary

I bought an A-framed house to suit me
On top of the Vale in Tennessee
The place that made world history
The Monkey Trial of 23
Cool zombie

The kind of place a lost soul could hide
Hadn't changed since Bonnie and Clyde
This goes out to Ronnie B
The sailor man on his Harley
Showed me how good life could be
A real-life tour of God's country
The good folk there were good to me
They never ever twigged
I was a cool zombie

Yeah!
