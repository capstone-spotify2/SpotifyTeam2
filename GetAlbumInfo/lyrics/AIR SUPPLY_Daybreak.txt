Daybreak, I Can't Hide The Truth
It Seems I'm Not So Strong
And Suddenly, There's No More To Loose
So Where Did I Go Wrong
I Should Have Known Before
Her Love For Me Was Gone

Now I'm Waiting For The Light
To Fill This Empty Room
I Need You Now To Break Thru The Night
Whose Shadows Come Too Soon

I Waited Far Too Long And Now
I Feel I Can't Go On

Daybreak, Oh Daybreak
I Let Her Walk Away
I Should Have Said, Don't Go
I Know I Should Have Found Another Way
Now I Don't Know What To Do
So Daybreak, Please Break Through

Daybreak, I Feel So Alone
Why Won't You Come To Stay

I Waited Far Too Long and Now
I Feel I Can't Go On

Daybreak, Oh Daybreak
I Let Her Walk Away
I Should Have Said, Don't Go
I Know I Should Have Found Another Way
Now I Don't Know What To Do
So Daybreak, Please Break Thru
