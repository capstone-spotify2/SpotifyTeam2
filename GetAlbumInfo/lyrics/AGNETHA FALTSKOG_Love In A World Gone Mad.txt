Both sides of your windows
Something crazy's going on,
Troubles in and outside
It's hard to tell where you belong.

Time and time again
Out searching for that silver lining, friend
You keep holding on, you keep holding on.

Love in a world gone mad,
The best thing we'll ever have
Love in a world gone mad,
And it's so precious that I promise
Anytime you want to spread your wings and fly
Just say the word,
If what we found is love
When you fly back I won't be hurt.

Time and time again,
The fire's gonna die and then burn bright
If we keep holding on, yeah, holding on.

Love in a world gone mad,
The best thing we'll ever have
Love in a world gone mad,
And it's so precious what's between us two is...
Love in a world gone mad,
The best thing we'll ever have
Love in a world gone mad,
And it's so precious what's between us two is...love.

Time and time again,
You're gonna be my silver lining, friend
If you keep holding on, holding on.

Love in a world gone mad,
The best thing we'll ever have
Love in a world gone mad,
And it's so precious what's between us two....

Love in a world gone mad,
The best thing we'll ever have
Love in a world gone mad,
And it's so precious what's between us two....
