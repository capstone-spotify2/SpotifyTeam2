There's no greater crime than wastin' your life on a boat goin' nowhere
When you came along you made it safe for love to survive
I trusted and dreamed and you came like I knew you would
I've been 'round before but this feels so good

I could not walk by . I knew that I'd found
What's at the end of the rainbow
There's no place on earth I'd rather be than stayin' right here with you
It's not about luck . I don't need to knock on wood no, no
Been 'round before but this feels so good

Night after night it's so hard to believe
That I wake up each day next to you
Time after time in the cold mornin' light, it's good to know
It's good to know that it's true

There's no greater sin than missin' your chance
When it's starin' right at'ya
That look in your eye says everything and tells me I'm home
For once in my life I don't feel misunderstood
Well I've been 'round before but this time it feels so sure

Been 'round before but this feels so good
Been 'round before but this feels so good
