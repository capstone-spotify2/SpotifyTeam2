<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Whoa, these hoes selling pussy, I be selling dreams
These hoes want my loving, I want what's in between
These hoes chasing ballers, I been chasing green
That ho think I love her, shit ain't what it seems, whoa
She thinking she's special, bitch you just joined the team
I fucked once at the Hilton, and you so much a fiend
This chick must be crazy, cause she go acting lazy
My mind on making millions, she's talking about having a baby
See I'm just trying to kick it, and she just wants to lay up
She's thinking romantic, I'm thinking bout Kayla
I think I should call her, please come over naked
Dick might make you famous, I should make her pay me, whoa

<i>[Hook:]</i>
I should make her pay me
I should make her pay me
This dick will make you famous, I should make her pay me
This dick will make you famous, I should make her pay me
I should make her pay me
I should make her pay me
You're fucking with a star, this dick will make you famous
She's blowing up my phone, bitch I should make you pay me

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
OK, I beat the pussy, leave it gooshy, after that she's straight to sleep
Say she came a couple times, this bitch should be paying me
On the counter, on the floor, hit that in my Louie sneaks
Dripping wet, soaking wet, she says she wants more of me
Power of the pussy, that ho says she's got me, I'm already tooken
Married to the money, that hoes there to push it
Called me said she's cooking, she just wants my goodies, whoa
And you wonder why they be falling, they can't stop from calling
Dick might make you famous, pay me my deposit
See I'm no normal nigga, bitch I'm worth a couple million
I dig this deep off in you, you switch up your religion, know what
