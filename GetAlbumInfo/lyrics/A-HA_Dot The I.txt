Dot the I
Stretch your lips and smile
Let the world run by

Be the fool
Tomorrow morning's here
And I'm all nonsense, dear

I see, I know, I hear you say
Come near, come close to me
Love happened to happen to me

Dot the I
Trust your kite to fly
I could lend you mine

Spot the gag
Tick it, tock it, light a fag
Pass it on to me

I see, I know, I hear you say
Come near, come close to me
Love happened to happen, you see

I see, I know, I hear you say
Come near, come close to me
Love happened to happen to me

I see, I know, I hear you say
Come near, come close to me
Love happened to happen, you see

I see, I know, I hear you say
Come near, come close to me
Love happened to happen to me

Dot the I
Count to three and sigh
I need you to dot the I
