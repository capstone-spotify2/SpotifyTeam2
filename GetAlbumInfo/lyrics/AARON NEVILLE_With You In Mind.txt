With you in mind, things just ain't bad as they seem
With you in mind, I can fill my wildest dreams
With you in mind, I can do anything, I know I can
With you in mind
With you in mind

With you in mind, I went out looking for the best
With you in mind, cause you deserve nothing less
With you in mind, I've done so many things that love can bring
With you in mind
With you in mind

Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day

Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day

Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
The same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day
