As life goes on Iâm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occurred yet
And the things they donât want to take responsibility for

Iâm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
Iâm sorry for the times that I had to go
Iâm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
Iâm sorry for the times I would neglect
Iâm sorry for the times I disrespect

Iâm sorry for the wrong things that Iâve done
Iâm sorry Iâm not always there for my sons
Iâm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you canât sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then itâs just a shame on me
Iâll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You can put the blame on me <i>[4x]</i>
Said you can put the blame on me <i>[3x]</i>
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didnât know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kings

He got a second wife and you didnât agree
He got up and left you there all alone
Iâm sorry that you had to do it on your own
Iâm sorry that I went and added to your grief
Iâm sorry that your son was once a thief
Iâm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I wouldâve listened and not be so bad
Iâm sorry that your life turned out this way
Iâm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Iâm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
Iâm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
Iâm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
Iâm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say
Why doesnât anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
Iâm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans Iâll take that blame

Even though the blameâs on you <i>[3x]</i>
Iâll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me <i>[2x]</i>
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me <i>[2x]</i>
