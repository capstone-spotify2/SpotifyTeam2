You are like a disease <i>[X3]</i>

It's safe to say I'm afraid of what I wanna do, for you
I'm insane full of shame for what I would have done, it's true
Forget you face had to say is what I wanna do, to you
Sick and tired all the time it's all because of you, it's true

It's tearing me up I'm letting you go, you were like a disease
It's something so rough, cause you're killing me
I knew all along the only cure I see is letting you go now just go away

So take away all the pain for just a little taste, of you
You had it all had to fall now it's time to make a move, you lose
And just so you know I'm taking the things that you told me, I'll never be lonely
I'll take it out and throw it away

It's tearing me up I'm letting you go, you were like a disease
It's something so rough, cause you're killing me
I knew all along the only cure I see is letting you go now just go away

You're like a disease

I'm letting you go (you were like a disease)
It's something so rough (cause you're killing me)
I knew all along (the only cure I see)
I'm letting you go so just wait for the ride (you were like a disease)
It's something so rough (you were like a disease)
I knew all along (the only cure I see)
is letting you go now just go away, away

It's tearing me up <i>[X2]</i>

You were like a disease
