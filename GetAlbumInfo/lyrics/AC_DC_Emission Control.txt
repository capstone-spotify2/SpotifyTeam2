Hey ya

Here's my mission
To seek you out
You're up for grabs, honey
Breathe in, don't make a sound

Get up
Get high off the ground
Give it up
Not fooling around
Breaking it up
You can't be here and be shy
Raising it up
Six guns to the sky

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Come in emission control
Emission control
Come in emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul, yeah

Turn on emission
The engine comes alive
She takes to pairing mama
Like a lion ready to strike
Ready to strike
Hey ya

Hold it up
Take full flight and fly
Hold it up
You got to raise it on high
Reaching it up
You can't be here and be shy
Reaching it up
Six guns to the sky
Giving it up
Giving it up

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Giving it up
Giving it up
Raising it up
<i>[x2]</i>
