Thirsty Thirsty Thursday

Iâm up and I raise my cup
Singing âeverything is goldâ
Crew neck and a white, blank check
Iâll be moving on my own
(Yodel-lay-eehoo)
Well Iâm done sippinâ on that love
Itâs another bumpy road
But Iâm up and I raise my cup
And I wanna take her home
(Yodel-lay-eehoo)

I run my mouth
Donât got a lot to say
Girl on fire
Could burn my heart away
We are young
But we can make it rain

Itâs Thirsty Thirsty Thursday

Iâm up and I raise my cup
See you bouncinâ on the floor
Perfume in a hotel room
We go bouncinâ back for more
(Yodel-lay-eehoo)
Well Iâm loe sippinâ on that fun
Itâs a feeling we adore
But Iâm up and I raise my cup
And I wanna take her home
(Yodel-lay-eehoo)

I run my mouth
Donât got a lot to say
Girl on fire
Could burn my heart away
We are young
But we can make it rain

Oooh

Weâre so thirsty 
Got no one except me
Weâre so gutsy
When no ones watching
