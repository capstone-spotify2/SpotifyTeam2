Well I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started our fight
I must've drank away my blues
'Cause I don't remember losin' you
Well I must've done the town up right
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night

Well I woke up this mornin'
Underneath my bed
And someone's in the kitchen sink
With cowboy boots on and nothin' else at all
Except my hat turned backway on her head

Well I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started out fight
Well I must've drank away my blues
'Cause I don't remember losing you
Well I must've done the town up right
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night

Well my picture's on the table
Somebody tore it right in two
Well who'd do such a crazy thing
Someone took your suitcase and your little car
And I hate it 'cause the tires are new

Yeah, I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started out fight
I must've drank away my blues
'Cause I don't remember losing you
Well I must've done the town up right
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night

Well I must've done the town up right
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowing
But all the signs are showing
I must've had a ball last night
Well, there ain't way knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night
