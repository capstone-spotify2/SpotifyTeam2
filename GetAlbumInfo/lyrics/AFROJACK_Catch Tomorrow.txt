He lost it all, he's homeless now
Walking on Sunset Boulevard alone
No place to go

That's when I asked him, "What you're smiling for?"
He said, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

And every night she walks the streets
With a little red dress looking for some love
She's out of luck

But if you'll ask her, "What you're smiling for?"
She'd say, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
He said, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

On great Aunt Osh she realized
Everything she lovedâeven goldâexpires.
All she got is a soul

But if I asked her, "What you're smiling for?"
She'd say, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

Saw a boy and a little girl walking hand in hand
No future at all
Out in the cold

Don't have to ask them, "What you're crying for?"
I know they're on this road tryna catch tomorrow!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow
