Bang bang
Bang bang

She's got a heart like a gun
It's hitting on quite a figurine
Staring straight at the sun she says
Boy I'd like to pull your trigger
She's every young boy's dream
So who's there to question
When she said "come with me"
Well so I did her her suggestion
We went round and round baby all night long
When it was going down she said hold on
'scuse me dear before you fill your cup
I got just one thing to say
Stick em' up

Bang bang
(bang bang)
All night long
She held me up she struck me down and kept it coming on she said
Bang bang
Do it again
Tell my mom I'll pay the rent so I don't want this night to end

(Know what I'm saying?)
The night was going fast
The morning cable I don't want it
We tried to make it last
But now we really must be going
I had a one lost shot to make my 9 to 5
Made a run for the door I was bad and I
She was lying under cover, cool and hard as steel
But she blew me a kiss and then she made me a seal it went

Bang bang
(bang bang)
All night long
She held me up she struck me down and kept it coming on she said
Bang bang
Do it again
Tell my mom I'll pay the rent so I don't want this night to end

Ohhhh!
She can't get enough
Ohhhh!
So get ready
It's time to look for love
Down the barrel of a gun

Stick em' up
Baby
Bang Bang

She went bang bang
(bang bang)
All night long
She held me up she struck me down and kept it coming on she said
Bang bang. do it again
Tell my mom I'll pay the rent so I don't want this night to end

Bang bang
(bang bang)
All night long
She held me up she struck me down and kept it coming on she said
Bang bang. do it again
Tell my mom I'll pay the rent so I don't want this night to end

Bang bang
(bang bang)
Bang bang...
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
All night long
(bang bang)
Baby all night long
(bang bang)
