And money on their mind
Money money on their mind
And my presidents is going in the air when she whines on my
Body mile she's from the south she's dancing on my room
After that I give her more and she dances on pole
Up and down just like her go
Give her a moment and then she'll go
On the floor, on the floor,
Take it down, take it down, down low

For all the stupids on my hitlist
Watch how many rags I blow
They say this look is best for my...
I know, I know, I know
And I've got 'em all taking off their clothes
And I've got 'em all working on that pose
I'm the bomb like napalm, Akon what you're waiting on, LEHGGOO
