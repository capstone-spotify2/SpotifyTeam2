Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight

Everybody gets down sometime
When I get down I turn to rhyme
I write lyrics like diary 
When the words come out yeah it's good for me 
But every body needs a little help
When you lost for words and you can't help yourself
Just step out to your balcony and

Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking on the same sky starlight

Why (do) you lost your confidence
You're beautiful, it don't make sense to me
It's been a while since I've seen you laugh
Last time you face it for a photograph
And when there's no one to hold ya
And you're all out of hope 
Just remember what I told ya
Just step out to your balcony and

Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining up for you
We'll looking at the same sky starlight

Every night in a way you'll find me
I'm in the sky the moon beside me
Just look around and they're out here 
Waiting waiting for you <i>[2x]</i>

I'm waiting for you <i>[3x]</i>

Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We'll looking out on the same sky starlight

Every night in a way you'll find me
Just look around and they're out here 

Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight
