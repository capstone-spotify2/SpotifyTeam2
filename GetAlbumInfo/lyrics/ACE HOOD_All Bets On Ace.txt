As I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death
I tell 'em I should fear no man so where my enemy at?
I'm movin' dat Phantom wit' cannons
See the curtains is black
I murder you niggas for certain and
I be in and be back
Like an Energizer bunny I keep it goin' in fact
Hop on any track and demolish
Don't you bother wit' that
Cuz that bitch who bother
Me them hollows out the Tahoe
We be poppin' like it's bottles
Chop you up like a sarodo in fact
I get on any shit and rip it peep my energy pack
Just name any nigga dat want wit' me riddle me that
Riddle me this, if I don't rip you consider me wack
I'm on top of the fuckin' game so y'all do better than dat
But I think dey runnin' late dey takin' breaks
Before you think or even blink I be off up in yo' place
Put dat heater to yo' face
And tell you lead me to the safe
Don't cooperate dat caution tape will cover up yo' place
This is All Bets nigga on that muthafuckin' Ace
That is I greedy guy, run up in and take yo' pies
If you niggas wonder why, look it's in my fuckin' eyes
Never wonder what's in mind, give you just a bit of time
I'm starvin' you fuck niggas out of yo' mind
Fuck yo' problems, fuck yo' momma
Fuck yo' baby momma drama, fuck yo' sista
Fuck yo' daughter, when you fuckin' wit' the Devil
We are rebels
Hear the tremble when you walk over them pebbles
Wear them guns like it's a medal bitch
I heavy metal handle grip, word shop like it's a sander
I'm 100 and loaded like a muthafuckin' Rambo
Make you scramble from this ammo
That I put off in this hammer, bitch it's hammer time
You asinine, I'm mastermind
And half the time I'm over time
And after mine there will be none
If there's some they runnin' from me half the time
Yes I am a problem I be wildin'
I be smilin' while I'm askin' for yo' wallet
What you drivin'? Give me diamonds
Ask yo' lady she desire me cuz I'm fly as any pilot
Quitted college just to follow me the sight
See on an island, I am G-U-T-T-A put this bass up in yo' face
Until you feel the b-b-b-b-bass from this K-K-K-K-K
I am runnin' in yo' place it is I
Yes Ace Mister H-Double O-D
Mister get you when you sleep
Mister see me in the street
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin' beast, I never sleep
I just go eat
And if I hear of any beef, and then I want a lil' piece
Just let me get a lil' piece
I walk yo' block and hit yo' street like I'm a muthafuckin' G
A matter fact I am a G, and you a P-U-S-S-Y
All you niggas said I couldn't, and I told you to yo' eyes
And bitch I'm on some murder mind
And bitch I'm on some other grind
You can't compare me to yo' kind
Just listen up and wonder why
Yes I am blind to you niggas rappin' wit' no passion
Can't imagine, ever yappin'
I be rappin', spittin' magic, let you have it
Now let me breath and let me free you some satisfaction
Huhhhhh October 14th, Gutta
Like I told you niggas befo'
See I be in and be back
I'm like an Energizer bunny wit' no energy pack
Fuck lettin' you niggas go breath, you can swallow the track
Or you can swallow all them hollows that insert to the gat
And see I gave, won't fold now I'm back in yo' chest
It's all bets on the next nigga show me yo' best
And next time I come around have that check and da cash
Just tell dem niggas Khaled they should put it all on yo' man
Yeah, put it all on yo' man
October 14th I'm takin' all bets in advance
