You're breakin' my heart, I'm fallin' apart
You make me crazy, crazy
You're breakin' my heart, I don't wanna start
A new day, new day

I'm wreckin' my brain, I'm feelin' insane
You make me crazy, crazy
I'm changin' my ways, I'm leavin' today
But things look hazy, hazy

I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got
Locked up inside
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight
What's on your mind?

Maybe we could make it one more time
Maybe we should try it again
Maybe we could make it one more time
Baby please let me know when

You're breakin' my heart, I'm fallin' apart
You make me crazy, crazy
You're breakin' my heart, I'm spinnin' apart
I'm lookin' this and that way

I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got
Locked up inside
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight
What's on your mind?

What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
Tell me

Maybe we could make it one more time
Maybe we should try it again 
Maybe we could make it one more time
Baby please let me know when

I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got
Locked up inside
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight
What's on your mind?

I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got
