Everybody has to get older
Even Jenny
She's just nineteen, young and naive
She wants to find a way to be endless
Fight the science, and defiance, and be timeless

Silly little girl who tried to live forever, live forever
Gave away her soul to buy a bit of pleasure, the bitter pleasure
Oh wicked little boy who tried to steal her treasure, for the bitter pleasure
Now their cursed forever
Cursed together

And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price

And as she got a little bit older
Look at Jenny
Now she's ninety
She looks nineteen
And all she know to do is surviving
Now she's crying
'Cause she's not dying
That's the price when

Silly little girl who tried to live forever, live forever
Gave away her soul to buy a bit of pleasure, the bitter pleasure
Oh wicked little boy who tried to steal her treasure, for the bitter pleasure
Now their cursed forever
Cursed together

And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price

Silly little girl who tried to live forever, to live forever
Gave away her soul to buy a bit of pleasure, oh the bitter pleasure
Oh wicked little boy who tried to steal her treasure, for the bitter pleasure
Now their cursed forever
Cursed together

And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
