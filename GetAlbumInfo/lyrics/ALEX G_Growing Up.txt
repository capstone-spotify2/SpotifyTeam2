Close enough to touch
But maybe that's too much
Tell me just how far you'd like to be
'Cause boy I've read the signs
But you're right between the lines
Tell me what you want to mean to me

But maybe it's not right
Maybe I'm too uptight
Maybe you're not good for me
And maybe we're stuck here
Maybe it'll take a couple years
But maybe this is us just growing up

Oh...
Oh...

Close enough to love
But for you, it's not enough
To let go of your fears and take me in
Don't you listen to your past
Real love is made to last
Could you try to be sure of something for once in your life

And maybe it's not right
Maybe I'm too uptight
Maybe you're not good for me
And maybe we're stuck here
Maybe it'll take a couple years
But maybe this is us just growing up

But maybe you'll love me, yeah
And maybe you'll love me, yeah
And maybe you'll love me, love
Maybe you'll love me, yeah

But maybe this is right
Maybe I come alive 
Every time you're near me now
Maybe we're meant to be
Maybe you'll fall in love with me
But maybe this is us just growing up
