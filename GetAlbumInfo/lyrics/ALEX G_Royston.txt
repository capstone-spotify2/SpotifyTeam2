Too good
That's how good it was while I had you
Too wrong
That's how wrong it is that you died

And mama's on the ground
But I can't hear a sound
And no time
That's how much I got to prepare

And I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you

Too numb
That's how numb I've been since I saw you
Unfair
That's how fair it is that you're gone

And there are petals on the ground
And everyone's around me
And not much
That's how much I've prayed since you left

But I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you

But I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
