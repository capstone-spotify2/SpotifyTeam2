<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 

Oh no muthafucka, suck up that lip! 
Beause I'm back in this bitch and I'm ready to trip! 
So I hope u never doubted me, cause here I am 
Packed in ya eardrum, like a can of Spam 
And I wouldn't give a damn if u hated me now 
Because my family hears me out and bumps this shit out loud 
You can call us psycho, crazy, insane, with no one to blame 
So we just sit in the rain 
Waitin for the right day to get what we deserve 
Like respect from the cops on the curb at the concert 
Nice titties, my oh my, but when that tear gas fire 
You better close your eyes 
Every time a new adventure, punch a horse in the face 
Smoke a blunt blunt in the forest while you piss in the lake 
Situations fucked up, fun and foul 
But it's a whole new year so try and stop me now 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 

Do you believe in what you do? 
Don't stop, don't let no one hold you 
Back from what you really wanna do 
Besides in this life all you got is you 
Keep your mind clear (Keep your mind clear) 
Don't let go...go...go... So emotional 
Believe me...I know!! 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 

You can't hold me back, because I'm comin' full throttle 
Hand on my hatchet, who wanna see a head bobble? 
I see my streets, like it's a native warfield 
And I'm the only red-skin left, standing with no shield 
So I started to chop cause I can't stop 
Its looking too peaceful up there on the top 
So I'm, doing everything that I must 
Even if I gotta bust on the ones I can't trust 
Ain't nothing hold me back! 
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine! 
(You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me!) 
Ain't nothing hold me back! 
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine! 
(You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me!) 

<i>[Chorus repeats until end]</i>
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now!
