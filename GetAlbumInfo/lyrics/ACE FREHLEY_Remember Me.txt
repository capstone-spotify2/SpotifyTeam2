Well I'm staring down from Venus in the dead of night
My mind is thinking back to when the world was right
Your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line
And people keep on starving and you think that's just fine
<i>[Chorus:]</i>
With my head in the clouds its easy to see
You better live together peacefully
You know the world is still your family
So keep it straight - remember me
It's not too late - remember me
Well I'm floating and spinning and flying
above the Earth's atmosphere
And I've got a few things to say
That you may not wanna hear
Now there's just enough time to repair it
As long as you don't let it get you down
But there's not a whole lot you can do for yourself
when you're buried underground
<i>[Chorus]</i>
There's so much yelling an screaming
and lying and cheating
and robbing and preaching
That we've heard it all
We need some loving and caring
And kissing and hugging
And helping eachother
Or we're gonna fall
And that'll be all
So remember me
<i>[Chorus]</i>
