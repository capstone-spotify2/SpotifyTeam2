That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Raindrop, drop top
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox
Shake on your chick she a thot, thot
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot
We came from nothin' to somethin' brah
I don't trust nobody, no one nah
Call up the gang, and they comin' for ya
Cry me a river...

If we
Tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate
Is warm, long as you around me
Baby, there's no me without you and...

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh I'm falling
So I'm taking my time on my ride like

"Hola, Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", and I said "Bonjour Madame"

Then I say woah
Bounce that thing like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how...

You nee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ded me

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel right

And I'm never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
Like controlla, controlla
Like controlla, controlla

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do, yeah

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford, heeey

Let me treat you better than he can
Girl you deserve a gentleman

She said "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, you don't ever come to me"

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold

Baby, I like your style

Como tÃº te llamas, yo no sÃ©
De donde llegaste, ni preguntÃ©
Lo Ãºnico que sÃ©, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer
