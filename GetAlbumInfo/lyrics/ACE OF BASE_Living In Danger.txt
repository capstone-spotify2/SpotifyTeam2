Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can so what you want, you can live in a dream
Get in, get up, get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own desisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running around and 'round
Without no sense of logic

I see lies
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah
You'll be living in danger
I see lies
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah
You'll be living in danger
I see lies
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah
You'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no one can reach that high
Not I nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough

In the eyes of a stranger...
