I been drinkin', I been smokin', trying to forget you
I been thinkin' every moment since the day I met you
I can't let it go right now, why you gotta go right now?
I can't let it go right now, why you gotta go right now?
Why-oh-why-oh-why?
Why-oh-why-oh-why?
Why you gotta go right now, right now?
Why you gotta go right now?
Why you gotta, why you gotta go right now?
Why-oh-why-oh-why?
Why-oh-why-oh-why?
Why you gotta go right now, right now?
Why you gotta go, go?
Why you gotta go right now?

This for my girl when she back at home
Know the times coming when I'll be out on the road
Doing what I gotta do and stacking shows
This was everything I wanted and I know you know
This is all for us this the way that I invest
Know a 401k what you getting from a desk
Trying to stack 401k off-uh doing this
By the time next years up talking nothing less
Remember renting fairgrounds for a show
Remember stressing I was venting on these hoes
Remember home never feeling like home
Now it's props everywhere I go it's outta my control
Hit my home newspaper up, they ain't even give a fuck
I'm the biggest out the town watch a year switch em up
I won't answer any calls, I don't need the love at all
I did it on my own, you're the ones who took the loss
Home made studio, self made hype
I got 10 damn albums cause my teams so tight
And my team's worldwide and my fans are too
Guerrilla with the promo stickin' like guerilla glue
Switch the flow up for the track, put the world on my back
I'ma go and see the world, then I'll bring it all back
When I'm straight with the cash we can do it all again
Call it second world tour, bringin' baby girl then

Haven't been home with the fam 9 months
Lyrics in my songs how my mothers keeping up
Phone call, Thanksgiving, know I'll see em in a month
Know I'm out here in the city I'm just tryna keep in touch
There for me from the jump
Know they got a lot of flack cause their son put a whole lotta faith in his path
Balling on the doubters, success pay 'em back
Know my parents proud of me mom bragging real fast
(I'm everything I wanted)
Can't crash now, front page, kill stage, I'm the man now
New place, same pace, I'm a stand out
Seeing old haters smiling with hands out
But you never rooted for me, know your roots they ain't part of the tree
You ain't part of the family please, so why the hell would I branch out?

Imma leave you standing with your hands out
Why the hell would I branch out?
Imma leave you standing with your hands out
Cause why in the hell would I branch out?
