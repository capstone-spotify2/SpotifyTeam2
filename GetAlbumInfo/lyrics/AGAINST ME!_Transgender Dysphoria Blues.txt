Your tells are so obvious,
Shoulders too broad for a girl.
It keeps you reminded,
Helps you remember where you come from.

You want them to notice,
The ragged ends of your summer dress.
You want them to see you
Like they see every other girl.
They just see a faggot.
They'll hold their breath not to catch the sick.

Rough surf on the coast,
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast,
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast,
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
With you.
With you.

You've got no cunt in your strut.
You've got no hips to shake.
And you know it's obvious,
But we can't choose how we're made.

You want them to notice,
The ragged ends of your summer dress.
You want them to see you
Like they see every other girl.
They just see a faggot.
They'll hold their breath not to catch the sick.

Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
With you.
With you.

You want them to notice,
The ragged ends of your summer dress.

Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
Rough surf on the coast
I wish I could've spent the whole day alone
With you.
With you.

With you.
