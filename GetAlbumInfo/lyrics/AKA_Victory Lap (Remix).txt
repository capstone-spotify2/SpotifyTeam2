<i>[Introduction - AKA &amp; Tumi:]</i>
Haaâ¦ Victory Lap Remix
You know we had to get the legends for this one right?
AKA,Ivy League all dayâ¦ Letâs go <i>[AKA]</i>
T from the V papaâ¦ <i>[Tumi]</i>
And ahâ¦ Ivy League papaâ¦ and ah <i>[AKA]</i>
Itâs big T papaâ¦ <i>[Tumi]</i>

<i>[Verse 1 - Tumi:]</i>
You donât gotta clap for a legend
You shut the fuck up,homie standard attention
Soon as my name is mentioned
They throw me a couple down,now thatâs a grand entrance
So while you claim to have the title belt
Shit I take the bottom up and put me like suspenders
Wear these loafers out like Alpha Elken
With more lines in my head than the young Nelson
Ahâ¦ welcome the hardest letter peddler just stepped in,
Respect him, no amount of that doing can help him
He first in, but the hunger get him second
And besides heâs here to help the younger settle in
T from the V Iâm in my elementâ¦ feature
Cause I felt the kid like avalanche
Yâall gonna remember this for the simple fact
Newsflash "you sunk boat victory laaaap!"
They say I settle the score, war face like Helen of Troy
Wonât break I got metal for bars, colgate flow fresher than yours
Whole place go apeship applaudâ¦
Boomâ¦

<i>[Hook:]</i>
How many rappers in world right now?
Hate it that none of them do it like I
Never get enough never get enough
Never too much V.I.C.T.O.R.Y
Hands up for my victory lapâ¦ hands up for my victory lap
(Toast to the winners)
Hands up for my victory lapâ¦ hands up for my victory lap
(if you know you a winner)

<i>[Verse 2 - AKA:]</i>
I got a brand new addiction
Studio smelling like my grand mama kitchen
Cooking hits up,plenty space cooking biscuits
Black fists pump that twenty 76 shit
Just another hit Ivy League designed
I push the Benjamin's button,Iâm ahead of my time
Iâm something like the teenage double H P
Words carry weight,thatâs a heavy sixteen
This is the land slide victory
You disfranchised through history
Course in my veins magistrate courts or the grave
Only way to get divorced from the game
A thought for my enemies we donât play fair
So pray for the day that we let them break bread
And this ones up two fingers like Gandhi
Get the haters enough rope and tell âem bhanjee

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3 - HHP:]</i>
Now pull aside for my victory lap
O fetsa ho mpona me kill die plek
A massacre by the mystery chap â¦ my name Jabula
Sweetest taboo like the band sweet back
Make the party bounce like a weak cheque
Iâm deep black I demand your respect
I pack beef like the ghetto version of Big Mack
My seeds back Iâm having my cheese snack
JT bringing six to six back
I rhyme lekker hence the boots are shaking it
Bad news to Jews like a pizza with bacon in
Now done faking and leaving the sieve for saking it
Crack open the glass this bird is for the taking now
Iâm baking like dough boy in heat wave
Iâm making the whole worlds to behave
So be brave DJ Zondi told ya
A hit skyf killing namane like spoja

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 4 - Amu:]</i>
You made one error,you took me off the list
Of the best to ever spit it on the microphone mechanics
Iâm the Grand Pa of rap,I get down and heads are sorted
What? You running this game? No wonder rap is being aborted
A rap vet,Iâm selling fire to a dragon
I made a profit gave it back to all these has-beens
I took my back pack and traded it in for fashion
I gotta look fresh for it the finish lines Iâm passing
Mad sparks Iâm addressing
Represent ikasi lakho boy time for action
Get your hood up in arms like Christ of passion
Or just grab a drink with the fruit of passion
They called me up to come do what I do best
To make sure rappers play safe like new sex
Itâs the beginning of the ending,give me credit
Iâm demanding reprehension while Iâm at it
The principalâ¦

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Hands up for my victory lapâ¦ hands up for my victory lap
(Toast to the winners)
Hands up for my victory lapâ¦ hands up for my victory lap
(if you know you a winner)
