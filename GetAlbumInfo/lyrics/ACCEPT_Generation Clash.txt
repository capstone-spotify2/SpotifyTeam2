Generation clash - Generation clash

Warnings around me
Coming on strong
Hear the desire
That young dudes are fools

But systems will berak down
The way they all do
A general burden
When ever we're through

Powers are freezing
The way that they are
They're fornicating
With each others minds

Typical outcome in whatever we do
We stand on our own rebellion the groove

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - we got the guts to go

They're blaming our music
Say we're wasting time
The fever's been itching
While we stand in line

'cause you're always bitching
You can't hold back the time

Searching for treasure or something to hold
We'll find our pleasure in the cast you mold

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - and so the story goes
Generation Clash - ain't gonna wipe my nose
Generation Clash - ain't got the time to know

Hey Mom                                      (Generation)
Have you always followed the golden rule     (Clash)
'cause this just happens to be my first love (Generation)
And that being                               (Clash)
A must - a must                              (Generation)
That being playin' my guitar                 (Clash)

We try to follow your golden rule
Don't seem to matter we ain't from your school
We tries to reason tried to turn it inside out
Without no compromising my guitar will scream out loud - oh

Generation Clash
Generation Clash - that's how the story goes
Generation Clash - and only time will show
Generation Clash - You gotta gotta let me go
