Well, I've been on the wrong side
Of the front door too often
Watched you slam it in my face
Well I may learn the hard way
I'm not a soft one
Tonight I'm standin' in your place

'Cause you taught me a lot about leavin'
Won't even have to try
So here's your lesson in heartache and grievin'
And a chance for you to cry
'Cause it's time you learned about good-bye

I've stood behind you
And I've laid beside you
But I won't do that anymore
'Cause I'm tired of bein'
Just here when you want me
Tonight I'm walkin' out that door

'Cause you taught me a lot about leavin'
Won't even have to try
So here's your lesson in heartache and grievin'
And a chance for you to cry
It's time you learned about good-bye

You taught me a lot about leavin'
Won't even have to try
So here's your lesson in heartache and grievin'
And a chance for you to cry
It's time you learned about good-bye

Yeah, you taught me a lot about leavin'
Won't even have to try
So here's your lesson in heartache and grievin'
And a chance for you to cry
'Cause it's time you learned about good-bye

It's time you learned about good-bye
It's time you learned about good-bye
