U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this, come on
U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on

Does that sound a little serious to you
Has Aaron Carter turned red, white and blue
I've been rollin' like this since day one
But I never bring it on in your face
I have fun. There's a time to get down
And no time to clown around
Right about now time fix the frown
Face to face and body to body
We're gonna pull through
Come on everybody

Troubled times bring
About troubled vibes
I chill you out, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Nobody gonna stop our dream

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on
It's where I'm from
And where I'm at
I'm feeling proud
That I got it like that
Ain't no distance we'll take it like that
The grassy ain't green ah ah
Forget that
From the valleys to the hill to the town
All the friends and fam mama you know
Everybody come together make a half black
White Spanish Chinese
Show me what you got
Troubled times bring
About troubled vibes
I chill you out, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dream

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on
U... S... A...

Bang your heads to this come on

Bang your heads to this, come on
