Do know why winter's such a cold and lonely place?
If you do, breathe it in to my bleached faces
Falling far, the sheets of my bed disappear
I hear the clock, strikes up prettily at the hours
I wear the path deeper following you
Girl, I knew comes tired home from another working day
Cooks a meal, puts the stove on and sees the snow
Falling far, a white painted sky drifting by
And here I come in through the door
I say hello and very little more
Did she love me any more?
Do you know why winter's such a cold and lonely place?
I'm laughing at the weather
I'm sure it reminded me of something
It took me years and years to forget
Do you love me any more?
