I can think of younger days when to live for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow 

How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down? (tell me)
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man? (yeah)
How can a loser ever win? 
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow 
Would you believe that no one
No one ever told us about the sorrow (so)

How can you mend a broken heart? (and mine is)
How can you stop the rain from falling down? (baby)
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go round? (and sometime I have to say, yeah)

(Tell me)
Help me mend my  broken heart 
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna live again, baby

How can you mend this broken man? (yeah, somebody tell me)
How can a loser ever win? (baby)
Help me mend my... This old broken heart 
I think I, I believe I
I feel like I got to, I feel like I wanna live again

How can you mend this broken heart? (somebody please tell me)
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
(I wanna know. I know my my clothes are all wet, tell me) 
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I've got a feeling that I want to live and live and live
