right from the beginning
clouds began to form
but we were all too young
to feel the power of the storm
if we had lost our hopes
we know our dreams would still remain
because nothing is impossible
and nothing burns like
fire in the rain

thunder rocked the mountains
lightening cracked the sky
no one that survived this hurricane
would dare deny
if fate had played it's part
there would be nothing to explain
what was once a very tiny spark
is now a blazing fire in the rain

now - see the sun - coming out
from behind the darkest clouds
say goodbye - to the storm
as it moves across the sky
see the fire - burning brighter
than it ever has before
move in close - touch the flame
burn like fire in the rain
