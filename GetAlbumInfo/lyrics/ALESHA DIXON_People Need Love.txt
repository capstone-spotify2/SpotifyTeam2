Make me strong enough to fly
Brave enough to fall
The energy decline my way over your walls
Make me, just make me everything
Make me unforgettable like your favourite song
If that's impossible, don't know if I'll go on
Make me, just make me everything, yeah

People need good times, memories
People need true friends, family
People like heartache, crying
Rather than love, love love
People need sunlight and clear skies
People need moonlight and sunrise
People like no hope and dull nights
Rather than love, love, love

Happiness don't leave, I follow where you go
You can take the lead, I can play the role
Make me, just make me everything
Take your time with me, I maybe the one
Cause when you come around, I feel just like a child
Make me, just make me everything, make me everything

Cause people need good times, memories
People need true friends, family
People like heartache, crying
Rather than love, love love
People need sunlight and clear skies
People need moonlight and sunrise
People like no hope and dull nights
Rather than love, love, love

People need love
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love
People we all need love
I said la-la-la-la-la-love
All my people, yeah, you know we need love (sing)
La-la-la-la-la-love
People, yeah, we all need love
Love, love
People need love
