Have you ever wished for something like
A second chance to make things right
To stop the clock, return to where you've been
In a world that's spinning out of control
We spend our days searching our souls
For answers to the questions lost back then

Now higher and higher I've built up this wall
Reaching to heaven, can you hear me call?

Take me back, take me back
Life is passing by so fast
Take me back. take me back
I want to make each moment last
If I could start all over
Knowing what I know now that I'm older
My future is past so take me back

Through all the years of hurt and pain,
I'd re live each to love again
To find the ones who might have got away
Now higher and higher I've built up this wall.
Reaching to heaven, can you hear me call?

Take me back, take me back
Life is passing by so fast
Take me back. take me back
I want to make each moment last
If I could start all over
Knowing what I know now that I'm older
My future is past so take me back

Oh.....I'm counting the stars in the sky
Just to make sure that I'm still alive
Cause I don't want to run out of time
Before I've even tried

Take me back, take me back
Life is passing by so fast
Take me back. take me back
I want to make each moment last

Take me back, take me back
Life is passing by so fast
Take me back. take me back
I want to make each moment last
If I could start all over
Knowing what I know now that I'm older
My future is past so take me back
