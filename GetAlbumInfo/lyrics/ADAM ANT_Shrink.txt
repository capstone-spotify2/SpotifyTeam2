Good Morning mister, how are you?
Are we sleeping the whole night through
Or Hearing voices in the hall!
I have the Shots but it's your call
Good morning mister, hows it been?
Your Daily breads a daily Sin

A fist in the skulls worth two in the bush
You're feeling lucky right now
Or does your brain need a push?
Is it just me or is it just medication?

Good Morning mister, hows it been?
Your daily breads a daily sin
Look at the mighty how they fall
I have the shots but it's your call
Your fifty minutes is up up up up

A fist in the skulls worth two in the bush
You're feeling lucky right now
Or does your brain need a push?
Is it just me or is it just medication?

Your fifteen minutes is up up up up
A fist in the skulls worth two in the bush
Your feeling lucky right now
Or does your brain need a push?
Is it just me or is it just medication? medication
