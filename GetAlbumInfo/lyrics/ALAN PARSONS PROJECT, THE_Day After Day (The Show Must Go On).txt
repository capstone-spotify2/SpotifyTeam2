Gaze at the sky
And picture a memory
Of days in your life.
You knew what it meant to be happy and free
With time on your side...

Remember your daddy
When no one was wiser.
Your ma used to say
That you would go farther than he ever could
With time on your side...

Think of a boy with the stars in his eyes,
Longing to reach them but frightened to try.
Sadly you'd say someday, someday...

But day after day
The show must go on,
And time slipped away
Before you could build any castles in Spain...
The chance had gone by.

With nothing to say
And no one to say it to,
Nothing has changed.
You still got it all to do,
Surely you know.
The chance has gone by...

Think of a boy with the stars in his eyes,
Longing to reach them but frightened to try.
Sadly you'd say someday, someday...

But day after day
The show must go on,
And you gaze at the sky
And picture a memory of days in your life
With time on your side...

With time on your side...
(Day after day the show must go on...)
With time on your side...
(Day after day the show must go on...)
With time on your side...
