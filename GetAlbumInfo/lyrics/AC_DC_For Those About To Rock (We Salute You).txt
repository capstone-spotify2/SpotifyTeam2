We roll tonight to the guitar bite

Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
Hail hail to the good times
Cos rock has got the right of way
We ain't no legends ain't no cause
We're just livin' for today
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you

We rock at dawn on the front line
Like a bolt right outta the blue
The skies alight with a guitar bite
Heads will roll and rock tonight
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you, yes we do
For those about to rock, we salute you
Salute

We're just a battery for hire with the guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
For a twenty one gun salute
For those about to rock
Fire
We salute you
For those about to rock
We salute you
For those about to rock
Fire
We salute you
Fire
We salute you

We salute you, c'mon
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
For those who give
For those who take
Those left high
And those on the make
We salute you
We salute you
We salute you

Fire
