Time went by don't know why I'm trying 
Took too long things went wrong now you're gone 

I wish we met when we were young 
No longer now, we burned up like the sun
Tainted body, mind &amp; soul
I wish we'd known before we lost control 

I waste my time on you &amp; no matter what I do 
you're the voice inside my head
I'm so sick of all your lies &amp; no matter how hard 
I try I think it's time for this to die 

The silence it's haunting 
My demons inside 
They creep up
They taunt me 
I can't choose a side
I kick and I scream 
A means to an end
We started as lovers
But ended not friends now 

You
You wanted him to be me
What do I get from this
Still the same old shit 
Not suffering but
Damn where do I stand
Am I God or am I man
You understand?

Are you lying awake
Does it hurt you to see
This fucking cross I bare
So bow down to me 

This hell is reserved
My palace is burnt
A longing for freedom 
A place to desert me 

Fuck
This house that we built 
Felt like a prison you found
No one holding you in 
But you still burned it fucking down
