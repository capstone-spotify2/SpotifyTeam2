I took a hit of your love and held it deep inside
And calculated the reasons you keep me satisfied
All for you
It's like this noose is our love, around my neck so tight
I think I'm losing consciousness
I think I'm losing my mind for you

But in the middle of what we had was gone
We cannot falter now, no
Even when I'm gone away
You won't ever see this throne
It's where you rest your head

Oh lord it feels so nice
You've got me paralyzed baby
You, you won't ever be alone
You won't ever see it again, no
Unless you ring the alarm
You, you won't ever be

The beat goes
On and on forever
As the beat goes on we're haunted by the sound
Boom boom, broken heart
Ghost of a lover gone
Aww I don't wanna be apart, girl
I don't wanna sing that song

But the beat goes
On and on forever
Like a record on repeat comes back around
Boom boom, got that spark
Eyes of a lover caught
Aww you don't wanna be alone, girl
Dancing in the dark

Because I want you to know
I still believe we can never make it alone
Even when you kept deceiving me
I knew that we'd always grow
Because after it all
We gotta move on, yeah we gotta stay strong
Like the beat of this song, like the beat of this song
Oh we're living in a world where love is the goal
We've living in a world where love is ending

Oh lord it feels so nice
You've got me paralyzed baby
You, you won't ever be alone
You won't ever see it again, no
Unless you ring the alarm
You, you won't ever be
