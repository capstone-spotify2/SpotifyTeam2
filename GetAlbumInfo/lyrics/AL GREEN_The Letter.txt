Give me a ticket for an airplane 
I ain't got time to take a fast train 
Oh ,the lonely days are gone 
I'll be right home 
My baby she wrote me a letter 

I don't care how much money I got to spend 
I won't find my way home again 
Oh the lonely days are gone 
I'll be right home 
My baby, she wrote me a letter 

She wrote me a letter 
Said she couldn't live with out me no more 
Listen to me mister I gotta get back to
My baby once more 
Anyway 

Give me a ticket for an airplane 
I ain't got time to take no fast train 
Oh, the lonely days are gone 
I'll be back home 
My baby she wrote me a letter 

She wrote me a letter 
Said she couldn't live with out me no more 
Listen to me mister I gotta get back to
My baby once more 
Anyway 

Give me a ticket for an airplane 
I ain't got time to take no fast train 
Oh ,the lonely days are gone 
I'll be back home
