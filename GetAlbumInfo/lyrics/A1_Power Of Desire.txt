<i>[Chris:]</i> Fallin' for a fantasy
I threw away my destiny
I don't know where to stop
Feelin' broken-hearted

I'll think about it
And to see my eyes 
To cry to dry
for I've forced
All this time <i>[2x]</i>
With you, ooh...

<i>[Chris:]</i> I was tempted by the power of desire
I surrendered to the calling of the fire
There's nothing I could ever say
to change the things I did
But I promise you
I'll make it up to you

<i>[Mark:]</i> Take me back to yesterday
When all our dreams were swept away
I'd never crossed that line
I changed across of time

I could never live this way
If only you'd forgive
We'll start again
With all my heart
All my love for you <i>[2x]</i>

<i>[Mark &amp; Chris: (chorus)]</i>

<i>[break]</i>

<i>[Mark &amp; Chris:]</i> No surrender no return
If only you believe that...
