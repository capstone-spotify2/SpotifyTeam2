Rain`s falling down
Turning everybody weaken
Can you see the pain
Spreading all over in vain

People just cry
Drowning all the world in tears of lie
Can you see them too
All of them cold and untrue

I`m a true believer in my heart
Living every second from the start
Can you feel the love I sent to you
I will live today like lovers do â¦ <i>[x2]</i>
