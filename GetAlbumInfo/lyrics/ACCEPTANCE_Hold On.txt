Now I know that it's the same.
Different people, different days.
It won't change.
Do you find security?
Knowing you have broken me.
Like a pastime.

Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.
Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.

Is popularity your quest?
Is this game the perfect test?
Do we all? Do we alter?
What we are. Who we honor.
Playing with people's hearts?

Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.
Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.

I find myself, alone again.
I don't want to find myself alone again.

Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.
Hold on and you'll find,
What you're eventually looking for.

Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. 
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
