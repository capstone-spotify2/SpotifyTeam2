Sitting here on the horizon
Waiting for the moon to rise
Love has a way of arriving
Out of the clear blue sky

Ooo, I love you
Don't you know it's true
When you believe in something good
It always comes through
Always comes true

Last year was harder
Think I'll settle down for a while
And the peaks of the mountains are glowing
And the canyons echo your smile

Ooo I love you
Don't you know it's true?
When you believe in something good
It aways comes through
Always comes true

You are there to catch each tear
Every time I fail
How can I give back each year
Tell you I... I....
I believe

Ooo I love you
Don't you know it's true
When you believe in something good
It always comes through
Ooo I love you
Don't you know it's true
When you believe in something good
It always comes through
Always comes true

It always comes true.
