<i>[Chorus]</i>
Realizing livin life for me, always gettin into trouble
Cuz, im so fly
Im on a whole nother level
Left the block, and now im smiling countin money like
Realizing livin life for me, i done found another hustle
Cuz, im so fly
Im living life a lot better
Still keep a glock in case the jailers wanna hate tonight

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Another day up in the hood, cant believe these cats still bangin (bangin)
Look at the years we wasted, on the corner block still slangin (slagin)
No matter how much we try to make peace, gun shots still rangin (rangin)
Cuz to be a hood legend, you die first, then become famous
Cuz i done seen this type of thing before
Just hangin out by the corner store
Stick up kids wit them guns galore
Layin there, body down, stretched on the floor
I thought about it, man im way too fly
To have a fella robbin me outside
Thats why i keep that thing by my side
And down every blessin while im screamin out

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
I hate to say it but the people that surrounding me
Are way too shady
The only people i can trust is my family and my lady
All my dogs got guns
Ready for action
They wont betray me
Your the type to run
Or to hold my tongue
When it gets crazy
See i been through this type of thing before
Even had trouble with the law
On the couch when the smash my door
But they wont find the cash stashed under the floor
I never could understand the problem
I was the one to pull the shoulders drop
Couldnt live this type of life no more
So i had a part of me screamin out

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 3]</i>
Im in blue, wit them BF frames
Walkin on lean, while mind chain hangs
Drivin somethin, pronounce mad strange
Never mad cool, cuz i been through flames
Walk wit a limp, cuz i been through games
Now shes a ho, cuz she been through gangs
Beef wit ghats for a small chunk change
Im rich now, thats more chunk change
The cops know slang
Man get the picture before u out the frame
Call me heart throb, cuz im so fame
Couldnt come close if u sat in my Range
My scars can prove but im passion and pain

<i>[Chorus]</i>
