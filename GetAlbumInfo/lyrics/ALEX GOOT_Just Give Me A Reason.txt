Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That werenât all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now youâve been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that youâve had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bitâs enough
Just a second weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Itâs in the stars
Itâs been written in the scars on our hearts
Weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Iâm sorry I donât understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythinâ
And itâs all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happeninâ)

Youâve been havinâ real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
Thereâs nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bitâs enough
Just a second weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
Youâre still written in the scars on my heart
Youâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
Iâll fix it for us
Weâre collecting dust
But our loveâs enough
Youâre holding it in
Youâre pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
Weâll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bitâs enough
Just a second weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Itâs in the stars
Itâs been written in the scars on our hearts
That weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bitâs enough
Just a second weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Itâs in the stars
Itâs been written in the scars on our hearts
That weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, oh, that weâre not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
