Blood for the scars, and the stars and the stripes on my hand
And they been telling me I'm lost, double crossed, that I don't understand, 
But when everyone's running
That's when I will stand
We'll be together
Until the end

We're undivided
We're bound by a thousands days
We're undivided
We belong each and every way
If they could just see us
No daylight between us
That'll never change (that'll never change)
When everyone's left you
Whatever you been through
I will remain (I will remain)
We're undivided. 

Push through the adds, words were said, only healing remains
And I know you know me best, all my joys, all my flaws, all my pain
One in a million
Through thick and thin
This is a life time
We're choosing to spend

We're undivided, We're bound by a thousands days
We're undivided, We belong each and every way
If they could just see us
No daylight between us
That'll never change (that'll never change)
When everyone's left you, 
Whatever you been through
I will remain (I will remain)

Yes, you and I (you and I)
You never gonna let you go (never gonna let you go)
Yes, you and I (you and I)
I'll love you more then you'll ever know, 

We're undivided, We're bound by a thousands days. 
We're undivided, We belong, each and every way
If they could just see us, 
No daylight between us, 
That'll never change (That'll never change)
When everyone's left you
Whatever you been through
I will remain (I will remain)
We're undivided
