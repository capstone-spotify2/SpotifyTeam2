Baby baby you don't understand
How much I love you baby
How much I wanna be your only man
And baby baby baby you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, I wanna talk to you just a little more

I see the little tears in your eyes, about to fall
you are wondering, if I'm for real

But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this how I feel
Oh, baby I'm for real

but if you wanna know the truth about it
Girl I just cant live without it and that's why I'm professing my love to you
so I can live my lif with you

Baby I'm for real
Baby wipe the tears from your eyes
Now you wont have to cry no more
Baby I'm for real

Take to the sky on a natural high
loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you kissing you telling you why

But if you cry, I wonder why you cry

Oh, baby I'm for real 

But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this how I feel
Oh, baby I'm for real
