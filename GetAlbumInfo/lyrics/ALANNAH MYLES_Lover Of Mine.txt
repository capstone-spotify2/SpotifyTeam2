Why do I feel like I'm losing you
Will it ever become what I've always wanted it to
You tell me I'm the lucky one
How can you say that when it breaks my heart to see another woman with you
Oh-oh, lover of mine
Oh-oh-oh, lover of mine
When it hurts so bad I wanna hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine
After we've said all there is to say
Am I still in you heart or am I just in your way
My desire for you is running wild
Jealousy, the dangerous kind, when I see you lookin' at another woman that way
Oh-oh, lover of mine
Oh-oh-oh, lover of mine
When it hurts so bad I wanna hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine
Please, set me free or give me your reason
For tryin' to keep it alive
There is no need for us to be lonely
Gimme some kinda hope, I'm walking a fine line
Oh-oh, lover of mine
Oh-oh-oh, lover of mine
When it hurts so bad I wanna hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine
