See you everyday on the morning bus 
You seem a little sad and lonely 
I try to look away but when you pass my seat 
I always hope that you will see me 

Wish I could let you know 
how I feel before you have to go. 

I want to hold you, make it come true 
give all my loving but I don't even know you. 
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain 
and say I love you but I don't even know your name. 

I can't help myself I'm going slightly mad 
I slip a note into your pocket 
And I'll wait all night for the phone to ring 
I wonder if you got the message 

We might not be meant to be 
but I hope time will tell differently 

I want to hold you, make it come true 
give all my loving but I don't even know you. 
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain 
and say I love you but I don't even know your name. 

Now we are perfect strangers 
No one's sitting next to you 
Will I have the strength to pull it through
