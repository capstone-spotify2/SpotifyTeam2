I want to believe
If you tell me so
I want to believe
'Cause you oughta know
That kicking is hard
But the bottom's harder
So I'm taking your card

But I cannot get my head around it, baby
I cannot get my head around it, baby
'Cause that's just not the way
You make me feel

I want to believe
But, baby, I'm dry
I want to believe
But you testify
And I'll pour the drinks
Like a true believer
Whose god never blinks

But I cannot get my head around it, baby
I cannot get my head around it, baby
'Cause that's just not the way
You make me feel
No, that's just not the way
You make me feel
No, that's just not the way
You make me feel

Like way more real than real
The world inside the glass
That struggles to conceal
The wreckage on the overpass

I cannot get my head
I cannot get my head
I cannot get my head around it, baby
'Cause that's just not the way
You make me feel
No, that's just not the way
You make me feel
No, that's just not the way
You make me feel
