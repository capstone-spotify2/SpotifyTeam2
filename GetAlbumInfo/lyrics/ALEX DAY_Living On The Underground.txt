Listen to the gasping as it rips away
Slam against the wall because you got no say
Bodies all around you so you canât escape
Feel like they could turn and crawl into my brain

Living on the underground
Guess itâs time to put you down
Never gonna let you out
Nobody can make a sound

Shake a little longer and youâll lose your mind
Donât think you can get to either door in time
Panic when you feel the heat between your eyes
Holding on to anything that you can find

You're living on the underground
Guess itâs time to put you down
Never gonna let you out
Nobody can make a sound

Pick up every whisper when the airâs so thin
People treating you as if you mean nothing
Hitting all the senses making your head spin
Crowds and crowds and crowds and crowds
And crowds and crowds and crowds and crowds
And crowds and crowds and crowds and crowds are packing in

Living on the underground
Guess itâs time to put you down
Never gonna let you out
Nobody can make a sound

You're living on the underground
Guess itâs time to put you down
Never gonna let you out
Nobody can make a sound
