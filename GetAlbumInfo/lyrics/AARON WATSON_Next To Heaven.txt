Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
Next to heaven, it doesn't get any better than this

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Next to heaven lies my fate, my best friend and my sole mate
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
You're the answer to my prayers, nothing else compare
I'm next to heaven when I am next to you

You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
Next to heaven, it doesn't get any better than this

<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
