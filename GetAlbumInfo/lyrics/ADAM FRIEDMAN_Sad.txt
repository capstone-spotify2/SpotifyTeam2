Sometimes, I'm standing right here, but nobody see me
Like a little boy, in the middle of the sea
Why did the blue sky turn its back on me?
What are we missing?
Hard, it hit me

Suddenly, I'm feeling all kinds of feelings
Mama said, she said it's alright to feel 'em
When you got tears streaming down that's when you feel the realest
Whether it's good or it's bad
It's OK to be sad
Sometimes

It's OK to be sad
It's OK to be sad

Sometimes, there'll be bad news on my welcome mat
Trouble keeps calling, but I ain't calling back
Why does the midnight gotta treat me like that?
Oooh, but I don't mind, yeah I'll be just fine

Suddenly, I'm feeling all kinds of feelings
Mama said, she said it's alright to feel 'em
When you got tears streaming down that's when you feel the realest
Whether it's good or it's bad
It's OK to be sad
Sometimes

It's OK to be sad
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
It's OK to be sad
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
It's OK to be sad
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
It's OK to be sad

Suddenly, I'm feeling all kinds of feelings
And Mama said, she said it's alright to feel 'em
When you got tears streaming down that's when you feel the realest
Whether it's good or it's bad
It's OK to be sad
Sometimes

Well, it's OK
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
It's OK
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
Yeah
It's OK
Yeah
It's OK to be, OK to be
Yeah, It's OK to be sad, sometimes
