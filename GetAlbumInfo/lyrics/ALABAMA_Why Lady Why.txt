Why lady why, can't I leave you alone
I try lady try, but the feeling's too strong
You stay on my mind, feel just like a fool
Why lady why, can't I get over you

Why lady why, it was easy before
I try lady try, but it ain't easy no more
To be on my way, would be the best thing to do
Why lady why, can't I get over you

Why lady why, can't I leave you alone
I try lady try, but the feeling's too strong
To be on my way, would be the best thing to do
Why lady why, can't I get over you...
