Did you find the way to tell me how you feel?
I wanna understand exactly what you feel
You were here before when all the walls closed in
Now it's here I find just what you feel for me

Miserable romance
There's nothing but broken hearts
Love isn't perfect
We're perfect the way we are

Did you think you found the perfect thing to say?
<i>[?]</i>
Screaming now
Now it's here I find just what you feel for me

Miserable romance
There's nothing but broken hearts
Love isn't perfect
We're perfect the way we are
<i>[x2]</i>

Perfect the way we are
This could be amazing
Now you've played <i>[?]</i> tear us apart
The way we are, way we are

Miserable romance
There's nothing but broken hearts
Love isn't perfect
We're perfect the way we are
