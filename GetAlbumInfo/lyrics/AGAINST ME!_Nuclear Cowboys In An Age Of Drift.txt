This is the dumbest movie that I've ever seen
The outcome is predictable
And the casting is so obvious and transparent
Acting for transparent politicians
And with out without your vote, well the election's going to happen
I know it burns in your stomach to feel so cheated
It burns in your stomach to feel there's nothing you can do about it

So we laugh together in the same cynical way
And we'll talk about it in the same beaten down way
And nothing changes

These are the same choices that we've always had
It's the same rhetoric
It's the same campaign promises
Oh, you don't have to buy what they're selling
'Cause with or without your vote, one of these candidates will take office
And everybody's praying to go numb
Everybody's got the same excuses
There's nothing they can do about it

So we laugh together in the same cynical way
And talk about it in the same beaten down way
We laugh together in the same cynical way
We talk about it in the same beaten down way
And nothing changes
Nothing ever changes
