Na-na-na-na

Tonight, here I am, there you are
This is the good life, looking up at the stars
You know its our time, cause we're here and in love
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing

So we're young and we got some dirty minds
Ripped jeans with a bottle for the night
We're the kids who would bring the world to life
So we're dumb and we got some time to waste
Got it all with a pocketful of change
Tonight, gonna make our best mistake

Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
You'll never have to be alone

Moonlight, it's a shot in the dark but it's a good time
Yeah, we're making our mark
And if it feels right, take a piece of my heart
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing

So we're young and we got some dirty minds
Ripped jeans with a bottle for the night
We're the kids who would bring the world to life
So we're dumb and we got some time to waste
Got it all with a pocketful of change
Tonight, gonna make our best mistake

Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
You'll never have to be alone
Take me there
Take me there
Take me there
Take me there

Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Na-na-na-na
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Na-na-na-na
Take me there
Take me there

Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
You'll never have to be alone
Take me there
Take me there
Take me there
Take me there
