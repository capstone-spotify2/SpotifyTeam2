Martin was bright as he stood up and sang in the choir
His heart all in pieces was breaking; his head was on fire
They took him from that place and they buried him deep in the ground
Out with the light and quiet the sound

And it's a slow revolution that quietly turns
As the true word burns
And all of the people marching together out 'cross the floor
And all that was after is now as it was before

Now Sylvia sat staring out in the depths of a room
A moment of light from her brain cut through the dark and pierced the gloom
Children's voices were music, came faint through the wall
From such a great height she looked down; it was only the fall

And it's a slow revolution that quietly turns
As the true word burns
And all of the people marching, stomping out 'cross the floor
And all that was after is now as it was before

So look at the shadows bent forward, trying to break through the night
Huddled against the darkness, so close to the light
My voice is breaking out here in this wilderness

For I see a time that is coming; I see a time of change
The sun is burning the deserts but water's filling the plains
Noah is crazily chipping away at his ark
While all of us ready ourselves to go into the dark

And it's a slow revolution that quietly turns
As the true word burns
And all of the people marching, dancing out 'cross the floor
And all of this matter soon won't matter much anymore
