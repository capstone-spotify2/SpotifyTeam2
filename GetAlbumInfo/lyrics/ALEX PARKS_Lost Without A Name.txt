Nobody knows this girls name, she hides behind, 
A broken wall of secrets, she built with time, 
And as you drop your change, do you see her eyes? 
She seems lost without a name, a child who's lost her way, 
She made ways to be found, she doesn't hear the sound of her mother cry, don't even come home, and don't
You be alone, she said goodbye, so long ago. 

Nobody wants this girls name, bruise and life stained, 
There's more than you can see there, she cry's tears of pain, 
And as you drop your change, do you see her eyes? 
She seems lost without a name, a child who's lost her way, 
She made ways to be found, she doesn't hear the sound of her mother cry, don't even come home, and don't
You be alone, she said goodbye, so long ago.

She doesn't hear the sound of her mother cry, don't even come home, and don't you be alone, she said
Goodbye, so long ago.
