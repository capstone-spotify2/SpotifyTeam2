Holy girl 
Don't get up 
For running 

Stay with me 
I feel sad 
When you run 

Sands of time 
Are lying 
On my chest 

Stay in bed 
I feel sad 
When you run 

Stay like this 
On the hills 
Of my chest 

Don't wake up 
I feel strange 
When you go 

Stop the night 
Hold me tight 
Holy girl 

Don't stand up 
I feel strange 
When you go
