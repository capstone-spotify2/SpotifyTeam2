Pain is being lost
It's being me
Losing the ones I love
Pain is watching my mama cry
Just can't stop her tears
It's what I inflict on myself
Pain is how I feel
Can't keep pretending it's gonna be alright

Cause I don't need this love
When it hurts so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't enough
I feel abandoned
Stranded
Lonely won't you wake me
From this dream

Pain is
Losing hope
When there's no way out
And nobody's home
Pain is just part of me
Feeling helpless inside
It's everything that I believe
When I've got nowhere to hide
Can't stop the emptiness even if I try

Cause I don't need this love
When it hurts so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't enough
I feel abandoned
Stranded
Lonely won't you help me Mama
Soulless
Hopeless
Mama won't you wake me from this dream

Does anybody hear me
Can anybody hear me
Cause I don't even know which way to go
Can anybody hear me
Can anybody feel me
Can't keep pretending it's gonna be alright

Cause I don't need this love
When it hurts so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't enough
I feel abandoned
Stranded
Lonely won't you help me Mama
Soulless
Hopeless
Mama won't you wake me from this dream
