Mmm. don't she look good on the floor movin' so slow, mmhmm
Look how she's lookin' at him and dancin' so close.
There's not a man in the crowd
Who wouldn't like to hold her right now.

I taught her everything she's knows about love
So why is she lookin' at him like I ain't enough
I wonder if I didn't teach her a little too much
'Cause, I taught her everything she knows about love.

Well, someone just sent her a note with a bottle of wine
When I asked who it was from she just said, "honey it wasn't signed."
Maybe I shouldn't give it much thought
But I know how well she's been taught.

I taught her everything she's knows about love
So why is she lookin' at him like I ain't enough
I wonder if I didn't teach her a little too much
'Cause, I taught her everything she knows about love.

I'm used to guys lookin' at her
But now she's lookin' too
I taught her everything about love
Now she's lookin' to find somethin' new.

I taught her everything she's knows about love
So why is she lookin' at him like I ain't enough
I wonder if I didn't teach her a little too much
'Cause, I taught her everything she knows about love.

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

I taught her everything she's knows about love.

I taught her everything she's knows about love
So why is she lookin' at him like I ain't enough
I wonder if I didn't teach her a little too much
'Cause, I taught her everthing she knows about love.
