Oh!
What u want?
Alright now remember that
Ha-ha ha-ha
Introducing
Stand up

Super fly, black hair
Swinging out everywhere
I touched you and my heart stopped
Now I know I'm totally fucked

I'm gonna take you in my car
Let you give me a ride
And tell me now quick or slow
I'll let you decide
And if you get too serious
I'll tell you goodbye
Girl you better realize

This ain't nothing but a
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by, drive by
I drive by lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by love

We went a little too fast
You threw me back on my ass (Oh)
I can't believe I did this
Let it happen with a just one kiss

So tell me what'd you do
if it happened to you?

Would you wanna give it up
or would you follow it through?
And I fell in love and now I'm totally screwed
I guess I should've realized

This is more than just a
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by, drive by
I drive by lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by love

Oh!

Coming up, I'm coming up
Coming up, I'm coming up

So tell me what'd you do
if it happen to you?
Would you wanna give it up
or would you follow it through?
And I fell in love and now I'm totally screwed
I guess I should've realized

It's not a drive by love
lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I drive by love
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by love (Hey-hey)
Drive by, drive by
