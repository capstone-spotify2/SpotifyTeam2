Lean against the night and laugh as I try to scale the walls.
Ingnored futility fills the air. You're only there to watch me fall...
If only pure sweetness was offered, why's this bitter taste left in my mouth?
If I could catch my breath just to exhale, I'd know that I held it in to long...
From above comes a faint smile, a new vantage such a view. Familiarity know disowned.
Just sit and stare as I walk away.
