If I give you what you wanted, can you keep it off the record?
And when I turn on the camera, tell me, can you take direction? Perfection
You know the suite is presidential, you 'bout to get elected
Yeah, in the morning we can sip champagne and I'mma eat you up for breakfast, delicious (Let me give it to ya)

Two times, you know I love that, love that, love that
Thick thighs, you know I love that, love that, love that
Talk nasty, girl I love that, love that, love that, love that
Back up on me,  I love that, love that, love that

All around the world, it's your turn
We can take our time, this is slow burn
Pop another pill, never sober
Baby, plannin' on leaving your life 'round midnight
Gone, gone, gone already
Baby we'll be gone, gone already
Gone already

In the morning we'll be gone
In the morning we'll be gone
You already know
In the morning we'll be gone

Baby I don't wanna rush you, you know you control the tempo
Yeah, bet you like it when I touch ya (I do), blow your mind just like a whistle, official
No we ain't gotta complicate things, just keep it nice and simple (nice and simple, nice and simple)
That's how we do it, how we do it all day, baby girl you got potential (If you want the info, I'mma give it to ya)

Two times, you know I love that, love that, love that
Thick thighs, you know I love that, love that, love that
Talk nasty, girl I love that, love that, love that, love that
Back up on me,  I love that, love that, love that

All around the world, it's your turn
We can take our time, this is slow burn
Pop another pill, never sober
Baby, plannin' on leaving your life 'round midnight
Gone, gone, gone already
Baby we'll be gone, gone already
Gone already

In the morning we'll be gone
In the morning we'll be gone
You already know
In the morning we'll be gone girl
In the morning we'll be gone
In the morning we'll be gone
In the morning we'll be gone
You know, you know, gone
