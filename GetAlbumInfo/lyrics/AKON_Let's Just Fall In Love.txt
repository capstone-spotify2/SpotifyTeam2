No more wasting time, no, no
No more excuses, excuses
I'm gonna take into this time, oyeah,
This picture has never been so clear,
Sorry that it took so long for me to come around,
But now that I'm here,
Let's not waste no more time,
I finally got it right, I'm no longer scared
And it's supposed to be that you're right next to me,
There is nothing to fear,

So here's a cool idea
Let's just fall in love, love, in love, love, in love, love
Let's just fall in love, love, in love, love, in love, love
There must be a first time for everything,
Your exceptions to how I feel
You'll be my first and be my last,
Let's just fall in love

I've never felt this way before, no, no,
There's always been confusions,
Seems like I found your love and now I know,
This time it's for certain,
Sorry that it took so long for me to come around,
But now that I'm here,
Let's not waist no more time,
I finally got it right, I'm no longer scared
And it's supposed to be that you're right next to me,
There is nothing to fear,

So here's a cool idea
Let's just fall in love, love, in love, love, in love, love
Let's just fall in love, love, in love, love, in love, love
There must be a first time for everything,
Your exceptions to how I feel
You'll be my first and be my last,
Let's just fall in love

I never thought that I could feel this way,
Never thought that I could feel this way,
I never thought that I could feel this way,
Never thought that I could feel this way,
I never thought that I could feel this way,
Never thought that I could feel this way,
I never thought that I could feel this way,
Never thought that I could feel this way,
