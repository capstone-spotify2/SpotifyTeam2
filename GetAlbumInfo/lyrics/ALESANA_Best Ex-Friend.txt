Pretty words roll off of your tongue
Come out of your mouth heard by everyone
So convincing I believed it
For so long I still can't figure out
Why many wont last, why many wont last
With the blink of your eye it's all gone away
... please give me one more stay, I guess that's why I feel I'm loosing again...

Miles we've walked the moons we've seen
Leave it all behind and start a new beginning.
I won't keep you searching when there's nothing left to find

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'cause I'm not ready for this life... ready for this life
But I'm ready for tonight, I'm still wondering why
... days convincing me once we'd never be strong, this is goodbye...

Tears fall down like the mourning rain
A taste of strain does
Something's getting compromised
Fall in or fallen the damage is done
And there's no convincing with these words you've spoken

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Pretty words roll off of your tongue
Come out of your mouth heard by everyone
So convincing I believed it for so long
Still I can't figure out when you were wrong
... everything you ever said would ever make this right or guilty
Now you say you wonder why you're my best ex-friend...

Pretty words roll off of your tongue
Come out of your mouth heard by everyone
So convincing I believed it for so long
Still I can't figure out why
... everything you ever said would ever make this right or guilty
Now you say you wonder why you're my best ex-friend...

<i>[Chorus]</i>

'cause I'm not ready for this life
But I'm ready for tonight, I'm still wondering why
... days convincing me once we'd never be strong, this is goodbye...
Days convince...
