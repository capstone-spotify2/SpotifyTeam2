Oh Mario, sit here by the window
Stay here 'til we reach Idaho
And when we go
Hold my hand on take-off
Tell me what I already know
That we can't talk about it
No, we can't talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's Bell
History shows
There's not a chance in hell, but

Oh Mario. we're only to Ohio
It's kinda getting harder to breathe
I won't let it show
I'm all about denial
But can't denial let me believe?
That we could talk about it
But we can't talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's Bell
History shows but rarely shows it well
Well, well, well

Oh Mario, why if this is nothing
I'm finding it so hard to dismiss
If you're what I need,
Then only you can save me
So come on baby. give me the fix
And let's just talk about it
I've got to talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's Bell
History shows
Like it was show and tell
So tell me
That's how I nearly fell
By ringing Pavlov's Bell
So, baby, show and tell
Oh Mario, Mario
