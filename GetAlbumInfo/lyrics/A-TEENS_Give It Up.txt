A Teens are back to give the right type of feelings 
To make you dance to make your happiness grow 
We'll never stop the music we're never leaving 
Until you got it right and no one feels low 

Cuz what you need is what you get (yea yea yea) 
So let it loose

There's something you can do 
Put a smile on your face and that's how 
You're gonna make it 
Give it up give it up give it up now

To the left to the right spin around now

For you to move your body for us to give the groove (yea yea) 
Nothing can stop us now you don't have to worry
