What has happened down here
Is the winds have changed
Clouds roll in from the north
And it started to rain
It rained real hard, and
It rained for a real long time
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline

The river rose all day
The river rose all night
Some people got lost in the flood
Some people got away alright
The river had busted through
Clear down to Plaquemine
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline

Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away

President Coolidge come down
In a railroad train
With his little fat man
With a note pad in his hand
President says "little fat man
Oh isn't it a shame
What the river has done
To this poor farmer's land"

Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
You're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, oh Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Lord, they're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
