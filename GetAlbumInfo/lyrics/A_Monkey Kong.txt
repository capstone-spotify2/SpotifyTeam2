There's nothing real about your fight
There's nothing in the shit you write
You've got charisma in your hair
The make-up lady put in there.. and it's

One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong

Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong

You're the captain of the team
You're the new king of the scene
You hire a guy to keep you punk
Laugh it up 'cause you don't know you're sunk

And Its One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong

Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong

How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....

Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean

It don't matter what you say, it won't change it anyway
You're not what you want to be
Every minute that you waste, when you're taking on the place
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong
