His song comes on the radio, and brings back your memory*
And reminds me of the way that it used to be
You loved all his hits like "hello darlin" and "tight fittin' jeans"
I just wish your leaving were "only make believe"

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
And how we used to sing along to all the ones that we knew 
It's not that they aren't good I used to love them to
But every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you

He may have been the best friend that any song ever had
But when I hear that growl in his voice it always makes me sad
It hurts to hear him sing "I'm not through loving you yet"
Lord only knows what I'd give if I could forget

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Daddy left us when I was only three
All he left behind were those Conway Twitty records and me

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Momma every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
