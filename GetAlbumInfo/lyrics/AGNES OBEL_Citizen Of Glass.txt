Rend a black drop from my heart
With the weight of days
The end of time has just begun
I hear it call your name

And no straining of the string
Can reverse what will begin

Some let go and some hold on
There is no mistake
If I could wash all ill away
Tell me would you stay?

And no lovers sin
Can reverse what will begin
