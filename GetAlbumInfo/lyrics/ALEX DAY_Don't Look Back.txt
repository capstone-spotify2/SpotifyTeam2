This won't be the first time that I'll give it all I've got
I promise I don't mean for everything to turn out wrong
I'm not a complex person, wind me up and watch me go
You'll always be second to my love for the unknown

It's late and your nose is turning red from the cold
Our feet are walking rhythmically and crumpling the snow
And I have got myself a question that I would like to ask
When it gets to midnight, will you take my freezing hands and dance?

And it's too late for me, but you can still be free if you leave now
And don't look back, my love

I'm a sucker for stability, which might come as a surprise
But I can't help but love the way you smile to one side
We don't need the music to remind us what we've lost
I can barely move my fingers and I'm slipping on the frost

Now the dark is all around us but for the full moon in the sky
The world is silent to me, we're the only ones alive
And I can see my breath in front of me, dancing in the air with yours
We both know what we want, but we can't cos we're so unsure

And it's too late for me, but you can still be free if you leave now
And don't look back, my love
