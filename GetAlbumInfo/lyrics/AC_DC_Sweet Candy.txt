Here she come yeah
Doing that thing yeah
Make the boys go wild
Yeah sweet child

She do a dance
Slides down a pole
She turn a backflip
Make your heart roll

Caught in a spotlight
Crawls across the floor
Calls for attention
The boys yell out for more
Sweet Candy

Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
All night Candy

She splits the nights
Selling us her charms
She glide around the pole
All night long

She really rolls the dice
Panting in wait, yeah
She knows just what she done
And she gives it all and shakes
Sweet Candy

Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
I say all night Candy

There she goes
Oh yeah

Clap and kneel

Clap and kneel
Sweet Candy
Clap and kneel
I say all night Candy

Sweet, sweet Candy
Sweet, sweet Candy
