Oh, did I strike the chord of 
Honest in you?
Did I strike it hard enough
A bout of lust between true love
My heart it cries, with every lie
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you?

In the wane of my submission
I dreaded everything
What lucky fate lies waiting
For this troubadour of mercy, tell me

Oh, did I strike the chord of 
Honesty in you?
Did I strike it hard enough
A bout of lust between true love
My heart it cries, with every lie
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you?

Did I baby?

Did cupid pluck my strings with fingers
Strumming through my heart like thunder
Maybe if you knew...

I'd bet you'd write this song for me
Oh! Would you strike it gently?
Oh! Would you strike it mightly?
My heart it cries, with every lie
Did I strike the key of honesty in you?

Is this life or a test of endurance?
I'm durable but, am I able, am I wanting?
Do I need to strike this chord in you?
Do I need to see the truth?

Oh, did I strike the chord of 
Honest y in you?
Did I strike it hard enough
A bout of lust between true love
My heart it cries, with every lie
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you?

Oh, did I strike the chord of 
Honesty in you?
Did I strike it hard enough
A bout of lust between true love
My heart it cries, with every lie
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you?
