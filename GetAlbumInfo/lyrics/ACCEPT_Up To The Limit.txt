Too many things happened today
Too many words I don't wanna say
I wanna be cool but the heat's coming up
I'm ready to kill 'cause enough is enough

All I can say - out of my way
Before I get to the top
All I can feel is wild running blood
Please stop - you better watch it

It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit
It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit

Do me a favour and leave me alone
The most I love you is when you're gone
Please, disappear and don't come back
I'm not the kind of guy you can check

All I can say - out of my way
Before I get to the top
All I can feel is wild running blood
Please stop - you better watch it

It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit
It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit

To the limit - up to the limit
To the limit - up to the limit

It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit
It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit

Up to the limit

It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit
It's getting up to the limit
Up to the limit

To the limit - up to the limit
To the limit - up to the limit
