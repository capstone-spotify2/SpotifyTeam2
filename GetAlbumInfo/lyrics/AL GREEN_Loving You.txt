What a beautiful morning
A happy morning, morning, you see
Where the Lord has blessed each one
Each one, even you and me
I thank the Lord for his goodness
For he's been my friend
I thank the Lord for the children
Now we can walk on in

Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Loving you
Keep on loving you

On more thing...

What a beautiful day
The Lord has whispered something in my ear
Well, it's nothing sad
But it's something never ever brings a tear
I thank the Lord for my time
He gave unto my friend
Now I think it's time that we get together
And walk on in

I'm trying to be good like my Jesus
See, I'm trying to be good like my Jesus
Trying to be good like my Jesus
Loving you
I can't stop loving you

Trying to get to Heaven that way
See, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Trying to get to Heaven that way
Loving you
I'm gonna keep on loving you

See, I cried when I wouldn't
I wouldn't take nothing for the man
There are other times when I don't
I don't really think I can

(Trying to get to Heaven that way)
But He's been so good
(Trying to get to Heaven that way)
But He's been so good
Loving you
Keep on loving
Let me keep loving
Keep on loving
Keep on giving
Keep on singing
Keep loving you
I won't stop
Even got me feeling like...
Loving you
I can't stop loving you
Let me keep loving you
Keep on loving
Loving you
