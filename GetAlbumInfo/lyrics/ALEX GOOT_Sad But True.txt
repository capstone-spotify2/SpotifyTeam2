I never thought that Iâd see the world like this
Youâre the one thing that I thought Iâd never miss
So tell me princess just where you plan to go
And when you get there please leave me alone

Cause I have never been this lost or betrayed or forgotten
I can not see where I went wrong
So be yourself and donât hold back because
Everybodyâs helping you achieve your goal

I woke up late this cold dark afternoon
Somehow felt that Iâd be losing you
I never understood where I went wrong
Somehow in my head I know Iâm right

Cause I have never been this lost or betrayed or forgotten
I can not see where I went wrong
So be yourself and donât hold back because
Everybodyâs helping you achieve your goal

Oh the way that youâve found somebody else
Seasons change it sounds cliche but what the hell
He will never love you like I did
Itâs over now
Your replaceable
I hope you know
<i>[never love you like I did
Itâs over now
Your replaceable
I hope you know <i>[x3]</i>

Cause I have never been this lost or betrayed or forgotten
I can not see where I went wrong
So be yourself and donât hold back because
Everybodyâs helping you achieve your goal

Yeah you achieved your goal <i>[x2]</i>
