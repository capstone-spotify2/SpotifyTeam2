You are like the ocean
And you're drowning me
The sunrise casting shadow
As far as I can see
'Cause you're so bitter sweet

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm in love, I'm in love
And I hate it
I'm in love and so overrated
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you

I'm in love, I'm in love, I can take it
I'm in love and feel so naked
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you

I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it
I hate it

Sometimes I feel spineless
I can't stand up straight
And sometimes I'm so stupid
I make the same mistake
But I can walk away

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It's the agony, It's the extasy
And it's stolen me, And it's killin' me
And it's killin' me

I'm in love, I'm in love

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I'm in love And I hate it
Hate it
