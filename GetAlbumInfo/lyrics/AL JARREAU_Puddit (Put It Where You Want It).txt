Puddit it in your pocket
Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

Corner of your office
Floor boards of your car
BB King sure keeps 'em
In that blues guitar

No matter where you go
Whatever game you playin'
Never leave home without some
Put some in everyday

To keep it in your laughter
Twinkle in your eye
Up in all your rafters
Underneath your tie

Puddit in your chapel
Underneath the pew
All your kids in chapter
Skipin' back to school

No matter where you go
Whatever game you playin'
Don't you leave home without some
Puddit in everyday

When the people start to roar
We, come back for more

Puddit it in your pocket
Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

One more last suggestion
Teach 'em every move
When they pop the question
Tell 'em it's the groove
