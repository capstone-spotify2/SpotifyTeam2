Drowned in flames is where I can be found, 
my nose broke from being smashed into the ground. 
What a waste, this place I call my home. 
Escape this place and break out on my own! I'm still reaching. 
Try to slap me down, but I'll still
hold. In the fray is where I can be found. 
My head is bruised from always being knocked around. 
What a fight, this life I call my own! 
Escape this life, and break out on my own! I'm still reaching! 
Try to slap me down, but I'll still hold. 
I'll hold my own.
