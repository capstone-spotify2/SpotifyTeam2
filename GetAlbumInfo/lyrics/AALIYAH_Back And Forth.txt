Let me see you go back
Let me see you go forth

It's Friday
and I'm ready to sing pick up my girls
And hit the party scene
Tonight oh oh it's alright umm
So get up and let this funky mellow grove get
You in the mood cause you
Know it's alright
(back round - so Mr. DJ keep the music grooving)
Don't stop moving
Let me see you, let me see you go

Back, back forth and forth <i>[x4]</i>
(see you go back and forth)

Now it's time for you
To make your move to the dance floor
So throw your hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care
Ya oh it's the liyah
Living up to the stage I got jazz personality,
G mentality peace to soul train
So if the DJ keep on moving
Don't stop moving know let me hear you go
Back and forth

<i>[Chores x4:]</i>

<i>[R. Kelly:]</i>

<i>[Aaliyah:]</i>

<i>[Chorus till fade]</i>
