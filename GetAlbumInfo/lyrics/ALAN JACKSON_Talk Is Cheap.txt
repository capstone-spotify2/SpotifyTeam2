Talk about life, talk about death
Talk about catching every breath
Talk about when, and talk about why!
Talk about do, and talk about donât
Talk about will and talk about wonât
Talk about the sweet <i>[?]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!

Talk about right, and talk about wrong
Talk about trying to get along
Talk about the way it all would be.
Talk about now, and talk about then
Talk about everywhere youâve been
Talk about being free.

<i>[Chorus: (x2)]</i>
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!
