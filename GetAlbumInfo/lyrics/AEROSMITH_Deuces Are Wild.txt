I love to look into your big brown eyes 
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize 
They say the things nobody dares to say 
And I'm not about to let you fly away 

My lover with no jet lag 
We're staying up all night in my sleeping bag 
You got a heart beatin' rhythm from the subterranean 
I really love you little girl 
I don't need to explain 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl 
Like a double shot of love is so fine 
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl 
'Cause you and me is two of a kind 

Ah, like deja vu I feel like I've been here 
Or somewhere else but you've been always near 
It's you that's in my dreams I'm begging for 
But I woke up when someone slammed the door 

So hard I fell outta bed 
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread 
And the moral of the story I can testify 
I get stoned on you girl 
That's the best reason why 

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
