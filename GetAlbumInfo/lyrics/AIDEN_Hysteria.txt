Love how they burn your synagogues
Love how they torch your holy books
Filling coffers with your grief
Filling coffins with your misery
Faith holding outright criminals safe
This is just the world we live in
Can you justify the pain
The death of fiction will save us all

Hysteria
We live We die
I wont give up
In a world worth saving goodbye
I don't have anything to fear
I live, I live hysteria

Wait supporting outright genocide
Hate let us all disseminate
A message to your herd
Our voices will be heard
Now faith is a question you can choose
Faith whether Christian, Muslim, Jew
Still you all distort the truth
The death of fiction will save us all

Searching for the answers are
you asking all the questions
Will the evidence suffice your fear
Human evolution is the only real solution
All the truth you gotta hear
Would you stand and fight
