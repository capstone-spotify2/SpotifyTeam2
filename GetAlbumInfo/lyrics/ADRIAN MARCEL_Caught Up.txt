<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
My girl keep calling my phone
And I donât even wanna answer right now
If she knew what I was doing in this bed
She would have a heart attack right now
I met a chick up in DOA
Say she wanna live here with me
Hit the W a quarter past three
Showin' me sheâs a certified freak

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Itâs crazy how she worked that back
The way she worked that back
Hey pretty, oh shorty, put it on me like that
I be like wait, hollup, still ain't catch your name
She moving up from another city

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Iâm your temptation, give you sensations
Nobody has to know
Girl I swear you got a nigga caught up, up, up, up
You gon' fuck around and get me caught up, up, up, up, up, up
Even though I got a girl at the crib
When I see you I just wanna get it in
Girl, you got me caught up, up, up, up, up, up

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
See we been at it for a week by now
Matter of fact we in the sheets right now
It's too late for me to turn back
âCause Iâm in too deep right now
She got me creeping all late at night
How can something so wrong feel right?
Booty soft, but her bodyâs so tight
She let me kiss it anywhere I like

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Phone:]</i>
Hello?
Wassup baby?
Not much, still at home right now
<i>[?]</i>
I love you

<i>[Chorus]</i>
