I believe we were meant for each other
And there will be no another in our story
I believe that some things last forever
And she is standing right here before me

I will never let you go
And I will never fail to prove my love to you
And there's something you should know

Do you mind if I adore you,
For as long as it will take
Do you mind if I adore you
Every moment I'm awake

I believe that our life is just beginning
Why my heart is always singing when I'm near you
And I believe that these vows so softly spoken
Are now the deepest ocean we can fall into

I will never let you go
And for evermore I will show my love is true
And there's something you should know

Do you mind if I adore you
For as long as it will take
Do you mind if I adore you
Every moment I'm awake
