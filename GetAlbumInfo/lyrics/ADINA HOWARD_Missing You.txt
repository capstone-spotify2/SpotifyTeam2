<i>[Verse 1]</i>
The rain falls
down on my window pane
the silenced whispers things you used to say
I close me eyes and I feel you near
how I wish you were here
holdin me close in your arms again my dear
whispering sweet nothings in my ear
the passion burns
on how I miss my baby

<i>[Chorus x1]</i>
Postcards and photographs
loveletters to you
late night phone calls to say
you love me too
oh how I miss you

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
The memories hanging on the walls of my mind
soothes my soul
Lord knows I want my baby back home 
don't wanna spend another minute without you
its been so long
the taste of our kiss fading
baby, stay on my mind
the way i feel for you holds
me close at night
but i'm still missing you

<i>[Chorus x1]</i>
Postcards, and photographs
love letters to you
late night phone calls to say
you love me too
oh how I miss you

<i>[Hook]</i>
I lie awake at night
wishing you were by my side

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
Postcards and photographs
love letters to you
late night phone calls to say
you love me too
oh how I miss you

Postcards and photographs
love letters to you
late night phone calls to say
you love me too
oh how I miss you
