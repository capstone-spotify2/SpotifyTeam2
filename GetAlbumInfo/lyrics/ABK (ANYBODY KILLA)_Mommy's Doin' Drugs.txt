Why these kids always smelling like a blunt
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
Two mismatched socks and hair fucked up, why
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
Never fed, always saying that they hungry
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
Now I guess I know what happened to that money
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doin drugs
This situation I canât take, now Iâm angry
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
I canât believe she would do this to the family
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
Dear mom, how you doin (how you doin)
(Iâm just writing) Iâm just writing to see if you alright

Always mad, taking it out on us
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
Turning into a person no one can trust
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
It ainât our fault that she acts this way, itâs just
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs
And if she donât get help, then I swear will run away because
Mommyâs doinâ drugs, mommyâs doinâ drugs

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

Itâs been about six weeks and moms seems straight
Hopefully itâs the last time sheâll have to rehabilitate
Actually it will be, for us that is cause
Iâm a court date away from being granted the kids
All I know that itâs time to make a change
Erase all the memories and wipe away the pain
Embrace my kids and give em nothing but love
And try to help them forget that they mom is on drugs

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

Hey mom whatâs up, you doing aright, we just came here to see if you alright, you know
They taking care of you up there, donât worry about it, we got everything takin care of at home
You just get your rest, alright
