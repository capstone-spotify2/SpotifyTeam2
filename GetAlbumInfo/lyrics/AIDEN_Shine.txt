Walk straight into the light
Strapped down in the ambulance
Keep falling out of life
Near death this time
Holding on a thread
Lysergic ignorance
Has my wife been notified
Oh dear your husbands dead

Hold my hand believe
My hell is burning bright
I feel it change
I know eternally you shine

Can you feel my heart beat
Pump harder find a pulse
Change veins with that IV
Please William breathe
All I see are autumn leaves
Rain down on the ambulance
Still strapped to the gurney I
Crash crash I want my life

Sign of the times
This ambulance ride
Offer up this life

Wake up, signs of life, hollow flesh
Wake up, signs of life, wake the dead
