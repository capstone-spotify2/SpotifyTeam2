Say it's all right, say it's all right
Say it's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, it's all right

We're gonna move it slow
When the lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more
And it's all right, it's all right

Now listen to the beat
You kinda pat your feet
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right

When you wake up early in the mornin'
Feelin' sad like so many of us do
Harm a little soul, make life your goal
And surely something gotta come to you

And say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, it's all right

Now everybody clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right

Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
And my woes got to go and my love she will know
From morning, noon and night

And she's gotta say that it's all right, say it's all right
Say it's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's alright, it's all right

Now come on and clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right

Now come on and clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right
