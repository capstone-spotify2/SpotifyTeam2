It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money, then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I made my baby cry

Tried hard to help me, and you put me at ease
Loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
I've gone and lost the best baby I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
