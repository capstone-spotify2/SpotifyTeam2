I've been praying everyday
Lord please make a way
Man I been through the pain
Now the people know my name

I did it when they said I couldn't
Got it when they said I wouldn't
Why would they say that I shouldn't?
You get the work that I put in

Some of y'all rapping like y'all still got something to prove
I got over that so you know
I don't like rappers who say they got next
When they've been in the game for 10 years or so
Impressed by the fact that you fake niggas famous
You keep finding ways with them favours
Frankly, I'm far from complaining
The faster you make it, the quicker you fall
Nigga face it, I'm finally buzzing
I was 15 rapping like I was 20 or something
By 2014 I had all of your favourites frustrated
Confused and afraid of the youngin
So allow me to formally reintroduce myself
Man I done changed, A-Reece the name
I'm getting bigger and better than how you thought I would remain
A whole other lane, with the same ass pace
I'm patient, no mistakes are made
I pray my haters age up to a 100
Just so they can witness me fuck up the game
Rearrange it again, again and again

This shit right here make Somizi go straight
This shit right here makes tomorrow today
Fuck up your plans, make your album delayed
What more can I say?
Ambitiouz done scooped a nigga at his lowest
Fam everybody sleeping, I'm finally woke
Fam man this time I really need to focus
I'm tryna be considered as a goal
Speak under oath like I already knew I'm the shit
For real, you got to admit I'm cold as a geys'
I'm colder than June 25th
For real, I just got a deal
Why you acting like daaiden's such a big deal?
Let's be honest, I'm a problem in this game
You rappers ain't the same, you changed the way you rap
Your beat selection is infact inspired by the boy
Congratulations, you're employed
I ain't depending on nobody here but myself
And if I put an album out I swear
It's gon be everywhere but the shelf

I guess when you broke you get bitter
Start throwing shade at the winners
But how can you blame me?
I've been eating peanut butter and jelly for dinner
I guess, I'm here just tryna get rich and then
Move outta my mama crib
I mean, I'm getting older and not any younger like Benjamin Button, you dig?
I guess people are quick to forget
They love you, they hate you and love you again, I know
And some of you niggas who get on your knees and pray that I never excel I guess you gon need a whole other prayer
Cause yes, I'm winning I'm doing so well
I just check out my mail and man it's a movie
We moving, I wish I could share, oh yeah
I done went silent and gave y'all a year to prepare
Sit back and just look at me run some shit
Don't worry cause down at the bottom I tell you there's plenty of company
