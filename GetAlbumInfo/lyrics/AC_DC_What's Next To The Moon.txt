Well I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Givin' that woman just one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' 'bout Casey Jones
Wide eyed woman half a mile ahead
Thinkin' 'bout broken bones
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love

Heavenly body flyin' across the sky
Superman was outta town
Come on honey gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent lookin' for a free ride
Thinkin' about Lois Lane
It's a bird it's a plane it's suicide
And that'd be a shame
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love
But what's next to the moon

Long arm lookin' for a finger print
Tryin' to find a mystery clue
Hittin' me with the third degree
Working on the thumb screw
All right officer I confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love guaranteed
Your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love
What's next to the moon
