Little bitty pretty one
Donât wanna talk with me.
Lovely, lovely, lovely one,
I set apart on my knees.

Tell you a story about a long time ago
Little bitty pretty one
I bet youâre watching me go.

Little bitty pretty one
Donât wanna talk with me.
Lovely, lovely, lovely one,
I set apart on my knees.
