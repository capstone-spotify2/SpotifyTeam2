Once there was a time
I thought that I
Never would be without you
Now I look around and find
I'm on my own
And I can't stop thinking about you

Hard to be on the bottom once you've been on the top
Had a good thing going, didn't want it to stop
Oh why, it's a lonely Christmas morning
Now I'm out in the rain, and I can't find the sun
My summer vacation has turned into fall
The shade of it all

Now I'm so far away (where'd you go, where'd you go)
Without a home (she's homeless)
Like a moon without a sun (where's the sun, where's the sun)
Looking for a friendly face
I see so many (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
But they only just remind me of one

Now I'm trying to swim while I'm watching you fly
I'm feeling so low so I try to stay high
To fight away all this hurting
And I try to look strong, but I'm feeling so weak
I try to act big but you know that I'm small
The shade of it all

Why's it gotta be like this
I can't be the only one on earth to feel like this
Look around and I see, I've got the strength inside me
And it's been there (it's been there)
Yeah it's been there (god, it's right there)
All along
All along

Now I've got a brighter day
It's not the end
No, it seems the story's just begun
We've gotta fight away the shade
Let's start today
And we all can shine on as one

So let's take all the hate, and replace it with love
Take a journey below so we can get up above
And the world can start rejoicing (halleloo)
You're a beacon of light, and you'll shine through the dark
We can light up the world, all it takes is a spark
That's all
We can light up the shade of it all

(Like the neverending story with a trail)
(So shady boots)
The shade of it all
(So shady, so shady, so shady shady shady house down boots)
(So shady, so shady, so shady house down boots)
(So shady, so shady, so shady boots)
We can light up the shade of it all
