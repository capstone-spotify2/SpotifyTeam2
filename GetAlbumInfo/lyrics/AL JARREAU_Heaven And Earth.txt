I've always believed in dreams
And that fantasies somehow come true
When dreaming of you
I've seen a moment's magic shine
Upon the darkest night
And fill it with light
I've heard the wind whisper melody
Of love meant to be
I've searched the heavens for you

I've searched heaven and earth
Chasing my dreams on the wings
Of everlasting love
I've searched through heaven and earth
Voicing the song my heart sings
Heaven help us find our love...love

I've wished on a thousand stars
Just for a sparkle to shine through
And lead me to you
Then you appeared as if by magic
Shined your love right into my life
Made everyday bright
So let the wind whisper melody
Of love meant to be
I've searched the heavens for you

I've searched heaven and earth
Chasing my dreams on the wings
Of everlasting love
I've searched through heaven and earth
Voicing the song my heart sings
Heaven help us we're in love
...Forever in love
...Forever we're in heaven
