Four sins past sainthood,
It's like I'm dying to forget
All the sleepless nights,
Lying perfectly alone and still.
I can drink 'till victory,
I'll drink to the mighty,
Drink until I die,
Or at least until the sunrise
When honesty,
As popular as a plague,
Comes to remind me
The dead's winning the race
With me going nowhere.
Right down the street,
A prostitute is selling
The closest thing to love
That this country has to offer,
And Alachua still sleeps tonight,
And Alachua still sleeps tonight,
And Alachua still sleeps tonight...

So we fought for the republic
While the Catholic sun filled every eye.
From the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,
We drank to the mighty.
We died for oil,
We died for borders,
Killed for democracy,
Still believed every platform.
Can you handle the death,
Accept what we create together?
I still know every politician
Is a fucking monster.
Culture kills bureaucrats
And all other undesireables.
History said we died for freedom,
But today no justice was served,
And America still sleeps tonight,
And America still sleeps tonight,
And America still sleeps tonight,
And I hope it doesn't wake up tomorrow.

So we boasted that we were champions,
Each country singing it's own praise.
Like a rock thrown into the ocean,
Humanity was rising to the top.
Two world wars later,
Countless "military interventions",
We erect monuments to history
And give apologies to the dead.
All that was fought for the living
Is quickly forgotten.
We don't remember the dates,
We don't remember the reasons.
We have no idea what's going on,
Building histories of western corporations.
It doesn't even turn my stomach
To see the pictures of atrocities anymore,
Going numb in the new order
Of the new century.
And Alachua still sleeps tonight,
And America still sleeps tonight,
And the world still sleeps tonight...

And Alachua still sleeps tonight...
And America still sleeps tonight...
And the world still sleeps tonight...
