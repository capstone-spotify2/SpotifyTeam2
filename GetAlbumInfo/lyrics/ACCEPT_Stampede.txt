Crossed bars out the door
Stubborn run out through the town
Crawl cross beyond control
This body's gonna take you down
Move over till you walk
Black boulder will spit you out
Spend with me till the morn'
I'll tell you what it's all about
Wretched time!

Cross bar, over head
Keep 'em through the air
No time, no escape, caught through the stare
Still wear the parachute, drag you in the depth
I'll plant you in the soil
And serve you just pedets
So loud! It's the end of the line
You breed your kind
But you wasted your breath

(Stampede!)
Trapped into the ground
(Stampede!)
Flattened by the sound
(Stampede!)
Burn you on the stove
(Stampede!)
And pulverize your grounds!

You're gone and disappeared through the bloody swerve
Jab you, round you down to a moshpit straight from hell
Neck you out the throne, rearrange your face
And when you bottom out, it's a long way down from grace
So loud!
It's the end of the line
You breath your?
But don't waste your breath!
You'll never win!

(Stampede!)
Trapped into the ground
(Stampede!)
Flattened by the sound
(Stampede!)
Burn you on the stove
(Stampede!)
And pulverize your grounds!
