I would have lied far you
i would have died for you
You cut the skin off my bones

I thought you'd steal for me
I thought you'd kill for me
Ain't gonna throw the first stone

I feel a growing anger
'Cause you turned your back on me

Lay it down on me - lay it down on me
Lay it down on me - lay it down on me

I'm gonna fight for you
I'm gonna kill for you
I'm the blade of your knife

I gave my heart to you
But lost my faith in you
Now you're the hate of my life

I feel a growing anger
'Cause you turned your back on me

Lay it down on me - lay it down on me
Lay it down on me - lay it down on me
