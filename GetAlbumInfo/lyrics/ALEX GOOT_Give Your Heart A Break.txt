The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are,
So close yet so far.
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize,
Baby, I'm not like the rest?

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Yeah, yeah, yeah

On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply

The world is ours. If we want it,
We can take it if you just take my hand.
There's no turning back now.
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
