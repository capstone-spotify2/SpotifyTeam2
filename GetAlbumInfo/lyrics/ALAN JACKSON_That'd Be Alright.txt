If money grew on hackberry trees
If time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
That'd be alright

If I could keep the wind in my sails 
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
That'd be alright

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Yeah, That'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody everywhere
had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie 
We'd be livin' us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright

Go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad 
Turn all that negative down just a tad
That'd be alright

If my dear ol' dog never got old 
If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told 
That'd be alright

<i>[Chorus x3]</i>

That'd be alright
That'd be alright
Yeah, That'd be alright
That'd be alright....
That'd be alright
