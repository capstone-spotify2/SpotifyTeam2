You said marriage has a nice ring to it
and my jaw dropped down like the kickdrum knew it
I can't stop and let you go
Baby, I gotta mind to let you know
I'm not one to take it fast
I go the best seat back in history class
One lass chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel

Sayin' You
You make me feel so brand new
What can I do?

Let's toast the one's who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we've got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Now we're livin on love

We'll be found in Frankie's town
And tell the world we're gonna shake the ground
One last chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel

Sayin' You
You make me feel so brand new (oh oh oh)
What can I do?

Let's toast the one's who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we've got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Now we're livin on love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Now we're livin on love

Hey! You're the one I wait for
Wait each and every day for
You (You!)
You (You!)
Baby
Laugh, rhythm all around us
Sweet love, it finally found us
You
Baby girl
