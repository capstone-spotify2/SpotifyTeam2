You think you know all about me
'cause you spent the night,ha,
Yeah right,not quite
You think you're the one to tame me
I'm your mothers worse nightmere
An out of control freak
Just wait and see

I'm bad for you,I'll hurt your pride
I'll put a whole in your heart ten foot wide
I make you feel like you wanna die
Even I'd run from me if I could
I'm bad for you
And that's good

I'm a killer with a conscience
So I'm warning you watch what you do
Think before you try my patience
I'm an emotional time bomb
A virtual melt down
Yes it's true

I'm bad for you I'll hurt your pride
I'll put a whole in your heart ten foot wide
I make you feel like you wanna die
Even I'd run from me if I could
I'm bad for you, I'm bad for you
And that's good

You know I got a good side too
And I could do some good for you
But I'm bad for you I'll skin your hide
What your left with you wont recognise
If you run away now you'd be wise
Even I'd run from me if I could

I'm bad for you I'll hurt your pride
I'll put a whole in your heart ten foot wide
I make you feel like you wanna die
Even I'd run from me if I could
Im bad for you, I'm bad for you,
I'm bad for you, I'm bad for you
And thats good
