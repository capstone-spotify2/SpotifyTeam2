We've chased the misprinted lies
We've faced the path of time
And yet I fight
And yet I fight 
This battle all alone

No one to catch you
No place to call home

My gift to self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find
And yet I find
Repeating in my head
If I can't be my own 
i'd feel better dead
