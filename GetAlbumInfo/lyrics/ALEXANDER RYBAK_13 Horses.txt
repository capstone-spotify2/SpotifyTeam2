13 horses swimming in the sea
Waiting for someone to find them
Their ship is gone
and now they are alone
With water everywhere around them
The men were saved
from the sinking ship
Right before it started to burn
And while they're safe
their loyal friends need help
Patiently waiting for their turn

13 horses swimming in the sea
They don't even know it's pointless
Their pride remains
but this time it won't help
They used to be so tall
and suddenly they're small
There's a couple waiting far behind
Soon they will be out of sight
But then who cares -
they're dying anyway
All of them are doomed this night

11 horses swimming in the sea
The sea they thought was just a river
They're used to this
it's probably just a race
That helps to ease their minds
but where's the finish line
The night grows dark
the body wants to rest
It hurts to breathe
and still they do their best
They want to live
no matter for how long
Their thoughts all disappeared
'Cause now they're really scared

7 horses struggling in the sea
Waiting for someone to find them
They don't look back
'cause what's the point of that
There is only death behind them
They cry for help
but help will never come
They don't know where to swim
or what they're swimming from
They try to swim some more
when panic starts to spread
They're swimming in to shore
but only in their heads

The 3 last horses
Dying in the sea
Shouting out their cries for no one
They're born to win
they're screaming in their hearts
The strength of thousand men
They're fighting to the end

The sun is out
Birds are everywhere
They're flying high
surfing in the air
It's nice to live
when life is such a blast
One horse still swims
it seems to be the last

The thirteenth horse
has always been the best
His owner will be proud
But now he wants to rest
He's longing for his home
The girl will give him food
"Good boy" - she'll say
together they will play

13 horses swimming in the sea
Soon they will be gone forever
And while they swim,
One thing still remains
And that's the hope that never dies
It never dies
It never dies
