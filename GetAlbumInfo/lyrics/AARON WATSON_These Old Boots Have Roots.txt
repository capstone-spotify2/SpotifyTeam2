Yeah these old boots have roots
Just like my last name, I swear I will never bring it shame
Yeah these old boots have roots
When the winds are bitter cold, I know this love of ours will hold
Yeah these old boots have roots

So I march to the beat of my heart pounding like a drum
Let 'em run me down, but I'll stand my ground
No I won't forsake or forget where I come from
I swear I'll never break your heart, only wanna make you smile
These old boots want nothing more than to walk you down the aisle
These old boots have roots

Yeah these old boots have roots
They told the mark to walk the line, girl only you can make them shine
Yeah these old boots have roots
They're tested, tried and true, walking side by side by you
Yeah these old boots have roots

So I march to the beat of my heart pounding like a drum
Let 'em run me down, but I'll stand my ground
No I won't forsake or forget where I come from
I swear I'll never break your heart, only wanna make you smile
These old boots want nothing more than to walk you down the aisle
These old boots have roots

Yeah these old boots have roots
They haul a heavy load, down a long and winding road
Yeah these old boots have roots
Strong as a live oak tree, someday you can bury me in
These old boots

So I march to the beat of my heart pounding like a drum
Let 'em run me down, but I'll stand my ground
No I won't forsake or forget where I come from
I swear I'll never break your heart, only wanna make you smile
These old boots want nothing more than to walk you down the aisle
I'll never bend for a dream, God knows I'll never trade them in
For some shallow hearted soul bouncing back and forth again
Yeah these old boots have roots

Yeah these old boots have roots
Baby these old boots have roots
