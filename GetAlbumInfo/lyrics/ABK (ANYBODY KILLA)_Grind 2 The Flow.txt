Yo, Iâma a little hipper than the average hop
Iâm the type of motherfucker you canât stop
Especially those that make me mad
Cause I can be the worse enemy that you ever had
So if you knew me then, then you know me now
And for all the virgin ears, Iâm so glad to bust you out
I be all in your face but hard to find
Underground living so this killer can hustle and grind

<i>[Chorus]</i>
The life that you live, is it real or are you fakin?
Those rules you make, are they from your heart or were you persuaded ?
So Iâma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow
So Iâma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow

You know, every time I spit it people get it because we connected
And every time we get together we wreck shit
I pay dues to make moves just like the next man
Soul of a warrior, come and catch me if you can
Some of yaâll recognize real shit
While other are influenced and just take it like a bitch
So if you real with the words that you spill
There ainât no reason you should feel anything you do is ill

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I got some courage in the heavy hitting heart beat
I got the attitude to survive in the streets
I got the wisdom of an old school cat
With my mind set on one thing, taken it back
I got the nerve to go do whatever
Cause there really ainât too many out here doing it better
So when you see me keep one thing in mind
That this motherfucking killer is always on his grind

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
