Right back at you, record three
Makes you wish that you were me
'Cos we got no job for life
Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright
No two days turn out the same
Only sleeping on the plane
Not exactly Monkey days
C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 

Banshee wailing from my throat
Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills
From L.A. to Skillmans Hill
We've done time for stealing shows
There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go! 

C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 

Hot, like the desert sky
You're so cool on the inside
You hate being recognised
Going off on outside 

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 

Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
OAP's get in for free
Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door 

Come on, rock it up, to the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on!
