My bones are trembling
Veins are filled with ice
I see you swagger through
Your boots are shiny, too

I still feel your torture
Messing up my life
I cannot forget
How you showed me your despise

Deep down in the gravel
I lie and wait for relieve
And I hear the orders you scream
Sounds like a choir to me

Stand tight - all right
And assume the position - we all stand together
Stand tight - all right
And assume the position - we all stand together

I know I am unconscious
Just what you like to see
You say you've got to drill me
And you let me kiss your gun

I have to clean your boots
In every way you like
You deny my human rights
You don't make it easy

And I am so down
So devoted and humbled to you
What more can a slave remain
Before he floods away

Stand tight - all right
And assume the position - we all stand together
Stand tight - all right
And assume the position - we all stand together

Stand tight - all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
