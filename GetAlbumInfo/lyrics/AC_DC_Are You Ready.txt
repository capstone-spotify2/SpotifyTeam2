Sweet apple pie
Standing in the street
Hands outta line
Looking for some meat
She'll take you high when you feel her sting
She'll make you fly
Then you know you're comin'
Who all need it, who
Who all need it, you
Who all need it who all need it
You all breathe it
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time

She's making eyes
At everything she meet
It ain't it a crime
When she make you pump heat
She'll make you fly because that's her thing
She'll make you dry
Then you know you're broken in
Who all need it, you
Who all need it, yes you do
You all breathe it
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time

Who all need it
Who all need it
Who all need it, who all need it
You all breathe it, we all breathe it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Are you ready for a good time, are you ready
Are you ready for a good time, I wanna good time
Are you ready for a good time, are you ready
Are you ready for a good time, good good good good time
Are you ready for a good time, are you ready ready ready

Are you ready for a good time
