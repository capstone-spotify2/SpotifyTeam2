Oh, I wanna be with you
Oh, I know you want me too

So can I get a toot toot for the lovers tonight
Don't you love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?

Oh, you got me in your palms
But I want, want you in my arms

So can I get a toot toot for the lovers tonight
Don't you love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?

You got my mind, girl, spinning 'round and 'round
You got it spinning
So far away, girl, where it can't be found
Just go and admit

Toot toot for the lovers tonight
Don't you love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?
