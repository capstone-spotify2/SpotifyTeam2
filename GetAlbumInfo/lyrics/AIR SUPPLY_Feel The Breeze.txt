Since I met you how can I notice if the sky is blue or grey
But here I am standing outside looking into a cloudy day
This must be the time for reflection, my direction is not quite clear,
Now I feel the air is colder now I feel that winter's here.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Feel the breeze, we're coming to winter <i>[2x]</i>

I feel the breeze I feel dejected I feel a part of a love that's gone
For in this world to take some chances from your glances I see it's wrong
Winter's here and it's a long one to be alone and in the cold
Brother sun you cast a shadow, now I need my lonely role.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
