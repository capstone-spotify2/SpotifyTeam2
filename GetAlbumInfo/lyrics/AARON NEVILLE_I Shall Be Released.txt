They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man, oh, must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Someplace so high above this wall 

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Now, yonder stands a man, oh, in this lonely crowd
He's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long, I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Oh, any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
