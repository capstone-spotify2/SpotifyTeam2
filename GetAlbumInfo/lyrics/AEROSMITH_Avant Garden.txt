I had a friend who spoke of fate &amp; he
knew of another place in space in time
he told of how me &amp; my lady could look but we would never find said if you please I beg your pardon
sometimes the things you see they just aint so
you life can be an avant garden
cause loves what makes your garden grow

the sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you &amp; I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
we wont be denied here inside our Avant Garden

Sometimes my life aint what it seeming
Right from the start its what your hearts believing
could all this just be lucid dreaming
but dreams aint just enough for me

the sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you &amp; I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
we wont be denied here inside our Avant Garden

you know its just aint right
to deal with other shite
no one should ever be so broken hearted
dont ever be afraid cause when you got it made
yeah you dont even have to try

so i'll be waiting in your garden
watching all your flowers grow

the sun leads the way the moon lights the sky
I see you &amp; I lying in my Avant Garden
I dream of the day when our worlds collide
you'll know we've arrived here inside our Avant Garden

the sun brings the rain the moon needs the sky
i see you &amp; I lying in my Avant Garden
beware of the lies a word to the wise
there's sweet cherry pies
and truth inside our Avant Garden
