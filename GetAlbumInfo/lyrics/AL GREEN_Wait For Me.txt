Darling did you know that I, I dream about you
Waiting for the look in your eyes, when we meet for the first time
Darling did you know that I, I pray about you
praying that you will hold on, and keep your loving eyes only for me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
'Cause I am waiting for, praying for you darling
Wait for me to, wait for me as I wait for you <i>[2x]</i>

Darling did you know that I dream about life together,
knowing you will be forever I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And darling when I say, "'Til death do us part", I'll mean it with all of my heart,
Now and always faithful to you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Now I know you may have made mistakes, but there's forgiveness
and a second chance, So wait for me, darling wait for me, wait for me, wait for me

<i>[Chorus]</i>
