Oh, tonight is excitement
Ultraviolet, feel the beat of my heart
So flirtatious, I'm anxious
Show me baby, work me like I'm your job

Put your body on my body, put your hand in mine
When you're ready, say you're ready
You can get it tonight
Everybody in the party wanna do it now
Hey now, hey now!
Let's play!

Oh, follow the leader
Sexy, sexy, bam-ballerina
Oh, balans, can you?
Oh, balans, baby
Oh, work for me harder
Oh, sexy sexy, dirty La bamba
Oh, balans, can you?
Oh, balans

Take me higher, your highness
Don't be shy, just give me, give me good love
Baby, light the fire, uuh, explosive
And you know it, every time that we touch

Put your body on my body, put your hand in mine
When you're ready, say you're ready
You can get it tonight
Everybody in the party wanna do it now
Hey now, hey now!
