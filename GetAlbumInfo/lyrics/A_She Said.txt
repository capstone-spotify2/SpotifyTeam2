Instead

Monday, Tuesday, act your age

None of her friends would believe her

Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

Monday, Tuesday, it's the same
Wednesday, Thursday, act your age
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
