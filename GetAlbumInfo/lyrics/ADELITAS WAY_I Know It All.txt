Walk into the room with your head high
Never listen âcause your busy giving bad advice
You try to tell me how I should do my thing
You say you know how it goes âcause your big time
Whatâs going on in your mind in the meantime?
Insecure but sure of everything

Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all
Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all

Every time that you talk itâs a big show
Never heard you say the words I donât know
Youâll feed your ego anything
Why donât you tell me what to name my first kid?
Show me how to blow my money like you did
You can even tell me what song to sing

Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all
Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all

I donât know what do you want?
You donât know who I am
I donât know what do you want?

Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all
Hey there youâre a know it all a one upper, a motherfucker
Hey there youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all, youâre a know it all
