We sat down together
Our table for two
We went through the menu so slowly
I just couldn't take my eyes off you.
The juices were flowing
But time wouldn't move
We gazed and the waiters were waiting
They came and went away
Everything around me disappeared.

Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
I tell you I've made up my mind
There'll be no excuses this time
I want you (oh baby)
I need you (baby baby)
I want you, don't let me go
Slipping through your fingers again.

We left in a dream
And ran through the night
Our bodies were frozen in your doorway
But I wanted to kiss you in the moonlight.
We lay in the darkness
Our fingers in knots
There was so much love in your touches
As you wiped my tears away
I was crying softly to you.

Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
I tell you I've made up my mind
There'll be no excuses this time
I want you (oh baby)
I need you (baby baby)
I want you, don't let me go
Slipping through your fingers again.

Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
I tell you I've made up my mind
There'll be no excuses this time
I want you (oh baby)
I need you (baby baby)
I want you, don't let me go
Slipping through your fingers again.

Don't you worry no more
I won't be leaving you (now I believe in you)
Don't you worry no more....
