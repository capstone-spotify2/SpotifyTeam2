I had a good job and a good lovin' woman 
But the world fell apart and then I lost them 
Now I can't pay the loans or the overdue fines 
Can't drink enough whiskey to make it alright 

But the tide will turn 
Cause I have learned 

There ain't no way but the hard way get used to it 
I said there ain't no way but the hard way 
so get used to it 

You say I drink too much and that it's a problem 
But that's how it goes when you hit rock bottom 
Don't need your advice or your helping hand 
Cause I'm living on the road in a rock'n'roll band 

The time will turn 
And you will learn 

There ain't no way but the hard way get used to it 
I said there ain't no way but the hard way 
So get used to it 

The tide will turn yes it will 
I'm gonna roll on 
I'm gonna stand strong 
For the long haul 
Its rock'n'roll 

When the chips are down 
You gotta make your play 

Cause there ain't no way 
But the hard way 
There ain't no way 
But the hard way 
I said there ain't no way 
But the hard way 
Oh no there ain't no way 
But the hard way 

There ain't no way but the hard way Get used to it 
I said there ain't no way but the hard way 
So get used to it 
There ain't no way but the hard way 
No way but the hard way 
No way but the hard way so get used to it 
The tide will turn
