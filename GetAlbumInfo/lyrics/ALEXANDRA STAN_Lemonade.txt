Everything is so good in the summer air
Just put behind you all the problems that we share
Look into the sun, you'll see me and you
Cause now you have the perfect view

I'm so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
You're the only one for me
I'm so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade
Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

I kept my promise and we're lying on the beach
Now we have each other and it feels so rich
Look into the sun, you'll see me and you
Cause now you have the perfect view

I'm so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
You're the only one for me
I'm so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade
Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

So alone
You're the only one for me
I'm so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade
Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm thinking you're on holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

Sunny, no money, holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade
Sunny, no money, holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade
