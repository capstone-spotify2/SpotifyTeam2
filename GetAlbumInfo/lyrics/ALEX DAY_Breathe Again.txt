I don't have the answers
I don't even know what questions I should ask
Maybe I'd go back and do things differently
If I could change the past

But I am not ashamed of my mistakes
Because they made me who I am
I am strange and I am flawed
And I am doing everything I can

And I will run outside
Into the cold dark night
And in the dawning light
I will breathe again

I get kinda nervous
When I think about the things I face each day
Maybe I'm a fool for stepping up
When I know what could come my way

But life is not a game it is a war
And its a war I plan to win
I've not gotten anywhere
Daydreaming giving up or giving in

And I will run outside
Into the cold dark night
And in the dawning light
I will breathe again

Whats the point of being on this earth
If we don't ever take a chance
Why do we ignore the things we want
Why don't we listen to our hearts

Now I am here I'm wide awake
And I will turn each moment inside out
I will breathe life into me
And tangle my self in a tear and now <i>[?]</i>

And I will run outside
Into the cold dark night
And in the dawning light
I will breathe again
And in the dawning light
I will breathe again
And in the dawning light
I will breathe again
