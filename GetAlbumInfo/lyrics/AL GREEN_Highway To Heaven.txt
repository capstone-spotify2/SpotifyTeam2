Well, the first time ever I saw you
You were sleeping as the night fell, fell upon us
My soul felt something like a mighty wind
Voice like muddy waters
Surprise attack on my heart
Oh, it freed my soul, oh, it made me whole

Well, it's a high, long way to Heaven
Well, nothing can go up there, but the pure-hearted
They say it's a highway to Heaven
Nothing can go up there, but the pure-hearted

First time ever I saw you
You were sleeping as the night fell, fell upon us
My soul felt something like a mighty wind
Voice like Muddy Waters
Surprise attack on the heart
