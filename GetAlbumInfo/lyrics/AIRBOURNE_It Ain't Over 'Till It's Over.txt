Sweatin' out upon the stage 
Thankful to be out of the cage 
Got no fear coz I dont feel pain 
Come on baby let's do it again 

It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
Gonna ride this train till the end of line 
Love this bitch till the morning light 

Drinkin' all the beer that I can find 
C'mon baby won't you be mine 
No slowing down got no stop signs 
Hit the gas honey its rockin' time 

It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
Gonna ride this train till the end of line 
Love this bitch till the morning light 

It ain't over over no it ain't it's rock'n'roll 
Over over not for me 
It ain't over over no it ain't cause it's rock'n'roll 
Until the fat lady fat lady fat lady screams rock'n'roll 

It ain't over until it's over
