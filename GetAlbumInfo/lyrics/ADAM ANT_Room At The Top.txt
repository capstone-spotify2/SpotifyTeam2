Once is never enough
Never is never was
Here and now is all that counts
Here and now in large amounts
Be beautiful but shut up
The going can be real tough

You can keep your fancy bars
Clubby friends and fast cars
And when the going gets hard
You can eat your credit cards
I really tried to fight it
But what the hell I like it

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty-first century head

Room at the top - so eighteenth century
Room at the top - so eighteenth century
Room at the top
There's always room

If some of this fits you
Or like the things that you might do
It's the pleasure and the pain
That makes us do it all again
They say
Be beautiful and shut up
The going can be real tough
