I ain't got a heart of stone
I'm hurtin' more than I've ever kown
If you mean the things you said
I'm gonna wind up outa my head
Can't sleep alone at night
I just can't seem to get it right
Damned if I do
I'm damned if I don't but love you

I don't wanna tie you down
Don't need a reason to have you around
But each time you walk away
Don't be surprised if I ask you to stay
Can't sleep alone at night
I just can't seem to get it right
Damned if I do
I'm damned if I don't but love you
I said I'm damned if I do
I'm damned if I don't cause love you

I ain't got a heart of stone
You haven't left me a mind of my own
But it's such a hold on me
I don't think I could ever be free
How can I survive
I'm fighting to keep myself alive
I'm damned if I do
Damned if I don't but love you
Can't seem to see the light
I've done everything but I can't get it right
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't but love you
