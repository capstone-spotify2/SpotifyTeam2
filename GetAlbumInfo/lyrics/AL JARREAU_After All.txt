There, there was a time I knew
That no matter, come what may, love 
Would prevail
And then inside the dreams I knew
Came the question lovers fear 
Can true love fail 
Then I would miss the childhood wish 
And haven't I sung to you 
Of the knight in armor bright 
Faithful and true to you 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Darling, after all
I will be the one to hold you in my arms 
After all 
I will be the one to hold you 
I will be the one to hold you in my arms 
In my arms 

I know in my heart and mind
That no matter, come what may, love will survive
And love, the author of space and time 
Keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive 
And the love that heals the wound 
After the war is through 
Is the knight in armor bright 
Faithful and true to you 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
