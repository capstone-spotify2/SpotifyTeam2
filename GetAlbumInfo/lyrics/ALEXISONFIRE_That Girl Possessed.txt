We won't forget that girl possessed
We won't forget that girl possessed
Possessed

Who knew her legacy would destroy her future?
You had such promise before your rape
You had such promise before your rape

Born innocent but something had to give
Exploitation, erotica and horror
Even a spread in Oui magazine
And then your habit of getting caught
What a frightful night
Born innocent but something had to give

We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
(What a frightful night)
We won't, we won't, we won't 
We won't, forget you
(What a frightful night)

You painted a picture so graphic
That no one could 
They can't see past it
You painted a picture so graphic
That no one could...
They can't see past it

We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
(What a frightful night)
We won't, we won't, we won't 
We won't, forget you
(What a frightful night)
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
(What a frightful night)
We won't, we won't, we won't 
We won't, forget you
(What a frightful night)

We won't forget that girl possessed
We won't forget that girl possessed
Possessed.
