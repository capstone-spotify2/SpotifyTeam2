What if the sun never rose again
What if the sky turned from blue to red
What if the love we once had was never there
What if you told me you loved me but you didn't really care

I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There's nothing to live for with you anyway
I couldn't take another day

But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
What if

What if I knew what could have been
What if you said you were sorry, then
Would it make a difference
'Cause you don't change you keep blowing all your chances
And if I left would you come to your senses
'Cause I'm gonna turn and walk away

I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There's nothing to live for with you anyway
I couldn't take another day

But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
What if

What if
What if
What

I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There is nothing to live for with you anyway

But what if I'm wrong
What if I'm wrong
But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
There won't be anyone, not anyone
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
What if
