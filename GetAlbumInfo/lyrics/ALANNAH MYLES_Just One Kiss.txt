I've heard there's always one that's got to get away
Let 'em go, but you know it's not that easy
I never listen to what the people say
I lose control, I let desire lead me
My concience aches, but it's gonna lose the fight
I don't care, I give it all away tonight
For just one kiss, for just one kiss
For just one kiss, for just one
Of these fantasies I've kept inside my mouth
Lead me on, I will follow gladly
Please, don't be mad at me because I let it show
Is it so wrong to want you to hold me
You got the power that I know I can't resist
My heart is pounding and I'm bound to take the risk
For just one kiss, for just one kiss
For just one kiss, for just one kiss
What did we lose tonight, we'll never know
Should we give love a try or let it go
I can't help what I do
The closer and closer I get to you
My concience aches, but it's gonna lose the fight
I don't care, I give it all away tonight
For just one kiss, for just one kiss
For just one kiss, ah-ah, for just one kiss
(Just one kiss, just one kiss)
(Just one kiss, just one kiss)
(Just one kiss) Get it on, just one
Just one kiss (just one kiss)
(Just one kiss, just one kiss)
(Just one kiss, just one kiss)
