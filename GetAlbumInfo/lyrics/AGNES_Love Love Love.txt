My friends keep saying 
That I need patience 
Fools rush in, better slow down 
They keep talkin' 'bout good things come 
But I don't wanna wait 

My heart is achin' 
I'm not mistaken 
The moment I saw you 
My whole world started to change 
You could be what I've been lookin' for 
I come back for more 
And I want you to know 

I wanna feel love love love 
Lift me up to the sky 
Oh give me love love love 
Take me higher than high 
I will show you heaven 
When I get you alone 
I don't wanna wait anymore 

You see right through me 
Can't hide it for you 
You read my mind 
But I refuse to feel shame 
It's not a crime to want love and more 
It's happened before 
And I want you to know 

I wanna feel love love love 
Lift me up to the sky 
Oh give me love love love 
Take me higher than high 
I will show you heaven 
When I get you alone 
I don't wanna wait anymore 

I'm waiting for a sign 
That you made up your mind 
Don't keep me hangin' on forever 
Don't waste another night 
I don't wanna wait no more 

I wanna feel love love love 
Lift me up to the sky (Don't wanna wait) 
Oh give me love love love 
Take me higher than high 
I will show you heaven 
When I get you alone 
I don't wanna wait anymore 

I wanna feel love love love (Oh! ooo Oh!) 
Lift me up to the sky 
Oh give me love love love (Give me love, give me love) 
Take me higher than high 
I will show you heaven 
When I get you alone 
I don't wanna wait anymore 

love love love 
I don't wanna wait 
I don't wanna wait 
anymore
