Honey I'm home
I don't know what it is, but it keeps calling my name
Can't imagine me leaving this game
I'll tell you what it is, it's the money that calls
That's close them all these fat ass hoes
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Honey I'm home

I've been tapping phone, so I'm talking cold
The shit jumping at the gym and I ain't talking pro's
Polo on my draws, Bentley on my driveway
I was in the trap while you was on myspace
Money on my mind stay, increase the crime rate
Pinky ring so big, you can see it on a blind day
Car game, I rate, whip parked outside
SS on it, and that stands for south side
Outside, cooling, deuce and the juices
2 cups on me, shouts out to Houston
We got a problem Houston, they taking my stile they boosting
They lame and they all know it
Ask your girl and they all know it

Honey I'm home
I don't know what it is, but it keeps calling my name
Can't imagine me leaving this game
I'll tell you what it is, it's the money that calls
That's close them all these fat ass hoes
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Honey I'm home
