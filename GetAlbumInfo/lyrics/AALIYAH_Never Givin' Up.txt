Never Giving Up All This Love.
Im Never Giving Up, Your All Im Thinking Of.

Sitting Here, In This Empty Room,
Thinking Bout You Baby.
Thinkin Bout All The Changes, Weve Been Through.
And I Know It Might Sond Crazy, But Im Still Lovin You.
In-Spight Of All The Simple Things, Weve Been Through <i>[Echo]</i>
The Way You Make Me Feel, I Cant Explain.
But I Love What You Do, What You Do To Me.
When Were Making Love, Your Driving Me Insane,
See I Cant Go No Higher.

Never Giving Up All This Love.(Heyyy)
Im Never Giving Up, Your All Im Thinking Of.
Your Always On My Mind All The Time.
Never Giving Up All This Love,
And Ill Always Be There Baby.
Never Giving Up Your All Im Thinking Of.

<i>[Tavarius Polk]</i>
Well, Well, Well
Feels So Strange When I Was On The Train,
I Cracked A Smile, On Every Thought Of You,
The Things That You Do, Makes Me Feel So Good Inside.
No Need To Lie, Im On Your Side,
Ooooh No Need To Lie To You.
Im Givin My Lovin To You Day And Night.
Aaliyah Im Gonna Be Lovin You.
Ohhh Baby Girl,
I Got What You Want, I Got What You Need, Its All In Me
Oh No Ill Never Forgive You For, Givin' Your Love Away
I Gotta Keep It To Myself.

<i>[Aaliyah]</i>
Tavarious,
If You Say What You Mean, And You Mean What You Say.
My Love, My Love Will Be Here Always.
Lately Ive Had The Strangest Feelin,
A Feeling I Cant Deny.
That Angels Watchin Over Us And Our Life.
Angels Watchin Over You, Over Me
Angels Watchin Over You, Over Me
<i>[Repeat]</i>
