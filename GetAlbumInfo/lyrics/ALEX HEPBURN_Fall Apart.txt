I don't live a life
Life lives me
Was born in the shadow
Of who I'd be
Well there's a place in my mind
I go to hide
Where your world where your world and mine collide
I belong to you

Won't take the world to make me see
When I live a lie that I believe
Don't you let me fall into the dark again
Without your light
I'll fall apart

When daylight comes
He'll fade away
I can't let him go
Can't make him stay
I told my heart
He's just a phase
Watching endless lies turn into days
I belong to you

Won't take the world to make me see
When I live a lie that I believe
Don't you let me fall into the dark again
Without your light
I'll fall apart apart

Falling apart apart apart
Falling apart apart apart
I'm falling falling apart
Now I'm falling falling apart

Won't take the world to make me see
When I live a lie that I believe
Don't you let me fall into the dark again
Without your light
I'll fall apart apart
