Crazy
The crazy things I heard you say  Iâm mad about you all the same 
I never really saw the crime Yet went ahead and served my time
I never met someone like you before  But sometimes that is not enough
Cuz I canât help just feeling

I must be crazy for leaving you Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you 
I will regret this chosen mind I never wanna see you cry
I care about u endlessly u deserve a deeper love than me
I donât know if Iâll make it on my own But I tried so hard to let it go
And I canât hide this feeling

And I know that I will miss you like a fool But thereâs something in my life
And I canât hide this feeling I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you
