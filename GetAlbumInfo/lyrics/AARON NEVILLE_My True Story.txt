There is the story that I must tell
Of two lovers that I knew well.

Now they must cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.
Now they must cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.

Her name was Sue Ann,
His name was Earl.
His love was Loraine,
Such a wonderful girl.

Now they must cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.
Cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.

Love will make you happy
And love will make you cry
Love will make your tears fall
When your lover says goodbye.

Now they must cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.
Cry, cry, cry
Their blues away.

The story been there
And it was no lie,
Names have been changed here
To protect you and I.

We must cry, cry, cry
Our blues away.
Cry, cry, cry
Our blues away.

And we must cry, cry, cry
Our blues away.
Cry, cry, cry
Our blues away.
