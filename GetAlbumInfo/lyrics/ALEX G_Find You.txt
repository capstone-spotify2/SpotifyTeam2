I feel your hand close to mine
And your smile is easy to find
So I'll hide this fear
That you're not with me here

And I will laugh with you
Kiss your cheek like you still want me too
Though you're near, I know
That you're not really here

So I'll wait for a sign that says it's not too late
And I'll try to say the love that once was mine
And I'll find, I'll find
Your broken life that used to shine
And I'll find, I'll find you

And I kept your heart
On a chain, around my neck
And you swore to me forever
But forever fell apart

But I'll wait for a sign that says it's not too late
And I'll try to say the love that once was mine
And I'll find, I'll find
Your broken life that used to shine
And I'll find, I'll find you

So come back to me
I've saved your promises in a box beneath my bed
And now your touch is like a memory
And your words are my souvenirs

I feel your hand close to mine
But you're not really here

But I'll wait for a sign that says it's not too late
And I'll try to say the love that once was mine
And I'll find, I'll find
Your broken life that used to shine
And I'll find, I'll find you
