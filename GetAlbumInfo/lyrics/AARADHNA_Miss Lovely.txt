Sheâs ambitious
Man, and sheâs vicious
Really beautiful
I never thought in my life I would never do it again
But now I do

She had a mission
She had a vision
To be with my man
I could swear that I could see the twinkle in her eyes
She had a plan

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Youâd better look the other way
Cause Iâll take that pretty smile
And Iâll turn that pretty smile into a frown

Heâs so faithful
Iâm so grateful he belongs to me
Sheâs tried so many times
But in the end she always finds it
Hard, too much all over me

Iâm losing patience
She will be facing
Me very soon
If she donât stop
Somebody better call the cops 
Cause Iâll go swinging

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Youâd better look the other way
Cause Iâll take that pretty smile
And Iâll turn that pretty smile into a frown

Sheâs the one playing with her hair
Walking âround like she donât care
Sheâs the one that sprinkles all the trouble in the air
Sheâs the type that likes to mess around with other ladiesâ guys
Thatâs Miss Lovely
Sheâs Miss Lovely

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Youâd better look the other
Cause Iâll take that pretty smile
And Iâll turn that pretty smile into a frown

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Youâd better look the other way
Cause Iâll take that pretty smile
And Iâll turn that pretty smile into a frown

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
Iâll take that pretty smile
And Iâll turn that pretty smile into a frown

Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
Iâll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
Iâll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
Iâll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile into a frown
Miss Lovely
