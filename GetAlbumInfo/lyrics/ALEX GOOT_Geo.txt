Can you see, through the eyes of a dreamer.
Does your mind, know the world how it is.
When you sleep, do you dream in numbers.
Write it down, make a plan, check your list.

For the longest time, I believed you were right.
I would live my life, with a logical mind.
When I reach my goals, I donât wanna be stuck.
Iâm thinking about success and what itâs supposed to be next.
Iâd love to learn what I should do, to be as happy as you.

Oh yeahhhhh.

Do you love, what you do. Does it satisfy you?
I need my peace, in my mind, but it seems so hard
(seems so hard) to find.

Oohhhhhhhh.

For the longest time, I believed you were right.
I would live my life, with a logical mind.
When I reach my goals, I donât wanna be stuck.
Iâm thinking about success and what itâs supposed to be next.
Iâd love to learn what I should do, to be as happy as you.

And I never will forget what you have said, âcause you know best.
And the flesh that you have given me, I will never second guess.

Ohhh noooooo.
Ohh Nooooo.

Ohh Ohhhhh.

For the longest time, I believed you were right.
I would live my life, with a logical mind.
When I reach my goals, I donât wanna be stuck.
Iâm thinking about success and what itâs supposed to be next.
Iâd love to learn what I should do, to be as happy as you.
