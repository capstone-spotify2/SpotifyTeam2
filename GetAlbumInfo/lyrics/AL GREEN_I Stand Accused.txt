Girl
I stand accused
Of loving you just a little too much
And I hope (oh Lord)
Sure enough hope it's not a crime
Guilty of loving you
(Oh baby)

I hope that I
That I never never never have to testify
If I do, if I do, everyone's gonna cry, baby
That boy is guilty (lord lord) of loving you

Although you belong to another boy, baby
And I may not stand the ghost of a chance
But I'll tell the world (y'all)
I love her, I need her, baby
And I'm a victim of circumstance
And been proven guilty
Oh, yes, I am, yes I am
Did you know?
One touch (lord lord lord)
And I find myself
Right back, right back on the witness stand
Shouting out, shouting out, shouting out
All over the land
I'm guilty
I'm guilty
Baby!
Please, mama, please...
