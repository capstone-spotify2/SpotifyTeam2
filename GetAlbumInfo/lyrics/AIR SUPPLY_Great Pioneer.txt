It happened long ago
When I felt the need
For a life of my own
I dreampt of summer love
And moving high up north
But no one would go
So I walked up the hill and lay there
Imagining the day was near
I know I want to stay there
And be know as a great pioneer

I made a promise then
That I'd find a place
Where my world won't end
Give me a piece of land
That will be my life
That I will defend
If I work really hard
I will surely survive
I know my virtue is strong
No one could oppose a spirit so raw
To be, oh a part of the state
To be, known as a great pioneer

<i>[Musical break]</i>

I keep the fires burning
To let you know I'm free
My heart will always be yearning

To be, oh, a part of the state
To be, oh, a part of the state
To be, known as a great pioneer

<i>[Musical break]</i>

Oh, a part of the state
To be, oh, a part of the state
To be, known as a great pioneer

And if it all should end
And I hear the call
From the great unknown
I'll need to go my way
Let me have my day
Let me be alone

I'll just walk up the hill and lay there
Knowing that my time is here
I know I wanna stay there

And be, oh, a part of the state
And be, a part of the state
And be, known as a great pioneer
