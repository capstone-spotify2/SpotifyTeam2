You keep me crying all the time
I have to say that you
Keep me crying all the time

Well, I tried to play my music
But my music was too loud
Well, I pleased all the people
But I couldn't please the crowd

And I dropped down on my knees
And said, hey, mama
Won't you clear my head
Don't you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Oh, Lord, don't you know they
They keep me moaning all the time
They keep me burning all the time

Well, I tried
To run my business
But they said I can't
Just keep it to myself
Not bothering any man

Just as sure as I try
Cause my tears in my eye
Don't you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Friends knocking in my door
They keep me crying
Somebody calling on the phone and
They keep me crying...
