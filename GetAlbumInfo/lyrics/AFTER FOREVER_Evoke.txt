So wild, so beautiful and pure
All elements divine
The essence of all life
So vast, extensive and remote
Unbridled and erratic
Savage but glorious

It bursts; its energy is stirring
It calls; its drawing power will enchant us with its might
Its massive spirit's bright
Let it flow!

Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We can not break through nor control
But to feel its true soul, dare to concede and to connect

Emerging waves and brightened skies
The sun burns in your eyes
The wind that blows and pounds

It shines, its energy is whirling
It fights, will not be interfered with people who can't feel it is all nature's flow
Let it flow!

Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We can not break through nor control
But to feel its true soul

Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We can not break through nor control
We should cherish it!

Oh, energy, oh, evoke me
Let it flow!

Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We can not break through nor control
But to feel its true soul
It is not at our command, no!
