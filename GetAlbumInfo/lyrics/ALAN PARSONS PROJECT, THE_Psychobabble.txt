Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night
Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night
It ain't in Kodachrome and it isn't black and white
Take me for a fool if you feel that's right
Well I'm never on my own but there's nobody in sight
I don't know why I'm scared of the lightning

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Trying to reach me
I can't turn to the left or the right
I'm too scared to run and I'm too weak to fight
But I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me

Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night
It's in Dolby stereo but I never hear it right
Take me for a fool well that's alright
Well I see the way to go but there isn't any light
I don't know why I'm scared of the lightning

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
Trying to reach me
Help me to find what I don't wanna know
You're taking me there but I don't wanna go
I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me

Psychobabble all psychobabble
Psychobabble all psychobabble
I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me

You're readin' my mind you won't look in my eyes
You say I do things that I don't realise
But I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me

Psychobabble all psychobabble
Psychobabble all psychobabble

You're lighting a scene that's faded to black
I threw it away cause I don't want it back
But I don't care it's all psychobabble rap
