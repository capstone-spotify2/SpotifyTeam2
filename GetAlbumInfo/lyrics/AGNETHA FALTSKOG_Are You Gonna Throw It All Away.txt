You've been lookin' for a reason
You've been trying to find a way
To find an easy way of leavin'
'Cause you can't find a way to stay

If it's not workin' why can't we work it out?
Baby, it's just so wrong to be walkin' out
Don't walk out

Are you gonna throw it all away, forever?
Aren't you gonna give us one more try, together?
Are you gonna take the love we made
And throw it all away?

We've got somethin' good between us
Something we might never find again
Before you go searchin' for another love
Look at what you've got right in your hand

Wish I could make you see what you'd leave behind, oh
Wish I could change your heart so you'd change your mind
Change your mind

Are you gonna throw it all away, forever?
Aren't you gonna give us one more try, together?
Are you gonna take the love we've made
And throw it all away?
Oh, don't throw it all away

If it's not working, why can't we work it out?
Oh baby, it's just so wrong to be walking out
Don't walk out, darlin'

Are you gonna throw it all away, forever?
Aren't you gonna give us one more try, together?
Are you gonna take the love we've made
And throw it all away?
Throwing it all away

Are you gonna throw it all away, forever?
Aren't you gonna give us one more try, together?
Are you gonna take the love we've made
And throw it all away?
Throwing it all away

Are you gonna throw it all away, forever?
Aren't you gonna give us one more try, together?
Are you gonna take the love we've made
And throw it all away?
