I can push the buttons
I can wrestle with the phantoms
Till I see that all the best things happen naturally
There's nothing I can say to you
The facts and figures make it true
There's nothing else to figure out
The universe will fold in half for us

C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself

I can learn the lessons
I can formulate the questions
I can dig and bring to light the heart of everything
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
There's nothing else to figure out
The universe will fold in half for us

C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself

Why do you torture yourself for no one?
Why do you keep on the fight?
It's already won

C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself
