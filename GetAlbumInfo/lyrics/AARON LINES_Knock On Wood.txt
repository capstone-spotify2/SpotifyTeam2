Never been the kind of guy who walks around ladders
And I open up umbrellas when I'm inside
Well, black cats that crossed my path, they never mattered
But I've never had this much at stake
Don't want to lose her by tempting fate

So I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood

Well, it's been two weeks and everything is coming up aces
But I've seen my luck come, and I've seen it go
And for the first time in my life, I'm not hesitating
I knew after just one dance, I wasn't leaving this up to chance

I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood, yeah

Well, I've got my rabbit's foot around my neck
That old wishing well's got half my paycheck
Got a bag of four-leaf clovers
Anything to be her lover

Knock on wood
Knock on wood

I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
Knock on wood

Knock on wood
