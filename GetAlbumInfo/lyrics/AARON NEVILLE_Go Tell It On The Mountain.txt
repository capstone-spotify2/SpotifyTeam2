Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I say go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds
Kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Down in that lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
God sent to us salvation
Born that Christmas morn

Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

I said go
Tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born

I say go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Hey go
Ttell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
