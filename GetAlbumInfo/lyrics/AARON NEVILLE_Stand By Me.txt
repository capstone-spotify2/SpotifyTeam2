When the night has come and the land, it is dark
And the moon is the only light that we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me

If the sky, we look upon should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble into the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, and I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, my darlin', please stand by me

If the sky, we look upon should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble into the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, please stand by me
Whenever I'm in trouble won't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, stand by me, oh darlin', please stand by me
