They're all still on their honeymoon
Just read the dialogue balloon
Everyone loves you, why should they not?
And I'm the only one who knows
That Disneyland's about to close
I don't suppose you'd give it a shot
Knowing all that you've got

Are cigarettes and Red Vines
Just close your eyes, 'cause, baby
You never do know
And I'll be on the sidelines,
With my hands tied,
Watching the show

Well, it's always fun and games until
It's clear you haven't got the skill
In keeping the gag from going too far
So you're running 'round the parking lot
'Til every lightning bug is caught
Punching some pinholes in the lid of a jar
While we wait in the car

With cigarettes and Red Vines
Just close your eyes, 'cause, baby
You never do know
And I'll be on the sidelines,
With my hands tied,
Watching the show

And tell me, would it kill you
Would it really spoil everything
If you didn't blame yourself
Do you know what I mean?

Cigarettes and Red Vines
Just close your eyes, 'cause, baby
You never do know
And I'll be on the sidelines,
With my hands tied,
Watching the show
Watching the show
