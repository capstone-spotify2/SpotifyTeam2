I need somebody who can feel me <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Refrain (x2):]</i>
I need somebody who can feel me
I wanna dance, move, get into the groove
I need somebody who can feel me
I wanna dance, move, get into the groove
I need somebody who can feel me.

<i>[I:]</i>
Come on now, if <i>[?]</i> somehow
Move on girl, don't wait anymore
I am here I know what you must feel
Life goes on, don't wait anymore..

<i>[II:]</i>
Oh why run and hide?
Tonight don't you cry...
I can set you free
My baby, can't you see...
