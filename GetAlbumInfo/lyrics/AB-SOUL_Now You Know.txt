Try to relax, try to relax
I know you're anxious, baby
I know you're anxious, for me

I wrote the majority of this rap on a bean bag under the JMZ train tracks, the Bro P on the motherfucking boards, homeboy
(If you don't know, now ya know nigga)

Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doin' what I want to

I hit the Bodega for the backwoods
Pack of dutchies if you lucky nigga

Adam's rib ain't adding up, this story must be more extensive (YMF nigga)
Meiosis, mitosis and some mo' shit

Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to
I hit the Bodega for the backwoods
Pack of dutchies if you lucky nigga (cross your fingers)
Cups with the ice just doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to

You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to
Baby, you know what I'm up to

I, Soulo, still a member in good standing of the he-man woman haters club.
Do solemnly swear to be a he-man and hate women and not play with them or talk to them unless I have to,
and especially, never fall in love, and if I do may I die slowfully and painfully and suffer for hours, or until I scream bloody murder
