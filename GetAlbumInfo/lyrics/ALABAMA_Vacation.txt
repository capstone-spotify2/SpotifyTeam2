Well it's time for my vacation
It's time for me to have some fun
Yes, it's time for my vacation
I wanna lay out in the sun in Florida

Cause I've been working every weekend
I've been working overtime
Now it's time for my vacation
Have nothing on my mind, that's right

Goin' swimmin' in the blue hole
And fishin' with an ol' cane pole

Cause I can't be like Walter Mitty
It must be real, it must be right
Cause it's dog eat dog to the pinnacle
And success is an uphill fight

I am fresh and clean every morning
And dead on my feet every night

Said it's time for my vacation
It's time for me to have some fun
Yes, it's time for my vacation
I wanna lay out in the sun all day long

We are back to basics
And count my blessings one by one

We're up for school by seven
Got exams all week long
It's been study study study
But come Friday gonna be gone
I'm gonna get out of here

R and R on Saturday and Sunday
And party, party on and on

Well I've been drivin' on the freeway
Traffic slipped and traffic slide
It's wall to wall insanity
Blowin' horns or showin' lights

Should I wind my watch in frustration
Or should I go flying high, no

Gonna take my vacation
Travel on beach to have some fun
Cause it's time for my vacation
I wanna lay out in the sun, all day long

Headed back for Mother Nature
And party, party all night long
