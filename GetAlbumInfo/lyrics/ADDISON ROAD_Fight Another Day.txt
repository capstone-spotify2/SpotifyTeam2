Your broken dreams, your crazy schemes
They always let you down
The things we chase, a hopeless race
Youâre breathless on the ground
From soaring heights to crashing dives
A peace yet to be found
But you could spend a lifetime running
You could spend a lifetime running

And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot
Are you living every day like itâs the last youâve got
Will you step aside when it all falls down and watch it burn away
Have a little faith when the walls cave in
Pray for strength to fly against the wind
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot
Or fight another
Another day

Your fractured heart, your disregard
It leaves you frozen still
A slow withdrawal from it all
That keeps you unfulfilled
Will you spend a lifetime running
âCause you could spend a lifetime running

And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot
Are you living every day like itâs the last youâve got
Will you step aside when it all falls down and watch it burn away
Have a little faith when the walls cave in
Pray for strength to fly against the wind
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot
Or fight another
Another day

Even when your heartâs been broken
Heâll be there with arms wide open
Be strong and his love will lead you
To fight another day

Keep your head to the sun âcause itâs shining on you, on you
