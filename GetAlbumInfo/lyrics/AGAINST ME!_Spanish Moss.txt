You just need to find some place to get away.
You can forget your name.
And there's no need to apologize.

It could be a good life.
It could be such a very good life.
We could find a place for just me and you.
Need some place to stay safe, need some place to stay safe and warm.
Why don't we deserve the same?

You just need to find some place to get away.
You can forget your name.
And there's no need to apologize.

Look into the Spanish moss.
Let your mind conjure up old ghosts.
Ride you bike through lost Florida streets.
Everything we've said and done, can be so easily forgotten.
You can always change who you are.

You just need to find some place to get away.
You can forget your name.
And there's no need to apologize.
I caught a glimpse of this life, it could be such a very good life.
We could find a place for just me and you.
But it's not yours to keep.
Yeah, the truth will tear your heart out.
In a world run by gangsters you're stuck standing in a bread line.

You just need to find some place to get away.
You can forget your name.
And there's no need to apologize.
