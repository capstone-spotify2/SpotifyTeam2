i sold my soul for a one night stand
I followed alice into wonder land
i ate the mushroom and i dance with the queen
yeah we dancing inbetween all the lines
i followed daylight right into the dark
took to the hatter like a walk in the park
but then i met her yeah she felt so right
no shadow (?) the night yeah it was she
they call her sunshine
the kind that everbody knows
yeah yeah
they call her sunshine
she's finer than a painted rose
yeah yeah
sunshine
yeah
her kind of love is what i adore
what kind of trouble am i in for
my kind of heaven lies in hells back door
and i got more than i need
cause i need sunshine
the kind everbody knows
yeah yeah
my sunshine she's finer than a painted rose
yeah yeah sunshine yeah
i got the karma but it dont come free
i chased that rabbit up an old oak tree
that catapilar is tryin to cop a plea
the smoke aintt got nothing on me
I got to have my sunshine
the kind that everybody knows
yeah yeah
sunshine
finer than a painted rose
sunshine the kind that everybody knows
my sunshine she's finer than a painted rose
sunshine
sunshine yeah yeah
