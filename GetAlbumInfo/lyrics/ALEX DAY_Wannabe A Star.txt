Woaaaaaah!

Woaaaaaah!

(please enter)

Take me,
Take me out tonight,
Take me out alive.

(ohhh)

Break me,
Break me for my art,
Break me into a star...

Coz there's a world of fame so close it's burning me,
Push me to my limits I can stand any...

I'll sing until you scream,
I'm begging on my knees,
I promise not to eat,
Just give me what I need,

I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,

Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!

Tell me,
Tell me how to dress,
Tell me I'm a mess,

(ohhh)

Tell me,
Tell me when I'm done,
So I can carry on...

Coz there's a world of wealth so close it's bruising me,
Kick me through the door, just give me what I need!

I'll sing until you scream,
I'm begging on my knees,
I promise not to eat,
Just give me what I need,

I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,

Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!

I'll sing until you scream,
I'm begging on my knees,
I promise not to eat,
Just give me what I need,

I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,

I'll sing until you scream,
I'm begging on my knees,
I promise not to eat,
Just give me what I need,

I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,

Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!
Woaaaaaaah!

I'll sing until you scream,
(Woaaaaaaah!)
I'm begging on my knees,
(Woaaaaaaah!)
I promise not to eat,
(Woaaaaaaah!)
Just give me what I need,

I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,
I wannabe a star,

I wannabe a star.
