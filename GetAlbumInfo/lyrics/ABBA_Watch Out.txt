You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing

You'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out, watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out
I said, "You'd better watch out"

It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

You'd better watch out
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I've tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So, you'd better watch out
Yes, I said, "You'd better watch out"
Watch out, watch out

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said, "You'd better watch out"
Oh, girl you'd better watch out
Ah, you'd better watch out
Ooh, ah, you'd better watch out
