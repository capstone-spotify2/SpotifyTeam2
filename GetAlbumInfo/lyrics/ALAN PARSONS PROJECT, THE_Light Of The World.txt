I am just a stranger, in a promised land
I am only learning a game with the rules I don't understand
Going round in circles, I've been round before
I am lost in so many ways
I can walk no more
I can walk no more

I am just a drifter, in an open sea
But no matter how much I try, the tide will not turn for me
Going round in circles, till I reach the shore
I am blown by so many winds
I can take no more
I can take no more

Light of the world, I stand alone,
Cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

I am just a dreamer, when I close my eyes
I can fly so close to the sun, that I cannot see it rise
Going round in circles, in a silent sky
I am lost for so many words
I cannot say why
I cannot say why

Light of the world, I stand alone,
Cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

Just a traveller, on an endless flight
But no matter which way I turn, I journey into the night
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall
To believe in so many truths
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

Light of the world, I stand alone,
Cause I could not see the light of the world
I was afraid, 'cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye
