She convinced my heart she's all I'm living for
Cupid shot in the dark, the arrow's on the floor
Take me back to the start and I'd relive it all
Oh, we could make a new start if you forgive it all
I know I made mistakes but I was only young
You don't know what you have until you make it go
I spend my time just thinking about life and love
If there's no love in life, there's just nothingness

I know I'd make you happy
I know you'd make me smile
And if all your friends are busy
I'll stay up with you all night
Cause I wanna kiss your lips once more
Put cushions on the bedroom floor
I wanna be a better man
Please understand

That I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be
I just wanna be close to you, close to you

She convinced my heart she's all I'm living for

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be
I just wanna be close to you, close to you

Close to you
Close to you
Close to
You
