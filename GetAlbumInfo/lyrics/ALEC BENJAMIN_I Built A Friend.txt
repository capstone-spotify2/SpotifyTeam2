I built a friend with 3 pieces of plastic and a pen
I made him on the table in the den
I gave him my old cell phone for a head, for a head
And we spent holidays at my house
And we left presents in a stocking
And we bought bolts and things and strings
And a new watch, that's what he got

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I came home to find him on the table
With a note, scribbled out in pencil
And he wrote, that he just wasn't stable all alone, all alone
Next to him, an empty glass of water
That he spilt, all over the body
That I built, it fizzled and it popped
And then it killed, and then it killed

And we had so much fun together
We thought we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I built a friend
