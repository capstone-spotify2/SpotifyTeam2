When Can We Spend Some, 
D.O.W.N Time, 
Wanna Spend Some Down Time, 
With You Baby Down Time, 
Wanna Spend All Of That, 
D.O.W.N Time, 
Wanna Spend Some Down Time, 
With You Baby Down Time. 

I'm Sitting Up Here In My Room, 
And I Just Cannot Stop Thinking About You, 
I Can Picture Us K.I.S.Sing, 
And Every Thing That Lovers Do, 
I Wanna Get To Know You, 
So I Can Get To Hold You, 
Wanna Stop The Waiting Game, 
I'm Gonna Come Over To You, 
And Ask You If You Want To.... 

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
Chill With Me, 
Spend Some Quality, 
Baby We Can Talk On The Phone, 
Anything U Wan' To, 
Its Up To You...

When Can We Spend Some, 
D.O.W.N Time, 
Wanna Spend Some Down Time, 
With You Baby Down Time, 
Wanna Spend All Of That, 
D.O.W.N Time, 
Wanna Spend Some Down Time, 
With You Baby Down Time. 

I Am Searching For A New Boo, 
And I Hope That Its Gonna Be You, 
You Really Rinin' My Bell, 
And Baby I Can Tell, 
That Your Really Feeling Me To, 
Come And Get To Know Me, 
So You An Get To Hold Me, 
Wanna Set The Holla Back, 
Name A Time, Name Place, 
Nema Day You Want To...... 

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
Chill With Me, 
Spend Some Quality, 
Baby We Can Talk On The Phone, 
Anything U Wan' To, 
Certainly Talk To Me...... 

When Can We Spend Some,

Wanna Spend Some Down Time, 
With You Baby Down Time, 
Wanna Spend All Of That, 
D.O.W.N Time,

With You Baby Down Time.  

We Can Drink Some Lemonade, 
Under That Big Oak Tree, 
We Can Go Down Town, 
Watch A Movie, 
Just Spend Time With Me, 
Baby You Will See, 
We'll Be Happy, 
So Tell Me When Can We.... 

When Can We Spend Some,
