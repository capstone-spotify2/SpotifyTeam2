The first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields where they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel

And let us all
With one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath in heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind hath bought

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel

Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King
