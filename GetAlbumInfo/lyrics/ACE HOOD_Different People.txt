We are different people
Born alone I'm a die alone nigga, a renegade
We are different people, we are
We are different people, we are
We are different people, check
... Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations
Different aspirations,

Mama was a hustler, daddy was a dead beat
Chance of me out the hood was rarer than some red meat
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep
I believe in God but deep inside resides the beast in me
Nightmares of being broke, never seem to be a joke
Sliding with that 44, and my life's been revoke
Blind, erase the real g, paid and I'm still me
Real love the real, I don't respect them niggas in between
I'm like achilles from the troy movie, that do some damage like a full uzi
I am nothing like you other dudes
Same come and goes but we got different views
Snitching under pressure that's a never do
Took the lawyer niggas with me as I'm making moves
Talking tough one with to that killer with you in the booth
I'm prepared to die, question is, are you?

We are different people, we are
We are different people, we are
We are different people, check
... Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations, preach
Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations

They I'll will, I'm prepared to die,
I got the blueprint of how to talk that 45
Surprise, realize I can't be fucked with a no scale
Not the hoes, not the money, the swag
Now my g code, I'm a spray and reload
Hit your toe with a tag,
Niggas hood with it, your ace was good with it
He got that ace, I got the spades
Getaway car, we ready for the way,
Or whatever
I can't be stopped, no... I'm the next sun
Half of million dollars up and get some
Burn on my waist I'm hollow shelling, come get some
I flip, you ain't murder around,
Yeah,.. nigga with the blood clot, don't get blood shot
Murder ain't shit for me, I love taking mug shots
Love taking bitches from paris down to jamaica
Love sitting on the flow of rihanna watching the lakers
I'm a bad boy ain't seen puff in years though
But I keep some B.I.G. Off in my ear lobes, hood

We are different people, we are
We are different people, we are
We are different people, check
Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations, preach
Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations
Mama was a hustler, daddy was a dead beat
Chance of me out the hood was rarer than some red meat
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep, now I lay me down to sleep
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep.
