You better get a lawyer

When you said that it was time
To change your point of view
Never entered in my mind
That what you meant was
we were through
Jumpin' to conclusions
Is really not my style
And if it's just illusion
It'll vanish in a while
Perhaps the pain and stingin'
Is only in my mind
I can change my thinkin'
But my heart is cryin' ouch

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
High Crime
(What you doin' to me)
That you don't love me
(That you don't love me)
High, high crime
(In the first degree)
That you refuse my company
High, high crime
(What you doin' to me)
That you don't love me
(That you don't love me)
High, high crime
(In the first degree)
That you refuse to stick with me
(You refuse to stay)

Don't you get the message

So this crazy night is through
And here's the mornin' sun
Even though I still love you
It's time to go and have some fun
So get yourself a lawyer
And I'll meet you down in court
Pray the judge is for ya
'Cause I'm claiming non-support
Here's my deposition
You left me high and dry
You left me with a photograph
You didn't even sign

<i>[CHORUS: 2X]</i>

High crime...
...That you refuse my company
(You refuse to stay)
Stick with me
High crime
(Better get a lawyer)
That you don't love me
(That you don't love me)
High, high crime
(Better get a lawyer quick)
That you refuse to stick with me
High, high crime...
