Iâll scratch a mystery just please continue
On with your crime. Itâs not that I donât mind.
Or, if you prefer, Iâll pen a murder
To pass your time - your empty time.

I left a little something on the altar for you.

So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you will find them
(My hidden knives)
So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you'll find them
And weâll put pen to page

There is no mystery in my cadence.
Iâve penned the end over smarter lines
But we both prefer romantic murder
To erase time and my, my empty life.

I left a little something on the table for you.

So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you will find them
(My hidden knives)
So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you'll find them
And weâll put pen to page

Oh, you know me well.
(Oh, you know me well)
Oh, you know me well.
(Oh, you know me well)
Well enough to find
(Oh, you know me well)
Surely sharpened knives.

I left a little something on the table for you.

So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you will find them
(My hidden knives)
So poorly Iâve hidden knives
You will find them, you'll find them
And weâll put pen to page
