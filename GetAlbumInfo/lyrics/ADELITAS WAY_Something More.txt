Sometimes the dreams you have are burning down
Sometimes you walk alone, there's no one else around
Don't care about the rules they're telling me
I know that things aren't always what they seem

I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Dreaming like this just you and I
Living each moment, passing by
Watching the starlight in the sky
I want something more
I want something more

Sometimes your heart gets buried underneath
Sometimes your soul is just a raging sea
I saw your face under the northern lights
And if you ask I couldn't tell you why

I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Dreaming like this just you and I
Living each moment, passing by
Watching the starlight in the sky
I want something more
I want something more

Sometimes the dreams you have are burning down
Sometimes you walk alone, there's no one else around
Sometimes you walk alone, sometimes you walk alone
I don't want to walk alone, I want you to take me home

I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Dreaming like this just you and I
Living each moment, passing by
Watching the starlight in the sky
I want something more
I want something more

Sometime the dreams you have are burning down
Sometimes you walk alone, there's no one else around
