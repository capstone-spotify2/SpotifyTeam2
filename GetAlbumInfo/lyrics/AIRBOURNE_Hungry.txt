School is nothing but a waste of time
I've had enough of being led by the blind
I grabbed a guitar and I stole a van
I'm hitting the highway in a rock'n'roll band

I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry

Lady luck pays no attention to me
But I don't care I got all I need
I'm calling the shots I got something to say
I'm on the road to the top yeah my own way

I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry
I'm hungry
I'm hungry
I'm hungry
I'm hungry eat you alive

Bullets rip and blaze overhead
As I'm charging through the hot lead
I'm runnin' wild, I'm born to kill
I'll raise the flag on top of the hill

I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm, I'm, I'm hungry, I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry, I'll eat you alive
Hungry
I'm hungry
I'm, I'm hungry

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm hungry
And I'll eat you alive

I'm hungry and I'll eat you alive
