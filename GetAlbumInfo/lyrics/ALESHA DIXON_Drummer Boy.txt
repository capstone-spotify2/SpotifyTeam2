I think I need a better drummer 

I need a drummer boy (boy) 
A better drummer boy (hey) 
Pick up your stick (ha) 
Hit me with your best (shot) 

Ehh, Ohh, Oh- 

I need a drummer boy. 
Be my little drummer 

Ehh, Ohh, Oh- 

Pick up your stick (ha) 
Hit me with your best (shot) 

I need a fella 
Who is fancy 
Step into my love. I'll show you how to romance 
He give it to me, to the beat of the drum 

Swing away, and away. Ba da pa (pa)- 

I can't hear it. I wanna hear it. 
Louder, Louder, Louder 

I need a drummer boy (boy) 
A better drummer boy (hey) 
Pick up your stick (ha) 
Hit me with your best (shot) 

Ehh, Ohh, Oh- 

I need a drummer boy. 
Be my little drummer 

Ehh, Ohh, Oh- 

Pick up your stick (ha) 
Hit me with your best (shot) 

I like them strong 
Simple and dumb 
They wanna bang my drum 
But it can't be done 

They like the way I shake my tambourine 
I got a boom and a bing, baby you never seen 

Turn me on, baby 
I'm the boss 
Mean what I say, and say what I mean 

I can't feel it. I wanna feel it. 
Harder, Harder, Harder

I can't feel it. I wanna feel it.
