Here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Unbolt your door now, don't be a bore now.
Here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Please let me in, 'cause once I'm in you're in heaven,
I promise you, mmm, you've got it coming to you,
I'm here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Once I get in you'll see just why I'm here.

You're a teaser and I've found you're fond of playing hard to get,
Still you've let me feel we'd make it ever since the day we met.
I can't stand it any longer, don't know what you're waiting for
So I've come to get what's mine behind your barricaded door.

Here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Unbolt your door now, don't be a bore now.
Here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Please let me in, 'cause once I'm in you're in heaven,
I promise you, mmm, you've got it coming to you,
I'm here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Once I get in you'll see just why I'm here.

Mmm, here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Unbolt your door now, don't be a bore now.
Here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Please let me in, 'cause once I'm in you're in heaven,
I promise you, mmm, you've got it coming to you,
I'm here for your love so please don't hinder me,
Once I get in you'll see just why I'm here.
