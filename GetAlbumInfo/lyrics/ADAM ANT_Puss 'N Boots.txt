Boots... Kitty, Kitty!

Pussycat's going to London
Looking for love and for fame
I wish somebody had told her
City folks ain't the same
Pussycat carries a postcard
Won't the big city be nice
That's the place with the action
She's gonna have her a slice

Pussycat, Pussycat where have you been?
I've been to London, now I'm queen
Sitting pretty, I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me -
Puss 'n Boots

Pussycat laughs at the warnings
Where there's a will there's a way
I think you'd agree if you saw her
Rome's built in a day
Pussycat's read all the papers
Seen the movie and knows
All the streets lead to somewhere
And the pavement's gold

Pussycat, Pussycat where have you been?
I've been to London, and now I'm queen
Sitting pretty, I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me -
Puss 'n Boots

Although you know it's wrong
We must do it everyday
When the morning comes
Don't you turn around and say
It's bound to end in tears
So let's do it anyway

Pussycat wasn't a kitten
And not as dumb as they thought
She had a good head on her shoulders
And beauty that couldn't be bought
The royalty made her an offer
If she'd keep trouble at bay
They'd give her the money and diamonds
Be queen for a day

Pussycat, Pussycat where have you been?
I've been to London, and now I'm queen
Sitting pretty, I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me -
Puss 'n Boots

Pussycat, Pussycat where have you been?
I've been to London, and now I'm queen
Sitting pretty, I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me -
Puss 'n Boots
