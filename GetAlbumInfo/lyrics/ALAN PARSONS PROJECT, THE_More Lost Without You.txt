There's Not A Day
I Don't Think Of Your Name
The State That I'm In
You're Completely To Blame
No Words Left To Say
Turn My Dreams All To Grey
And I'm More And More Lost Without You

You're A Storm In My Head
That Really Blew A New Day
A Liquid Design
Is What You Do To My Mind
No Words Left To Say
Cause My Mind's Gone Away
And I'm More And More Lost Without You

More And More Lost Without You
I Was Found But Then I Totally Lost You
Don't Know A Soul That Could Ever Doubt You
That's Why I'm More And More Lost Without You

More And More
