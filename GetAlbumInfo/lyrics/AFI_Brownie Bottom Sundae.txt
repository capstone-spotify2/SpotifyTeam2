Into the dark is where you're draggin me
and into your dark is where I never want to
be. I know I'm not alone and I really want to leave.
Into the dark is where you want to watch me bleed. 
I'm feeling kinda trapped, I gotta go.
I'm feelin' kinda trapped don't you know. I'm feelin
kinda trapped I gotta go.
I gotta go.
I'm being dragged down, for how long, I don't know.
I'm being dragged down and I rise up way
too slow. I know I don't belong here and I think I ought to go.
I hope that I can leave here, leave here with my soul.
