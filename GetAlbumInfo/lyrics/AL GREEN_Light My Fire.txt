You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I were to come up to you and say
Girl we couldn't get much higher
light my fire
light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for messin' around children is through
and I ain't got time to wallow in the mire
(huh ha ha excuse me)
But darlin' we can only lose
Yeah
And and all our love become a funeral pyre
But all I want you to do is
Please baby
light my fire
stick a match stick a match to my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Light my fire
please please please 
light my fire 
light my fire 
try to set the night on fire

Oooh Teenie play your guitar

ooooooooooh

Baby light my fire
all you gotta do is stick a match to my fire
Ooh yeah
Gotta set the night on fire

Ba-by
Ba-by
Oh we're workin ya'll
We're workin' ya'll

I can see see us
Comin' in the park
Doin' something mighty good in the dark
ha ha ha ha ha
Yeow
Baby...
