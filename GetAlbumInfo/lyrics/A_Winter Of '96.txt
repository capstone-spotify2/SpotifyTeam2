First stepped out of the aeroplane
I'd felt like I'd been here before
Took a ?? me down
Put a smile on my face
Felt like I could do more

How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a graveyard

Six foot deep, bleaker street, no one lives out
People smile, never got the time
I look down I can not see the ground
A man who reads the news says there's no crime
There's no one around
There wasn't a sound
There's no one to arrest today

Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96

-10, 1pm east village time
I laugh at your ?? you bought
Snow, snow, so we walk 70 blocks
On days like this nothing seems to far
Get in shot, I don't ask a lot
The weather was frozen, there wasn't a ??

Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96

Maybe I could be here a long time
Much longer than I planned to stay
No telling when they'll get the airport open
No telling when i'll get way
Trying to tell us nothing's wrong
Trying to get the fire back on
Never lost a day of fun
Silence in the heightened mass of ??

How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a gridlock
