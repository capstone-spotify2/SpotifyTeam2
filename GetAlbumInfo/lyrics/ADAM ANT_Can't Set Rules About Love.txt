I feel suspended in space
In another time and place
To talk would burst the bubble
Just want to lie next to you
And appreciate the view
And hope it lasts forever
We do not have to play games
Or listen to all the names
They have for Russian roulette
If it's good enough for the Gemini Guys
Then it's good enough for me
You can't set rules about love
You can't set rules about love
So the I becomes we
We make our own chemistry
To move is too much trouble
I hope we won't separate
Return to our normal state
As long as we're together
So if it's yes or it's no
Chime time says the radio
Why don't you kiss me deadly
If and when you slip away
Just don't let me hear you say
Good morning and goodbye
Revolution -- the fourth and final part
Revolution -- afterplay with my heart
