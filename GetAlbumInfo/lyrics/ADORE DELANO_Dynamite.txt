We're not supposed to be meeting like this
But when we get close I know we're gonna kiss
Can't keep my cool when I'm dancing with fire
Fire, fire

Keep tryna dip but I'm fixed on your face
Thirsty for you in an animal way
How do you do what you do to me babe
Fire, fire

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Woah
You're lookin like dynamite, dynamite
Woah
You're lookin like dynamite, dynamite
Dynamite

You got me runnin' I can't catch my breath
Watching you move got me actin' obsessed
What's got to happen to get you undressed
You're fire, fire

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It's gonna blow up in my face
But c'mon light me up anyway
Sparks about to fly
I'm pushin' up tonight
Up tonight
You're dynamite
You're dynamite, oh
