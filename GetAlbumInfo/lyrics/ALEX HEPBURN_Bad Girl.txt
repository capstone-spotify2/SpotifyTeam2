I know a place in London town
I call it the long way home
Where the shadows seek the light
I'll be creeping through the night
And you know
Know I ain't alone

I've been a bad bad girl
All my life
I'm gonna rock your fragile little mind
I've been a bad bad girl
I've been a bad bad girl
If you see me don't just stand there
Step into my world

I know I was raised to be a good little devil
To be seen but I've always been heard
Cause something deep inside me cried
You will not crush my pride
No you won't no you won't
Baby pluck this little bird

I've been a bad bad girl
All my life
I'm gonna rock your fragile little mind
I've been a bad bad girl
I've been a bad bad girl
If you see me don't just stand there
Step into my world

It gets so hard
Hard sometimes
And I don't wanna let myself
But I just can't help myself
No no no

I've been a bad bad girl
All my life
I'm gonna rock your fragile little mind
I've been a bad bad girl
I've been a bad bad girl
If you see me don't just stand there
Step into my world
