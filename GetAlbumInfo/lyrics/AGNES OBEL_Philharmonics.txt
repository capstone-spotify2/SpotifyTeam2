Guess who died, 
last night
In grey stockings, 
in all might
It was no loss
The only God of mine

He fell down, 
just to drown
In a sea 
of delight
To tame champagne
And creatures of the night

As the water, 
took him over
Filled his lungs, 
inside out
I sold his gold
For flowers and rice

Speaking fire, 
he would hire
Pawns and peasants 
just like me
To feed upon the conquered ones
But now we are free
