I didn't expect them to know my name
Surrounding me like a black steel frame
I saw the world go up in flames
And I just smiled and stood there, watching

And it doesn't seem like this is real
That's just the way I feel
I don't know why

But I've learned from my mistakes
This time I will escape
I'm too young to die

We're all too young to die

It doesn't seem like this is real
That's just the way I feel
I don't know why

But I've learned from my mistakes
This time I will escape
I'm too young to die
