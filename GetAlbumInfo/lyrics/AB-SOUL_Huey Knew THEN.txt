Check it out, hey
This is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And if you roll another blunt and keep your mouth shut
I'll tell you how I became the wicked nigga they call Young Mind Fuck
Black out, black out
(Youngin' from Del Amo)
Black out, black out
(Belt by Ferrigamo)
Black out, black out, black out, yeah
Ay, black out

They speak highly of me when I raise my voice
I gotta shoot a fucking free throw to make my point
My wittiness leave 'em stuck in the wilderness
You need a backwood to roll to this joint
I'm Robin Hood in Robin jeans, you follow me?
Never mind I'm tired of tight analogies
Still in pursuit of happiness in the midst of the madness
With middle fingers to bitches with badges that go oink
(Yeah! Yeah!)
I'm on the fence with Common Sense
My logic is sound, talk of the 90746
No shit, Sherlock
Remind 'em of Han Solo on the battlefront
Everybody behind Soulo and they backin' up
I just threw my two-step, let her back it up
Go on back it up, go on back it up...
You dry snitchin', I'm sliding in something moist
You annoy these women, I anoint these women
You stressin' on my schedule and appointment with 'em
They let me cut so much, I bring ointment nigga
I'm lubricant slick baby
I'm hornier than the brass section of the band, you understand?
Pick your poison, it's your choice

Hey, I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
(Lil homie from the hood)
Yeah, with a belt by Ferragamo
(Yeah bitch I look good)
Hey, just doing want I wanna
This ain't marijuana, please don't tell my mama

I'ma black out, black out, black out, black out
You telling white lies while I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Pale white horse when I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Spark the white lighter then I black out
Even white lives matter when I black out
Bucket of black paint in-front the white house nigga

(Yeah! Yeah!)
I hope I'm in Obama's iPod
Yeah, 'fore I had a desktop
Was looking for a shortcut to be an icon
But this time it's for the money my nigga
Me and the Ichabod Don got itchy palms
And I just left Emmet's with a jar and a intercom
I'ma act an ass and have a donkey to pin it on
I'm winning no matter what the decision's depending on
I'm sinister, picture a ticking bomb in the Pentagon
The typical shit I've been on, remember the pen is gone
Your pinnacle's penny pinching, I'm getting nickels for my thoughts
Like Slim Shady in Balmain jeans
Difficult to say I'm vision impaired, all I seen
I'm Yamborghini High, A$AP M-O-B
Your 16 is pint sized to me

Hey, I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
(Lil homie from the hood)
Hey, with a belt by Ferragamo
(Yeah bitch I look good)
Hey, just doing want I wanna
This ain't marijuana, please don't tell my mama

I'ma black out, black out, black out, black out
You telling white lies while I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Pale white horse when I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Spark the white lighter then I black out
Even white lives matter when I black out
Bucket of black paint in-front the white house nigga

Young, no shame, Kurt Cobain, bastard son
With a gun in palm, money, pussy, crime sitting on my mind
No emotion, orange bottles how I deal with mine
Cracking bannies, only time a nigga cross the line
Wrong hand signs'll turn a function to Columbine
Yeah, So, B.o.B's top gunner
Front runner, never die clique, the thing you are not brother
Polo Ralph Lauren is keeping the Glock covered
Pour up medication by the brick
Sipping oil like we're tryna sink a ship
So, Teag, uppers and the downers in the mix
Now the film heads talking 'bout a script
Living my days is a gamble
I guess that's the perks of the set, bet
Ain't nothing certain but dirt that bitch wearing that skirt
So I guess that I'm flirting with death
Need the type of cash cow to get Trump whacked out
Here's the question you should ask
What's the Soul without the Da$H
Never had the option I could back out
If it's 'bout the cash then I act out

<i>[Da$H &amp; Ab-Soul:]</i>
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Yeah, so
