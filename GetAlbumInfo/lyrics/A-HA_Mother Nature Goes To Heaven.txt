Wrong
You never got it wrong
You always got it right
But now some time has passed;
Youâre ever so slightly off
Thing you could do asleep
In a not too distant past,
Are trying your patience
Harder now

And though 
Everything moves along
You hope the rumourâs wrong
That Mother Nature 
Goes to heaven

Right
You never got it wrong
It always got away
When you had it nailed
It was ever so slightly off
Sending you somewhere else
Than where you had to be
Making it that much 
Harder now

And though
Youâre struggling to get on track
It pales somewhat to the fact
That Mother Nature goes to heaven

And there will be no sadder day
When all the birds
Have flown away
