Took a lap through my hometown
Knowin' what I know now, turns out
You never really know what's up
Till it really goes down
Thinking about love I lost
Finish lines I crossed
Imma' back deck with a mind full of thoughts
And a drink on the rocks
Everything that made me here, remember thinking 'bout
A whole lot of maybe's here
Month after month, song after song
Hoping maybe this will be my year
But it all came together in the end
Thought it was a phase
Then I turned it to a trend
Look at how I made beginnings off a couple different ends
These eyes seen a lot
I'm lookin' through a different lense
Moved to the City, to do what I gotta do
Haven't stopped for a second
I've been steady making moves
Thought about what I'd say to the younger I
Say she ain't worth the time
But she'll be worth the lines, singin'

Life is a battlefield, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up, the sun is drying your eyes
Life is a battlefield, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up, the sun is drying your eyes

This a new day
This a brand new life
You ain't gotta ask how we did so right
Crack a brew
Take a shot to a brand new vibe
You should see rough roads
It's a brand new ride
Same old kid with a soul so lit
That the whole damn world couldn't sleep on it
Present so present, living like a adolescent
But times I've seen had to add a couple lessons
Feeling like a veteran when I hit the mic now
You ain't gonna get it if you don't by now
Flexin' on anybody looking for the competition
Talk about another style
Chance is I already did it
Your game ain't real, like you busy playing quidditch
You ain't with it, you in scrimmage
You ain't really makin' killings
Send it to the last inning
Are you down to run the play?
Tell anybody throwing shade
The sun is on the way

Life is a battlefield, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up, the sun is drying your eyes
Life is a battlefield, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up, the sun is drying your eyes
