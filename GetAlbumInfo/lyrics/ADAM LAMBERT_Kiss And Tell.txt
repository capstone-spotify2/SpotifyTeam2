<i>[Intro]</i>
Kiss and Tell

(Boy...Boy...Boy) <i>[x2]</i>

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
You tell me to make ya
Feel like you're in Heaven
You tell me you know what you want
You want this now

You love that I'm open
I tell all my business
You know what you are getting when we
Get it on

I've had lots of lovers
And everyone knows it
I gush 'cause we're so fresh
Together

I've nothing to hide
And never no secrets
I gush 'cause we're so fresh
Together

<i>[Pre-chorus]</i>
And I never said it to be mean
I just get so excited
We got into bed I'm not ashamed
No shame

<i>[Chorus - x2]</i>
I'm so good
I kiss and tell
I'm so good
I kiss and tell
So what
I kiss and tell
I got no lies
I got love

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Why can't we all be free
Without any filter
And gush 'cause we're so fresh
Together

Why can't we all be proud
And shout it out loud
Embrace it because
Sex is not the enemy

<i>[Pre-chorus]</i>
And I never said it to be mean
I just get so excited
We got into bed I'm not ashamed
No shame

<i>[Chorus - x2]</i>
I'm so good
I kiss and tell
I'm so good
I kiss and tell
So what
I kiss and tell
I got no lies
I got love

<i>[Outro]</i>
(Kiss and tell) <i>[x4]</i>

(Kiss and tell) <i>[x3]</i>
(I got love) <i>[x6]</i>

I got no lies
I got love
