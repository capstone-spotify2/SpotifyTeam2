I said are you ready?
Ugh, hey, c'mon
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Let's do it (Whoa oh yea)
Are you ready (Whoa oh yea)
Ya, all my ladies, let's do it
C'mon, hey

I know the girls inside they wanna get on with the ladies
But there are always fellas there to stir and make you crazy
They try to get you flaky
Can't find no buts no maybes
You think that girl's a traitor
But that man's the instigator

Turing up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit sing this song
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Why do you think that every girl out there's your enemy,
You're looking at her with the green eye filled with jealousy
It's not the way it's supposed to be,
So c'mon ladies dance with me,
And I'll tell ya,
No, n-n-n-n-n-no, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO

Turing up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit sing this song
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Whoa

Mmm

Feel the rhythm in your body
Gotta lose control
All the ladies get together
We'll be on a roll
Feel it in your soul
If you wanna get on down
Then it's time to look around
We're all the same yeah
You gotta think about it,
You're beating up yourself

(Yeah yeah yeah)

Turing up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit sing this song
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Turing up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit sing this song
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)


Whoa oh yea
Whoa oh yea

Want some of that cushy stuff (Whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Whoa oh yea
Whoa oh yea

Want a little bit sing this song
