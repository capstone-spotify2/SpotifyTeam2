Yeah, if love was money
I would always pay the price
While a million dollars
Will never ever change my life

It's an endless highway
The whisky bars and one-night stands
Lost in a cheap hotel
You know a woman needs a man

Can't you see it's all for you, yeah

Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm giving it to you
Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm living just for you, for you
Alright

So every song I sing
Comes from a lonely heart on stage
But they're still together
More than a thousand miles away

Can't you feel my love for you

Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm giving it to you
Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm living just for you, for you

Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm giving it to you
Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm living just for you

Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm giving it to you
Don't go stealing my soul away
I'm living just for you

Living just in you
