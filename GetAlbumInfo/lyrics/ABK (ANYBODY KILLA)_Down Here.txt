<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
How ya doin'? It's me again! 
Underneath the concrete 
Sewage of the underworld, where the fuckin' dead sleep 
Creepin' and crawlin' with the stench of a rat 
Hear me when I'm comin' but ya don't know where I'm at 
Never seen in the daylight, only in the nighttime 
Huntin' for me something that can increase my lifeline 
I see it all, dead bodies and such 
Ghetto gators goin' crazy when they haven't had they lunch 
The more I kill, the bigger they get 
It's like two Hannibal cannibals and one biscuit 
Who's to blame that my parents hated me 
And put me in the sewer cause they knew I couldn't reach 
Seems like I was there for years 
Before I grew a little bigger and I gave em both a scare 
Now I'm addicted to payin' people back 
Sittin' underneath the sewer caps 
and waitin' for you to pass 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' 

<i>[Violent J]</i>
Sometimes the tunnels get so small 
I have to army crawl 
My way through 
Can you relate to that? 
I can see up ladies skirts 
on their way to work 
Just for a second 
I see they booty and neden 
Tell 'em Killa 

<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
Come and visit us I know it's somewhere that you wanna be 
Gettin' dirty life of no luxury 
Even though this road is so swervy 
This place is still home to me 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' 

<i>[Violent J]</i>
It's always nighttime 
In the pipelines 
I sit in the sewage waistdeep and write rhymes 
I know these sewers 
And which ones are the newest 
And which ones be some underground transit movers 
We like Swamp Thing, down here, damn near 
They throw homeless people in, stab 'em, 
cook 'em right there 
I can dive, roll, somersault, tunnel crawl, spring 
I been bitten by so many fuckin' rats it ain't a thing 
I love this, I crawl through your housepipes 
I'm hiding in your shower nozzle pissin' on your wife 
People down here are hungry, they eat muthafuckas 
Everybody's alone, they always eatin' each other 
I came crawlin' out the toilet, into somebody's john 
I walked out and the family started screamin', it was on 
I ran for the fridge and grabbed everything I could 
And then dove in through the kitchen sink 
and back to tha hood 
I met a hooker down here, ya think they bad up there 
This bitch ain't even have a neden left anywhere 
Just a big hole with nothing in the middle 
Her ugly ass titties had a rat hangin' and chewin' 
off of each nipple 
Runnin' through the dark maze, I know my way 
I know no days, only glowing rays 
Beaming through the sewer hole lids of the streets 
Certain parts, but them parts certainly ain't for me 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' 

<i>[Repeat 4x]</i>
There's no sunlight 
There's no sunlight 
Down Here
