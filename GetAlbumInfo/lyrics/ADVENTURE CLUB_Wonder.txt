Have you wondered
What it could be like?
And I was all set to come back home.
You were after nothing I could give long.
Have you wondered,
What it could be like?
And I was standing back on my feet.
There's nothing there,
So no one better.

And I know I should have held you closer,
And I know I should have treated you better,
In a perfect world.
But we're not always,
What we promise to be.
You caught my words in mid-air.
The silence hung as you caught my eye,
Conversations locked away in my mind.

And I know I should have held you closer,
And I know I should have treated you better.

And I know I should have treated you better,
And I know I should have treated you better,
And I know I should have treated you better.
