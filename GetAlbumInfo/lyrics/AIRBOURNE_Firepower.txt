Here I come, oh yeah listen up
I'm fully loaded I'm lock in stock
I'm going huntin' with a big buckshot
You're in my sights it's time to strike
I got the ammo to go all night

If you need satisfaction
I will be your pump action

Firepower
Firepower
To blow you anyway I got the
Firepower
Firepower
To blow you away
To blow you away

I'm on a mission I'm on top
I got you screaming baby don't stop
You're getting wetter than London Weather
I think I'm drowning but there's nothing better

If you need satisfaction
I will be your pump action

Firepower
Firepower
To blow you anyway I got the
Firepower
Firepower
To blow you away
To blow you away

Like John Wayne

You're getting wetter
Than London weather
Think I'm drowning
But there's nothing better

Firepower
Firepower
To blow you anyway I got the
Firepower
Firepower
To blow you away

Firepower
Firepower
Firepower
I'm gomin' like a freight train
Firepower
I said I said Isaid
I'm gomin' like a freight train
Firepower
To blow you away
I got the Firepower
Firepower
Firepower
To blow you away
To blow you away
