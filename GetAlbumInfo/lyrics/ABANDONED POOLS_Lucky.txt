It's not me
Find someone who loves you
And if not me
Find someone who knows who you are
They're just memories
They can get so mean
Little sacred things
Floating out to sea

I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free

I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be

An empty house
A sacrificial mouse
A head full of lead
Weighing all the things that she said

But I digress
My tunnel vision
Make me pay
I know what i'm missing

I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free

I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be

So won't you please
Find your way back to me
My one and only
Find your way back to me

I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
I like what's free

I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be

And if not me
Find someone who loves you
