Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Fuck that fake shit
Itâs time to get real!
Itâs a party Iâve been hearing that you donât know
And if you didnât come to party, then you gotta go
Hands up in the sky, wave âem round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
How you feeling?
DYNAMITE!
Hands up in the sky, wave âem round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
