It's gone two o'clock
According to my watch
You take your time
Well, take your time but don't take mine

Because I need some help to get a start
My pencil's sharp
My papers see
Go down a mark

Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Nothing to it all

I'm a dim, I'm a dumb
I'm just as numb
As a kid can be
A kid can be, as a kid like me

It's gone three o'clock
Hurry up, hurry up
You still have time
The end of term is all that is on your mind

Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Nothing to it all
Nothing to it all

Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, nothing to it
Nothing to it all

Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, you can do it
Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, you can do it
Calm down, relax a bit
You've got to get on top of it
A-ha, you can do it
You can do it all
You're free tonight
