If your girl only knew That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew That you was dissin' her to talk to me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

If your girl only knew That I would want to kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She would probably leave you alone
