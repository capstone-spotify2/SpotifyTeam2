You say one thing then you do another
You've got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother
You're kickin' the dog cause you can't get the cat
You know it ain't cool but you like it like that

Everybody talkin' 'bout what it is what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you don't need nothin' but you've got to have it all

I wanna know... what kind of love are you on?

Jelly roll Jane, rollin' on the rug
Tokin' on a lover like a brand new drug
Do the same thing every damn day 
Do the same thing, do the same thing
Never seem to get enough

I wanna know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?

When Jack took Jill up that hill
She charged his ass a quarter
Well he flipped his lid, uh, cause what she did
Oh, she shouldn't hadn't oughta...

Rockin' in a cradle with a high school vamp
Screamin' at a homey like an old tube amp
Up, down, sideways, goin' in and out of phase
Everybody asks me why I kiss the girls and make them cry

I wanna know... what kind of love are you on?
I wanna know... what kind of love are you on?
I've gotta know... what kind of love are you on?
