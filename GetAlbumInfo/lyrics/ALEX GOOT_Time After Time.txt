Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Caught up in circles confusion - is nothing new
Flashback - warm nights - almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after 

Sometimes you picture me - I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said - then you say 
go slow - I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
If you're lost you can look - and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows - you're wondering, if I'm OK 
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
If you're lost you can look - and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said go slow 
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds 

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
If you're lost you can look - and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
