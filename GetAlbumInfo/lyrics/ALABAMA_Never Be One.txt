Drift off and dream
In your paper-doll world
Play with the presents
From the boys and the girls
Your big day is over
The cake is all gone
We sang you to sleep
With the birthday song.

No, you'll never be one again
The two's are tumbling on in
Daddy's little girl is growing up in the world
You'll never be one again.

The toy piano is quiet in the hall
As Kermie the frog
Sits watching it all
Soon your legs will grow
And make the tricycle go
And take you away from us all.

No, you'll never be one again
The two's are tumbling on in
Daddy's little girl is growing up in the world
You'll never be one again.

Goodnight Baby
Goodnight Daddy...
