Dressed to kill, Lookig sublime
Into won't take long, And she'll be mine
Now she got me by hand
Into her room we go,
She throws me on the bed and I start to crow,
Dripping with sweat, Body heat
Feel her love hit it's peak
You want more, She's giving more
Like an animal on heat, heat, heat.

When The Girl Gets Hot, The Love Don't Stop
When The Girl Gets Hot, The Love Don't Stop

She slips off her dress, Rips off my jeans
She's hot for sex, She got the mind to please
She chain me to the bed, She's gonna get mean
Her eyes are red, And she's blowing steam
Dripping with sweat, And Body heat
Feel her love Hit its peak
You want more, She's giving more
Like an animal on heat, heat, heat
