<i>[Verse:]</i>
You find your life is not quite like what you thought it would be
And you don't know that you can hold the world in your hand
And all the people surrounding you just want what you have
So you've been weak up until now that your soul has been stripped...
Naked in the sand

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Pick yourself up, and change
Pick yourself up and change

You couldn't see their faces as they were calling your name
Your head was spinning from the laughter of strangers to you
You turned around, your head in your hands as confusion sets in
Was just madness you felt, no more hearts will be broken...
I give you my command

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Pick yourself up, and change
Pick yourself up
All the people around were dying for pleasure, not holding your hand, your hand, your hand
You see my sadness, and pain but all about you thought was the ride, the ride, the ride

<i>[Verse:]</i>
You took for granted, my treasures were given to unworthy hands
You lived a lie, and you still want pity from me
I lost my patience, it's the changing that counts, now open your eyes
Your time is over now, no more wishes to grant your unsavoury demands

Pick yourself up, and change
Pick yourself up and change
C'mon, pick yourself up, and change
Pick yourself up and change
Pick yourself up and change
Pick yourself up and change
