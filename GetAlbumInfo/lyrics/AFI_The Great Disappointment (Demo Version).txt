I can remember, a place I used to go.
Crysanthemums of White, they seemed so beautiful.
I can remember, searched for the Amaranth.
I'd shut my eyes, to see.

Oh how I smiled then, so near the cherrished ones.
I knew they would appear, saw not a single one.
Oh how I smiled then, waiting so patiently.
I'd make a wish, and bleed.

While I waited,
I was wasting away.
While I waited,
I was wasting away.

I can remember, dremt them so vividly.
Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me.
I can remember, when I first realized,
dreams were the only place, to see them.

While I waited,
I was wasting away.
While I waited,
I was wasting away.
While I waited,
I was wasting away,
hope was wasting away,
faith was wasting away,
I was wasting away.

Never never wanted this, always wanted to believe, never never wanted this.
(I will not live on)
Never never wanted this, from the start i'd been decieved, never never wanted this.
(I will not live on)
Never never wanted this, always wanted to believe, never never wanted this all.
Never ever wanted this, from the start i'd been decieved, never never wanted this all.

Inside a crumbling effigy.
(But you promised)
So died all innocence.
(But you promised)
Me.

While I waited,
I was wasting away.
While I waited,
I was wasting away.
While I waited,
I was wasting away,
hope was wasting away,
faith was wasting away,
I was wasting away.
