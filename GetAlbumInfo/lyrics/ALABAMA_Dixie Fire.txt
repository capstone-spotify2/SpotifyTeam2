I'm not a stranger to passion,
I've seen a lot of love in my time
Felt that physical attraction,
From the touch in the heat of the night
Been all over the country,
Started my share of new flames
But after all is said and done,
There's only one that remains

Dixie fire... burnin' down in my soul
Dixie fire... it never leaves me whole
It took a hometown girl to show me
How cruel these hot summer nights can be
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me
Burning in the heart of me

Searching for some kind of direction,
Looking for a guiding light
Needed to see a lighthouse,
Like a ship on a stormy night
Somehow you heard my music,
You felt the sadness in me
You took the words that were so cold,
And added a warm melody

Dixie fire... burnin' down in my soul
Dixie fire... it never leaves me whole
It took a hometown girl to show me
How cruel these hot summer nights can be
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me
Burning in the heart of me
(Burn it down now)

Burn, burn, burnin'
Burn, burn, burnin' (Can't you see that I'm)
Burn, burn, burnin' (There's a Dixie fire)
Burn, burn, burnin' (Don't you know that I'm)
Burn, burn, burnin'
Burn, burn, burnin'
