Withering time, so elusive
So shapeless
Graceful coul, crumbling glory
It will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times

Time decides what lives or dies
Time can crawl and time can fly
It can wither and erase
It can make a new beginning

There is nothing time can't beat
There is nothing time will need
To destroy and bloom again
A vicious circle older than the earth

Decay, destroy to reform again
Withering time

Withering time, so elusive
So shapeless
Graceful coul, crumbling glory
It will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times

Broken windows, blistering paint
Lashing winds, hot suns and rain wood has splintered, walls are cracked
The elements are just as vicious

All that men have made won't last
In the future as in the past
But our memories are strong
And will out live all circles of time

Time; transcend beyond all life, transcend beyond
On! until the end of time, on and on!
Live! before we waste our time, withering time

Withering time, so elusive
So shapeless
Graceful coul, crumbling glory
It will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times
