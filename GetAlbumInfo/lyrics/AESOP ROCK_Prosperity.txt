Sulking and bulking a half
Sulking a laugh crash test
Figure the mixtures digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftan
The tapwaters on the waters off the waters leaking

So this is blue
my frame reportedly spotted garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
my terms the memoir obligation in the boodoir crystalize impurities to zero on the 
autograph dirty characters sponges hunches hurling murder abundant lunches with the 
city suppers punching (hurdling) tomorrow since I sit in consquence merging brings to 
bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken hi, my name is hazardous 
tobaccanist I'm on the brink I'm purgin dirt and spit my lung in the sink as for the 
product well its drenched in a barren backward wasteland of shimmering moral tension 
and venturing the plaza pleasant I saw it all from pixie dust to crepid pins and 
voodoo dolls and 99 dreams later the shooting gallery wall its like not a wave crash 
similar to last or next heckle me not already doctored by regrets gray rain 
beligerant fragments bomb acid ushering the pixels till the image burned classic 
bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket Ima cast it out to sea and wait for my 
comma to grasp it I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches and I know the rat 
race of the bad taste once his grimmace cringes an iron butterfly will float if given 
good condition but I'm still fisihing the same worm from the same faulty posistion prosperity
I'm tryin to walk alone and miss the bliss inide the accidental meeting of the pencil 
and the ceiling and the censures started meeting breathing at a rappid calibur at 
that a line so gray will last forever more dusting off the dreams to be an autopilot 
still a silent understudy funny how the opposite will throttle and the different 
stroke and model to the prison is innacurate portrayal of an addequate betrayal of a 
wish gonna wanna coulda shoulda woulda did it isnt it amusing choosing and a plan of 
cybernating waiting till the mating means of motivation took a fine posistion dishing 
only after every little kiddy has performed I just wanna be a general he said I just

all picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches to candy land image 
factory sold ah I wanna be an astronaut I got the merits and heart and I bought a 
starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies when they 
raise the lights ja ja ja jesus christ I've never seen so many goblins in my life (oh my lord)
vibrate through the fog and then some dragging bent circuits on a short 
leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs well did you touch that 
slugger banging on the table with an old tin cup thin luck I can raise the dead when 
the shark settlers fled the place brung out they bed of nails to spread the sails 
racing for milk and bread but I got big big plans I ride a big boat with a big ol
