Just cause it feels good...

This is getting tough, sitting here waiting for you,
And I think you've had enough, cause I know it's hard,
This is going on, going on for way too long,
I think you wanna know, I just can't wait

Ooh, I'm trying to find you,
Ooh, I'm trying to reach you girl
I don't even know, just what I want

Ooh, I'm trying to find you,
Ooh, I'm trying to reach you girl
I don't even know, just what I want

Maybe we're just playing house,
Just cause it feels good
Baby we're just playing house,
Just cause it feels good

That don't make it good for anybody,
Don't wanna be in love just with anybody,
I'm tired being just Mr. Anybody,
So baby come with me, let's just make a body
Between us, I need you to see me,
Girl been waiting, please tell me you need it
When you go I will always be there,

Ooh, I'm trying to find you,
Ooh, I'm trying to reach you girl
I don't even know, just what I want

Ooh, I'm trying to find you,
Ooh, I'm trying to reach you girl
I don't even know, just what I want

Maybe we're just playing house,
Just cause it feels good
Just cause it feels good
Just cause it feels good

Just cause it feels good...
Just cause it feels good...
