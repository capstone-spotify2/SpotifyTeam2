She left in a hurry, she wears she'll be back, but I'm kinda worried
Cause I can hear nashville calling her name
I wished her good luck, through the window of a pickup truck
She kissed me goodbye and then she drove away

Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me
On the losing end

That old pickup made up of rust, left me standin in a cloud of dust
And when it settled, it couldn't have been any clearer
I was on the wrong end of the tracks and she wasn't lookin back
Not even a second glance, in her rear-view mirror

Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me

Theres no future in this jukebox town
Singin her songs to me
So she took my heart with her guitar
And drove off to tennessee

Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me
