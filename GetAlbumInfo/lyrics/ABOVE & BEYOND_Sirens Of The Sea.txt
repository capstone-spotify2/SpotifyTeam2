I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call

Take my hand, take my hand, yeah, take my hand
Follow me, follow me, yeah, let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go

Out beyond the water's edge
Far out past the coral ledge
Underneath the diamond dancing lights
Chase the world from far below
Silence sleeping indigo
Drifting out into the endless night

I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call

Take my hand, take my hand, yeah, take my hand
Follow me, follow me, yeah, let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go

Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire to set me free
Let us lie here, all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea 

I can not resist your call
