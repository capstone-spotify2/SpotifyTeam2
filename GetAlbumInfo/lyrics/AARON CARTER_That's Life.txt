I come from a bottom of hate but I made it
Iâve been dead broke and Iâve been famous, yeah
Iâm not afraid to get dirty
Iâve seen concrete grown roses

But you know itâs not an easy life
Yeah we all get a second try
And it donât matter what you have
Or the cars you drive
Itâs gonna be a crazy ride

You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud thereâs a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know

Letâs be blind to all the colours
âcause weâre all sisters and brothers
We are, weâre all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
Itâs alright
Yeah thatâs life

Yeah my 99 problems ainât gonâ stop me
I got air to breathe and my heartbeat and you can
Try to hold me down
I know exactly who Iâm gonna be

<i>[?]</i> where life can <i>[?]</i>
But that donât mean that no one loves ya
You know you gotta keep your head up
Yeah you gotta keep your head up

You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud thereâs a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know

Letâs be blind to all the colours
âcause weâre all sisters and brothers
We are, weâre all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
Itâs alright
Yeah thatâs life

Letâs be blind to all the colours
âcause weâre all sisters and brothers
We are, weâre all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
Itâs alright
Yeah thatâs life
