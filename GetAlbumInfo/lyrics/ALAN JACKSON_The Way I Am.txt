Wish I were down, on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am

Wish I enjoyed, what makes my living
And what I do, with a willing hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am

Yeah, I just dream, and keep on being the way I am.

Yoo da lay eee..  Yoo da lay eee...
