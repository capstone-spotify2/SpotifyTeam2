<i>[English Translation:]</i>

I was out of it because of your gentleness
Because of your sweetness, because of your lies

My dream changed â instead of a famous singer
I tried to become a good wife
I was such a fool, I was such a fool

My singing got better after breaking up with you
After living crazily with music, all of the song lyrics
Seemed like my story so I sang them to death
Little by little, slowly, my tears dried

I couldnât see ahead, it was so hard
I cursed a lot and ruined my insides from drinking

Itâs all over now, after I losing you
I earned a bigger hope
Itâs really really so fortunate, itâs really so fortunate

My singing got better after breaking up with you
After living crazily with music, all of the song lyrics
Seemed like my story so I sang them to death
Little by little, slowly, my tears dried

Some day, you will probably call me
Then I hope you will be a man and congratulate me

Because this is all thanks to you
Iâll prepare a good thank you message for you

My singing got better after breaking up with you
After living crazily with music, all of the song lyrics
Seemed like my story so I sang them to death
Little by little, slowly, my tears dried
Slowly, I got over you like that
