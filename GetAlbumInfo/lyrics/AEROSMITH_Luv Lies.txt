ahh when you cross that line that you know you cant erase
to fall in lust not love aint no sin at all
and tell me when your with your bestfriends friend do you still feel out of place
no thanks I took that ride 
God only knows I tried believing
I imagine everyone sometimes would cross their heart &amp; hope to die
to tell I love you lies
I imagine everyone survives for giving up all that you got to tell I love you lies

the first time you look for love you find you dont know jack
yeah so much for my ? you play to win
cause first you lose your hearts desire then you get it back but in ???
place theres so much more behind the kiss I'm feeling

I imagine everyone sometimes will cross their heart &amp; hope to die to tell I love you lies
I imagine everyone survives for giving up all that you got to tell I love 
you lies

When lonliness &amp; paranoia feeds me
god help the person who needs me
If ignorance is bliss than take me off the list I'm needing

I imagine everyone sometimes will cross their heart &amp; hope to die to tell I love you lies
I imagine everyone survives for giving up all that you got to tell I love you lies
