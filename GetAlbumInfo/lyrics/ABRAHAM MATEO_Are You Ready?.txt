Feel so alive
I'm lost in your eyes, in your eyes
Play sweet love songs
This all nigh long, all night long

Are you ready for a big day, day?
I'm ready now to hearing you scream my name
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,

Hard, scape a peak
So hard to breathe, so hard to breathe
So much fun for you and me
Turn up the bass, turn up the bass

Are you ready for a big day, day?
I'm ready now to hearing you scream my name
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,

Runaway, runaway
I'm with you
Runaway, no feel
Break away, Break away

I'm with you
Break away, no feel

Are you ready for a big day, day?
I'm ready now to hearing you scream my name
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
Are you ready for a big day, day?
I'm ready now to hearing you scream my name
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,
Are you ready for a new day, new day?
You gotta me going crazy so crazy tonight,
Feel so alive
