Lyin' beside you watching you sleepin'
After you've loved me so tenderly
I'm searchin' for some way to tell you
How good it felt when I held you
There's so many ways you get to me.

'Cause you've got the touch
It turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps burning strong
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
You move me so much
You've got the touch.

As you wake up you pull me closer
And whisper good morning warm in my ear
Nobody could do that like you do
You make it so easy to love you
And I know I will for a million years.

'Cause you've got the touch
You turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps growing strong
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
That move me so much
You've got the touch.

Nobody can touch me like you do
You make it so ease to love you
And I know I will a million years.

'Cause you've got the touch
You turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps growing strong...
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
That move me so much
You've got the touch

You've got the moves
That move so much
You've got the touch
