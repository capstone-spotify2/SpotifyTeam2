You're my world
The shelter from the rain
You're the pills
Then take away my pain
You're the light
That helps me find my way
You're the words
When I have nothing to say

In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
I'm Still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you

You're the fire
That warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold
as I grow old.
You're the shore
When I am lost at sea
You're the only thing
That I like about me.

In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
I'm still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you

How long has it been
Since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends
And goes like this forever

In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
