I never thought I was strong enough
To handle raising my own son
You'll always fear what you've never done
I hope he'll know me when I come home

Nothing gonna change
My love for you

I love my child
He's got his mother's smile
I'm so fortunate so fortunate
Life can get tight
But I will make it right
I'm so fortunate so fortunate

I had to learn what meant more to me
My family's became everything
I miss you more than you'll ever know
I wish that I could just leave go home
