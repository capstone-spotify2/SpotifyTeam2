Awaken ruinous fiend of early generations.
Your rotting corpse is restored.
Straighten your limbs brush off the dust withered bandages restrain you no more.
Severed heads accent the gates bones emerge from the sands proof of your reign remains.
I your  liege now command your rule again.
The sun burns through the skin boiling your vital organs within.
But the gods can't destroy my cursed blackened heart.
Appeasing the thirst of the damned mocking the praised ones.
The sand soaks the blood  the blood flows like wine send death from above.
Locusts and famine engulfing your race my savagery knows no end.
At the price of all your lives I destroy your kind death by my hand.
Sands blowing across cursed lands will consume the evidence of your ancient existence.
The Earth is now black from the torment I have set upon it.
All shall bow serve and praise thy name.
