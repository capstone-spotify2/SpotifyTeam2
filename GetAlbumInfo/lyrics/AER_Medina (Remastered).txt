Iâve been sippingâ on the, sippinâ on the, sippinâ on the
Iâve been sipping on the..

When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey

Walking through the field
Into, the textures on my hand are sliding, flowing, through
The sounds are growing yeah
Iâve been locked up for days
The nature and the sky, make me wanna breathe
(When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey)

Iâve been sipping on the sand darling
Iâve been sipping on the sand darling
Iâve been sipping on the sand oh yea, oh-oh
Iâve been sipping on the sand darling
Iâve been sipping on the sand darling

Iâve been sipping on the sand darling
Iâve been writing with my hands all night

When I come around
I see the clouds are grey
The light, keeps me up high, floating away,
If the sun shines, off my eyes
I fall to my feet
The skies, are a clear blue, my blindfold to grey

To grey, to grey, to grey..
