<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Shilo... ? Is your name Shilo?
Can I talk to you?
Can you come down please... 
So we can speak?
I saw you at the show
I thought I'd seen a ghost
Your resemblance is striking
You have your mother's eyes, 
Her hair
I was told you died with her
All these years have come and gone
How do I put this... ?
I'm your Godmom.

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
State your business... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Business?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
What do you want?

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
I want, I want to finally meet you
Something real to cling to
Leave you with the hope that
You will go do all you're meant to, 
All I've failed to
In you, is a world of promise
We have both been kept in bondage, 
But you can learn from all my failures... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Or let them through the gate?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
That either... a big risk... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
A big fence... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
A mistake... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
A new friend... 

<i>[Nancy Long:]</i>
Chase the morning... 
Yield for nothing... 
Chase the morning... 
Yield for nothing... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
How'd you do that?

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Do what?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Do that... 
That, that eye thing... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
These eyes can do more than see... 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
I know I mean, I've seen you sing

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Where?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
From my window
I can see the world from there
Name the stars and constellations
Count the cars and watch the seasons

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
I wish we could've watched together

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
I can't have guests

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Never?

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
Ever
If Dad found out
That I'd been let out, 
Or you'd been let in... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
I should go then
Before I do, promise me you won't 

<i>[Alexa Vega:]</i>
It's better that you-

Don't
Forget me
'Best if I resume my life inside
My bedroom

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Don't forget that
A sheltered rose needs a little
Room to bloom outside her bedroom

<i>[Nancy Long:]</i>
Chase the morning... 
Yield for nothing... 
Chase the morning... 
Yield for nothing... 

<i>[Sarah Brightman:]</i>
Let your life be your dream
Integrity
Honesty
It's too late for me... 
Don't look back 'til you're free to
Chase the morning... 

<i>[Nancy Long:]</i>
Yield for nothing... 
Chase the morning... 
Yield for nothing... 

Yield for nothing...
