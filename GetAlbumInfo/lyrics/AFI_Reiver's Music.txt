I gave up fighting.
I've come to see these halos.
Am I now worse off for this one night?

All come enchanted, welcomed by the halos.
All the while we know those enamored never miss us because we are all now in dying days, hear nothing and see no one.
Nothing is all we own.

I've taken to speaking words that only they know.
How soon I did see, all here is unseen.

I gave up trying.
I've come to be these halos and welcome to our show those enamored who won't miss us because we are all now in dying days,
hear nothing and see no one.
Nothing is all we own.

With only echoes proving that I'm here with all the wraiths, for all these years and I have no desire to leave.

Because we are all now in dying days, hear nothing and see no one.
Nothing is all we own.
