Before I fly, and wave goodbye. I'll say to you.
Days with you, are the best years of my life.
But if I don't see you anymore,
Keep my words safely stored.
And I'll be back I promise, Once more.

Goodbye, goodbye, Till I see you again.
Goodbye, goodbye, I'll love and I'll miss you.
Till then, remember me, 'cause I care.
Where you are, and how you feel.
Get in touch with me, golden your face.
I guess its been to much fun,
We've shared, and we've won.
Yes the best, is yet to come.

Goodbye, goodbye, Till I see you again.
Goodbye, goodbye, I'll love, and I'll miss you.
Till then, That one word hurts so bad.
You leave the best you've had.
But you keep the faith and pray to return.

Goodbye, goodbye, I'll love and I'll miss you.
Till then, goodbye, goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye...
