You struck me like a bolt of lightening
Running through me in the dead of night and I know it
I know it.
Now I see you when I close my eyes you're
the only reason why I live and die, and I know it
I know it.

And I feel you down in my soul
You rattle my bones
It's running me over and over
And I feel you burning my heart
It rattles my bones
You're running me over and over...

Light me up in a burning fire
See the smoke written in the sky that I know it
I know it.
And I'm never gonna try to fight it
You're the reason why I live and die and I know it,
I know it.

And I feel you down in my soul
You rattle my bones
It's running me over and over
And I feel you burning my heart
It rattles my bones
You're running me over and over...

Oh you're running me over, you're running me over, you're running me over woahhh.

You're runnin' me over, you're runnin' me over you're runnin' me over..
You're runnin' me runnin' me, runnin' me runnin' me, running me over and over
You're running me over! You're running me over! You're running me over and over!
And I feel you down in my soul.
You rattle my bones.
It's running me over and over...

And I feel you down in my soul
You rattle my bones
It's running me over and over
And I feel you burning my heart
It rattles my bones
You're running me over and over...

You rattle my bones
Woah
