Cold and wired
I've been fired
Everything you said to me goes well
Everything you said that you said
Said you're seeing right through me
Could be pulling you to me
Nothing seems to be working
Throwing all my intentions on the, on the....

All tied in one
Honesty waits here forever
I've been undone
Glory and us come together

Beautiful is my picture
Throw it up in the spotlight
The setting seems to be working
Throwing all my intentions on the, on the...

All tied in one
Honesty waits here forever
I've been undone
Glory and us come together

And I'll see this through
Everything you said before
And I'll see this through

All tied in one
All tied in one

Everything changes the colours we see (All tied in one)
Constant reminder of all that we should
Taking it back (All tied in one)
Turning around, turning around (Glory and us come to...)
Everything changes the colours we see (All tied in one)
Constant reminder of all that we should (Honesty waits here forever)
Turning around, turning around (I've been undone)
Glory is waiting
