Well...
Northern Georgia, highway 41,
Beside the carpet mill and the gas station
There was a music store, slash radio shack
With the sound of dreamers jamming in the back

Well we rocked all night and we rolled all day
We never bought nothin' but we sure did play
The music was loud and the girls were pretty
There was always some magic down at Pete's Music City

We had electric guitars just a gatherin' dust
And a chrome mic stand with just a little bit of rust
And a couple of amps with the volume on 10
When the last bell rings that's when the music begins

And we rocked all night...
And we rolled all day
We never bought nothin' but we sure did play
The music was loud and the girls were pretty
There was always some magic down at Pete's music city

Well the years have been long, and they ain't been kind
And they say all that's left is the old faded sign
But the music's still ringing loud in my heart
Down at Pete's Music City where I got my start

Well we rocked all night...
And we rolled all day
We never bought nothin' but we sure did play
The music was loud and the girls were pretty
There was always some magic down at Pete's Music City
We rocked all night and we rolled all day
We never bought nothin' but we sure did play
The music was loud and the girls were pretty
There was always some magic down at Pete's Music City
