Let's go take a ride in your car
I will take the passenger seat
Baby, we don't have to go far
Unless you wanna show
Me a lovely place out of town
Where you feel most at ease
Well you are the one that I like
Always will be

I think it's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
One single touch from you, I'm gone
Still got the rush when I'm alone
I think it is time I let you know
Take all of me, I will devote
You set me free, my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved

I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take take take take over control
Oh oh oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take take take take over control
Oh oh oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take take take take over control
Oh oh oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

Baby, baby, can't you see?
That I'm giving all of me
So, it's up to you now
We could let time pass away
I'll make an excuse to play
But, it's up to you now
Just wanna fulfill your needs
While you're taking over me
So, what do you want now?
Take a picture, make a show
'Cause nobody has to know
All the ways that we get down

I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take take take take over control
Oh oh oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

Oh, oh whoa oh
Oh, oh whoa ooh oh
Plug it in and turn me on

Oh, oh whoa oh
Oh, oh whoa ooh oh
Plug it in and turn me on

Oh, oh whoa oh
Oh, oh whoa ooh oh

Oh, oh whoa oh
Oh, oh whoa ooh oh
Plug it in and turn me on
(On, on, on, on, on...)

Plug it in and turn me on
(On, on, on, on, on...)
