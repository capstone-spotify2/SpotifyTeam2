I'm tired of fighting, got a fever when you try to get out. (Out, out, out) 
I've tried but I can't understand what all the fuss is about. 
I wish that I could be the man that you wanted me to be. 
I need you to see. 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I try and I try, yet I can't seem to fly. 
My soul full of pain when you cry, I wish I was perfect and god knows I try. 
But everything I do just tears your heart in two, I wonder why.

I never thought that being lovers meant that we can't be friends
If only I could understand what make you stay and stop breaking free from me
I wonder why.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Can't you see 
It's killing me, it's not the way things used to be. 
Can you remember yesterday, we used to smile without a care
Whenever you and I were near
Can't you see that I wanna be with you.

Oh baby! 

Oh oh oh, everything I do, tears your heart in two.
<i>[Chorus: Repeat Till End]</i>
