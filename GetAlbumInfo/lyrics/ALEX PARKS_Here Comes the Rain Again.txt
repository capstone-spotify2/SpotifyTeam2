Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do

Oh, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do, oh

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

Ooh, I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Won't you walk with me
Like lovers do

Oh, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do, oh

Here comes the rain again
Raining on my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Won't you walk with me
Like lovers do

Oh, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do, oh

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
