Do me a favor, with that, light the candle. Is that the Hawaiian Rayman? 
Aight I get the same one every single time, I don't understand this

At the piano with a glass of pino
All red silk like I'm nino
Custom made shit, I weight 140 kilos
Sneeze on 100G's, hoes on their knees blow from Montego
The way my hair look you swear my name was Rodrigo
Lay low, if you can't do it then just say no
If you ain't built to play this game then you get halo'd
I put a lot of fiends in k-holes

Hello
Hi
What's up mama?
I just watched *boing* perform
How do you feel about it?
They ain't you baby hahaha, you're better than all these shit heads

I'm just a bastard with a bad habit
Bad back in a black Volkswagen Rabbit
Shit I gotta have it
Black magic woman put a spell on me
Fuck around and win a spelling bee
I could walk under ladders, still won the lotto
Ten minutes flat, built a boat in a bottle
Roy Rodgers baffle, sniffin' coke with a model
Told her to Google me, shit I might paint the Cougar green
All this lechuga in my jeans
I still see Freddy Kruger in my dreams
Ain't nothin' moving but the cream
Shit, know I do it for team

I just wanna hear em announce your name, that's all I care about
How's your knee?
My knee is... It's not bad these past few days
You been alright?

That's all I care about
Took a meeting up at Paramount
Typecast as a romantic lead
I'm classically trained for drug dealing
But I wasn't good at drug dealing
So I flipped shit, rug, ceiling
Dry water, five daughters all stood 5'4"
Or got 5 quarters for the store


Fuck knows what I'm saying anymore mane, my mind is shot, been working so motherfuckin' hard. 
So I'm bout to light this motherfuckin' dab up. Til the next time, peace
