Drop like the needle
Today I felt the drain
Iâll climb back up to you
On ladders of the rain

Break them down, shake up their beliefs
Iâll show them, show them a believer
300,000 amps
And Iâm your warm receiver

When they kill the lights
Youâll remain my conductor
And if they didnât drain your life
Iâll become your conductor
Donât cut the connection

Bleed in to black clouds
And I will lick them clean
Turn to a tourniquet
And cinch yourself to me

Strike down now, shake their frail beliefs
And make them new born believers
300,000 amps
And Iâm your warm receiver

When they kill the lights
Youâll remain my conductor
And if they didnât drain your life
Iâll become your conductor

When they kill the lights
Youâll remain my conductor
Youâll remain my conductor
Youâll remain my conductor
