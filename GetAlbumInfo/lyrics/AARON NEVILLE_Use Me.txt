Well, my friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
But my answer to all that use me stuff
Is that I, I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

But my brother
You know he sit me right down and he talked to me
Well, he told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me
But I'm sure he meant well
You know, but when our talk was through
I had to say, now brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
Whoa, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

But sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me
Well, you get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you act real rude to me
But, oh baby, baby, baby, baby
When you love me, I can't get enough
And I, said I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

Talkin' 'bout you using me
And It all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me
Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do
Until you use me up

Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Baby, just a keep on using
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Baby....
Until you use me up
Get funky....
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
