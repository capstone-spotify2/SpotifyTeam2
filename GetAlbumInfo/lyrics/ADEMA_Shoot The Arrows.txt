Been greeted with a smile,
In my back twists the knife,
So quick to flip the switch,
Never know quite what hit,
Behind lines you know,
True colors always show,
Forget that you exist,
The hand that feeds cut off at the wrist.

Hate spreads like infection,
Two faces yet you see one.

Hey, shoot the arrows,
As I turn and go,
Know one day when most of us are gone,
Shoot the arrows,
Holding on to what you feel is true,
And it's killing you.

Fed up for so long,
I've let go,
Watch you hang on,
When did lost trust begin,
As soon as I decide to let you in,
This took a part of me,
That will never return you see,
I've grown cold and hollow,
The hurt that's caused I'll never let it show.

Total lack of devotion,
In you I have no faith.

Hey, shoot the arrows,
As I turn and go,
Know one day when most of us are gone,
Shoot the arrows,
Holding on to what you feel is true,
And it's killing you.

There's no way that you ever could have known,
I would stoop so low,
Don't tell me you wouldn't do the same thing,
And I know all the things you play,
Think hard 'cause now it starts to eat you,
There's nothing else to do,
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE,
You hold on to what you feel is true,
And now it's killing you.

Know one day when most of us are gone,
Shoot the arrows,
Holding on to what you feel is true,
And it's killing you,
Hey, shoot the arrows,
As I turn and go
