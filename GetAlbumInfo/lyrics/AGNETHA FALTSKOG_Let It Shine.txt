There's a star up above the horizon
And it's shining for you and me
Something tells me this was meant to be,
Do you feel like a dance in the moonlight,
Is your heart beating crazy like mine?
You've got something burning bright
Don't keep it locked inside.

Let it shine, show me your light
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me.

Don't you wish you could live every moment
Like that moment's the best one you'll see?
That's the way the world is supposed to be,
When you find someone you can believe in
Letting go is the easy part,
Just close your eyes and take a breath
And open up your heart.

Let it shine, show me your light
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me.

Everyone puts in their time alone in the dark,
Reach out and you're gonna find
The very best part of who you are.

Let it shine, show me your light
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me.

Let it shine, ohh...show me your light
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me.

Let it shine, ohh...won't you let it shine?
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me....
