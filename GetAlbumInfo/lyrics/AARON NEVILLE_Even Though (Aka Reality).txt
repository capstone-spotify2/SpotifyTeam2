Even though we're apart you're still right here in my heart 
Your hands are still in mine, I can still hear you whispering words divine 

I can feel your warm embrace, just the thought of it puts a smile upon my face 
But my imagination, whoa I said it's so strong, but reality keep assuring me I'm all alone 

But now from my lips comes a song, with tears in my eyes, 
Cuz now you're gone, so all your sweet talk........ 
Even though we're apart, you're still right here in my heart 
My imagination, Oh I said it's so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone 

My imagination, Oh so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone
