Let me tell you what I told you
Long before I noticed love is real, yes
Say something
Don't sit there, say nothing

I will try to explain it to you
It's glory, Alleluia, this love is real
Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen

'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded

I will try to break it down, release it to be found
This love is real, yeah
Won't you clap your hands?
Somebody say, amen

Hey, we can fill it up
And feel our love then come to us
Love is real, yeah, say it aloud
Sit down, say nothing

Trying to be real, not trying to fool ya
Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky

We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real
Say something
Don't sit down say nothing, no

These feelings make you wanna want some
Feeling make you wanna want some
Hey, makes you clap your hands, son
Makes you clap your hands, son

I wish I could have
Something to say this evening
I gotta have
Something to say this evening

I'd say one Sunday evening
Somebody came knocking at my door
Knocking at my door, open the door and let him in
Was a feeling, oh, oh, feeling, hey

Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me lost, ah, just a squeeze

Oh, mug around the house
Talking about going someplace
One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much

I might even go into New York city
But never had an idea
That I wanna go to heaven
And I wanna go to heaven

I wanna go, I feel pretty good
I wanna go to <i>[?]</i>
I feel pretty good, yeah
I feel like, I feel like I wanna, huh

That's a note
Hey, this love is real, this love is real
Hey, this love is real
Hey, they wanna love is real

This love is real
So real, so real, so real
Love is real, this love is real, yes, it's real
This love is real
