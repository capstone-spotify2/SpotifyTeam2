Stagecoach lady, hourglass body
Makin' things glow in the night
Well, she would if she could
And she'd be good if she would 
Only tell her lover she'd be out tonight

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that

Salt Lake City, salt-lickin' bitties
Bogies turn, stinkin' of gin
Well my daddy was hard
His face was pretty scarred
From kickin' ass to playin' poker to win

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that
It's too bad

It's too bad
Can't get me none of that

New sold lady
My mama Cady
Chivalry was born at her feet
Well she should have thought twice
When pa showed his dice
Imagine puttin' my daddy to sleep

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that

It's too bad
Lord, it's too bad
I said it's too bad
Lord, it's too bad
I said It's too bad 
It's too bad
You know it's too bad
It's too bad
