Don't let hurricane
Hold you back
Raging rivers and shark attack

Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away

Wrestle bears
Bring them to their knees
Steal the honey from the
Killer bees and

Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away

Don't be scared
To connect the dots
Dig for gold
In the parking lot and

Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away
