She was beautiful, on my best day I was average.
She was a goddess and I didn't have a prayer.
So how does a boy like me get through to a girl like her, way up there?
I've got a good chance of never getting her attention.
An even better chance that she'll walk right by.
I need to make a plan, try something new thats bullet proof,
to catch her eye.

Do I need to ride a bull in the rodeo?
Fly like superman? Walk on a tight rope?
Is that what she needs for her to see me?
Live a little dangerous?
Be outrageous? Act like a fool?
Learn to play this person I can't be?
Well maybe baby, could i just be me?

I bet she'd like me if she only knew me.
It's a long shot, thats all I got.
I guess I better jump in, sink or swim, so here i go.
Ready or not..

The way I am where we could be best friends.
If she could only understand...

That I wanna ride a bull in the rodeo.
Fly like superman, walk on a tight rope,
if thats what she needs for her to see me.
Rope the moon, maybe catch her a star.
Anything on earth to win her heart.
I'd do most anything..
But maybe baby, i could just be me.

Woah, woah

I could just be me
Yeah, yeah
Could I just be me?
