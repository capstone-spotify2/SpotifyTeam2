No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
No mercy from me
Tell no truth an' tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
If you inject your venom
It'll be your last attack

No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
V.e.n.o.m.

Got no heart, no feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain
Come choose your victim
Take him by surprise
Go in hard and get him
Right between the eyes and
Inject the venom
Inject the venom, c'mon
Inject the venom
Inject it all
Stick it in
Stick it

Inject the venom
Inject the venom

Inject the venom
Get it all
Inject the venom
Inject the venom
Inject it all

Inject the venom
