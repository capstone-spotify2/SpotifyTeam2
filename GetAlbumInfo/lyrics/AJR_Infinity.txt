Was it all in my head?
In an empty bed
And I told you that I need you baby
Can't you see I'm alone oh oh?
I was lost in my feet
On an empty street
So I save your seat infinity
You forever figures 5 and 3
You know oh oh

Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
My momma says to pick the best
And you are it

HEY!

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should've been
Oh my lady can I have this dance?

My lady

HEY!

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began

Was it hard to believe?
Wear your heart on my sleeve
And I'll hold you when you're lonely
When you're cold cause you're the only girl for me

Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My momma says to pick the best
And you are it

HEY!

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should've been
Oh my lady can I have this dance?
My lady

HEY!

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began

Hey

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again, like we should've been

Oh my lady, can I have this dance?

HEY

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again, like we should've been

Oh my lady can I have this dance?

HEY

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began

Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My momma said to pick the best

And you are it
