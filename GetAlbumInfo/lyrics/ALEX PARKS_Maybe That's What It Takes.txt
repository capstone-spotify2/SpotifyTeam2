Looking back, how did I get here?
Chasing circles, never thought so near
I'm shaded by the red, now I want you

I walk this way in my dreams softly
Far way, your distant light's on me
I'm shaded by the red

Maybe that's what it takes
For me to be with you
Maybe it's our love saved

Maybe that's why it breaks
And we do the things we do
Maybe that's what it takes

I've opened up, I've let you back inside
Don't take your time 'cause I will wish I'd lied
I'll shame you with the red

Maybe that's what it takes
For me to be with you
Maybe it's our love saved

Maybe that's why it breaks
And we do the things we do
Maybe that's what it

How will I know to call?
How will I know if you're the one
The one, the only one

Maybe that's what it takes
For me to be with you
Maybe we have to wait

Maybe that's what it takes
For me to be with you
Maybe it's our love saved

Maybe that's why it breaks
And we do the things we do
Maybe that's what it takes
Maybe that's what it takes
