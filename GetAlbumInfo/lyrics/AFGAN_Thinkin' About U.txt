In the dark room 
Rain at the window 
Lights turned down low 
The TV's on 
But I'm not really watching 
Just stare at the glow

I could really do without all these emotions 
But they're running over 
Every minute that I try to hold them back 
They keep getting stronger 

Thinking about you 
I hope that your laying 
With thoughts of me too 
I find it so hard to 
Resist the desire 
Burning for you 

Thought this feeling would fade out 
Just a matter of time 
But all I see is something that I can't deny 
I can't help the way feel 
Wish you'd give me a sign 
I don't want to wait forever 
Cause the moment that I try to reach the answer 
It keeps getting further, baby
All the words that I say don't come out right 
But I still mean them 

Thinking about you 
I hope that your laying 
With thoughts of me too 
I find it so hard to 
Resist the desire 
Burning for you 

Thinking about you 
I hope that your laying 
With thoughts of me too 
I find it so hard to 
Resist the desire 
Burning for you 

Whichever road you take I will be there won't you realize 
That every second wasted it takes us longer to get to 
Paradise 
Paradise... 

Thinking about you 
I hope that your laying 
With thoughts of me too 
I find it so hard to 
Resist the desire 
Burning for you 
For you 
For you...
