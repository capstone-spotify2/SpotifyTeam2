I came upon two strangers on a black and white TV
In a hotel room called nowhere, in the dead of half-past three
Their eyes met across the captain's table
Both trying to resist, but just weren't able
The one that got away.

You knew it had to happen, the music grew intense
In love affairs on oceans, the feelings seem immense
Looks like they headed into stormy weather
Oh, they saw it, even though they stuck together
The one that got away

Now he sees past the glamour, she sees past the lies
The night is quick to anger, the dawn is slow to rise
Who knows what the powers are that divide us?
She still keeps a photograph beside her
The one that got away
The one that got away
