I'm walking tard somewhere tonight
So far, my heart is open wide
Fire, frozen, boxes, broken
I don't care, I swear I

I'm on top of the world
Kicking up with the boys, but I'm free
I'm on top of the world
Getting drunk with the love inside of me
I'm on top of the world
All I know is if I go, go go
Until I can't no more, more, more
I'll be on top of the world
On top of the world
We'll see

I'm hailing down this starry night
You can wanna come stand here by my side
Fire, frozen, boxes, broken
I don't care, I swear I

I'm on top of the world
Kicking up with the boys, but I'm free
I'm on top of the world
Getting drunk with the love inside of me
I'm on top of the world
All I know is if I go, go go
Until I can't no more, more, more
I'll be on top of the world
On top of the world
We'll see

We could be up here forever
Long as we do this together
We could be up here forever
Long as we do this together
We could be up here forever
Long as we do this together
We could be up here forever
Long as we do this together

I'm on top of the world
Kicking up with the boys, but I'm free
I'm on top of the world
Getting drunk with the love inside of me
I'm on top of the world
All I know is if I go, go go
Until I can't no more, more, more
I'll be on top of the world
On top of the world
We'll see
