One million a. d.
There'll be you there'll be me
Rocky's dead
That's rocky 1003
Red stars and stripes
One big team
With little europe
In between

U. s. s. a.
U. s. s. a.
U. s. s.
What you want is what you get now
U. s. s. a.
U. s. s. a.
U. s. s.
Rearrange the alphabet

One million a. d.

We get on happily
Rocky's dead
That's a real tragedy
Synthesizers made us slaves
So we smashed them up
To decorate our caves

Look out 'cos armageddon's gonna rock you
He got plans for you and me
Look out for armageddon on the goodship
Faith, hope, and anarchy

One million a. d.
We don't dig history
We killed the gonk
To avenge rocky
We've archive footage
How it all began
The film was called
How the west was won
Move over
