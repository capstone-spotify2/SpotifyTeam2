Five pretty boys for ten shitty years
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
I need a reaction, a new revolution
All over the country, 'cos they took it away 

They took it away, it can't be impossible
They're playing the records that they play in hospital
Radio playlist for the terminally ill
You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 

If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 

They took it away, left us with nothing
Second-hand hits and million misses
Nobody means it, they're making up stories
You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 

I blame myself, I want an easy life
Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 

If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 

They took it away, left us with nothing

You suffer the pain of your fingers burning

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 

If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away
