Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over fields we go, laughing all the way
(Laughing all the way)

Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
Ohh,  what fun it is to laugh
And sing a sleigh song tonight

Ohh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, yeah
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
What's on?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Ohh, what fun, ohh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

In a one horse open sleigh
In a one horse open sleigh
In a one horse open sleigh
One horse open sleigh
