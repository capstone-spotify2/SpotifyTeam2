With everything
That has occured
Within a year

Sometimes I feel like
Something has to give
Cause I know this world
Is not as safe as it appears

So I wanna make a better place to live

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
We all tryna find a better place to live
I could paint a landscape with music that I give
Paint a world full of peace, love and happiness
First I gotta live in it
Before I hand you all the script
Lost a couple legends last year
Moment of silence
Bowie in the skies
I hope he routing for my shit
Carrie you a Queen
Been crushing since I was 5 and
I'll fight with the rebels
Till force is restored to my ship
Media a dark cloud over me
These days never know
What to believe
Cause everybody talks
No one ever leads
Cause everybody looks
No one ever sees
Finding out that freedom ain't free
Fighting in the streets
We got drones over seas
We got cracks in the system
And they started showing up
And the news is in cahoots
While they tryna cover up, fuck

I don't mean to make shit bleed
But to make change
Gotta know the problem underneath

Spread love in our homes
Let it flow into the streets

Screaming on the hill side
Let it echo to the peaks

Let 'em know
That we won't rest without peace
Though too many had to go
To expose this breach

If not for us
Then for generations to come
Though we've had dark days
Hope rising up like the sun

I'm a ride for the change
I'm a fight for the love

Sat down to write this
And I laced up my gloves
And I step in the ring
Put the world on my back

Steady throwin' punches
Till it's all in the past

Tryna kill a couple words
Like hate, ignorance out
Send a knockout to the words
That really taking us down

I believe in the people
I don't believe in the wedge
They tryna drive inbetween us
That ain't what it really is
