<i>[Chorus:]</i>
People get ready
There's a train coming
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all
If you'll just love the Lord

There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind
Just to save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances grow thinner
There's no hiding place
Around the kingdon's throne

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
People get ready
There's a train coming
Don't need no ticket
You just get on board
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord
