Wakin' up on monday mornin'
Sunday'd been and gone
Reachin' out for you
But I was alone

Now I sit at the breakfast table
Table's set for two
Been the same thing ev'ry morning
Silly things I do

Ooh, don't know what to do about you
I'll never could give the way you gave
Ooh, now should I try to find you
Keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
Feel like breakin' up again

It's a thing I gotta live with
Take it on my own
I'm waitin' till it's over
Then again I never know

If I'd only seen you goin'
Walkin' out the door
But I had no way of knowin'
Can't take it no more

Ooh, don't know what to do about you
I'll never could give the way you gave
Ooh, now should I try to find you
Keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
Feel like breakin' up again
