I watched the city lights go up in Glasgow
And I thought about the stupid things we said the night before
There were so many words I had to say
So I wrote 'till I just couldn't write no more

I knew that come tomorrow, I'd be leaving
And I didn't want to bring it up because I'd miss you all
There were so many things I could regret
So I'll think 'till I just can't think no more

Here comes another night of trying to forget what I won't remember
And I can't move forward 'till I push you back

I won't stop 'till I make it back to you
But I need time to find out what I want from you
And when I clear these voices in my head
I'll hear what you've been saying and we'll sleep under the stars

I'm told that people like to call us dreamers
Because we won't ever stop until we've done all we can do
There are so many things I haven't seen
So I'll look 'till I just can't look no more

And if I told you everything I wanted
Would you close your eyes or look away or say you didn't hear
There are so many things I need from you
So I'll sing 'till I just can't sing no more

I won't stop 'till I make it back to you
But I need time to find out what I want from you
And when I clear these voices in my head
I'll hear what you've been saying and we'll sleep under the stars

Sat under this tree with you, the rain is on our faces
And I can't think of a single place where I would rather be

Don't forget, if you ever need me, I'm only a vodka away from you
Don't forget there's nothing you could say,
Nothing you can say that's any use to me
Don't forget, if you ever need me, I'm only a vodka away from you
Don't forget there's nothing you could say,
Nothing you can say that's any use to me
