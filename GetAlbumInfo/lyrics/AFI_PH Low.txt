So quickly draining away. 
If you could only hear all the things you used to say. 
Consumed now by what you knew
was poisonous, quenching your thirst for life (for life.) 
Will you die for me? 
Will you live for me? 
Kill aspirations away.
Embrace a dream that was a nightmare only yesterday. 
True friends forgotten and all hopes been traded in, 
exchanged for what.
For what? 
All at once, all is lost.
All is lost.
