There's an open sky and an empty city
Where the rain falls of the night.
Upon precious flames, we once found so pretty
Our frail and only light.

Love is all that's left,
And I'm emotionless.

You won't read it in the papers
In this time.
Keep your hands clean
Just read my mind.

We're trapped between the nightmares,
And I fear
The future's here it's 1985,
It's 1985.

Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
Oh...

All the emptiness overfills this city
So you'll be queen tonight.
As you overthrow looking pale and pretty
I welcome your requite.

They told us love can save,
So we prepared our graves.

You won't read it in the papers
In this time.
Keep your hands clean
Just read my mind.

We're trapped between the nightmares
And I fear
The future's here it's 1985,
It's 1985.
Can you read my mind?

Will you hold my hand as we count the hours?
The hours?
Will you hold my hand as we count down the hours?
The hours?

Standing beneath the meteor showers.
Oh!

You won't read it in the papers
In this time.
Keep your hands clean
Just read my mind.

We're trapped between the nightmares,
And I fear
The future's here it's 1985,
It's 1985.
Can you read my mind?
