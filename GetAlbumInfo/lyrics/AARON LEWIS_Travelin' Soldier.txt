Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth, in a cafe there
He gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me, I'm feelin' a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Afghanistan
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things that he was so scared of

He said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said "Folks, would you bow your head
To a list of local soldiers dead"

Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But the pretty little girl, with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin'...

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home
