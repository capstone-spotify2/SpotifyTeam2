Her daddy's knockin at the bedroom door 
Cocked and loaded with a .44 
I got one in the hand and two in the bush 
I'm in no mans land and it's a hell of a rush 

I got just one wood six holes to play 
Things ain't fair no, on this fairway 

What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me 

Mama's in the kitchen swingin' a date 
With a new milkman and his best friend's mate 
The house is rockin' to the ground 
Her daddy ain't happy no he's missin' out 

I got just one wood six holes to play 
Things ain't fair no, on this fairway 

What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me
