Hey gutless idol
With nothing on the inside
Your five minutes are up
And you're livin' on borrowed time
So stick ya 'd' tuned guitar
You shoe-gazing wannabe
I'm a hurricane comin'
And hell's coming with me

Guitar attack
So watch your back

I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking
I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking

Your better sit down buddy
I got bad news for you
You never learned how to play
Now your posing days are through
Every kid with a guitar
Is gonna show you it's done
And we ain't gonna stop until the war is won

Guitar attack
So watch you back

I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking
I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking
I'm gonna getcha tonight

It's not the size of the dog in the fight
It's the size of the fight in the dog

Gonna play it loud
Gonna drown you out
Bury you like a bone
No one will ever know
Because you're all the same
You sell yourself for fame

But you never last,
You better watch your back
I'm the black dog
I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking
I'm the black dog
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking

You can't run from
Black dog barking
Black dog
Black dog barking
Coz the hunt is on
Black dog barking
Black dog
I'm gonna get 'cha tonight
I'm the black dog
I'm gonna get 'cha tonight
