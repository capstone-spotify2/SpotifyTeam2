And we'll float to the end, where the oceans do bends, and we'll fly away.
And we'll shine on through, through the summer sky so blue, and we'll drift away.
We wake at ten and start out lives again, it's another day.
Together in a room, where the wall flowers bloom, it's a marigold way.
And we'll stare at the sun, while the sound and shapes run up the chimney.
We will drive in the clouds, trampoline up and down to our symphony.
