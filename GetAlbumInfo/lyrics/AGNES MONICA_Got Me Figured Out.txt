Like a maid I can be difficult
But baby you know how to solve it
Like a student if I misbehaved
Take me to the principal's office

Like a lens out of frame out of range
You know how to keep focus
Like a psychic all over my brain
Boy I bet you didn't think I noticed

Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away
Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away

Like a sport for beating out of flame
May be we can start a fire
You hit the trigger hold that you can name
Just gave me I'm a moving target

Like a lens out of frame out of range
You know how to keep focus
Like a psychic all over my brain
Boy I bet you didn't think I noticed

Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away
Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away

You saw that through the very hard of me, baby I'm letting go
And I have to run I have to run again
And the part of letting go is to get the whole control
We got chemistry some crazy energy baby take me I'm all yours

Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away
Got me figured out <i>[4x]</i>
I'd like to put your love to the test before I give my love away
