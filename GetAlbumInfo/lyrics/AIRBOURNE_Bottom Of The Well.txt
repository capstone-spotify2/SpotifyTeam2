I gotta get out I gotta break free 
Ain't gonna live in misery 
My minds made up I'm leaving today 
Come hell or high water I'm will break these chains 
Gonna scratch my way, claw my way, 
Dig my way, back to the top 
Cause I never say die, I never give in 
I never stop giving it all that I got 
I'm breaking out of hell 

From the bottom of the well 
It's a long way down 
From the bottom of the well 
I gotta get out 
From the bottom of the well 

It's so dark and cold down here 
I'm all alone but I got no fear 
Cause I Have the will to beat this fate 
And get back up to the light of day 
Gonna scratch my way, claw my way, 
Cause I never say die, I never give in 
I never stop giving it all that I got 
I'm breaking out of hell 

From the bottom of the well 
It's a long way down 
From the bottom of the well 
I gotta get out 
Diggin and clawing and scratching and kicking my way 
Back to the top I will fight for the light of day 
Gonna finde the way yeah 

I made a death wish and it came true 
I'm under water black and blue 
But if you think I'm done you better think again 
You better think again cause I don't know the meaning of death 

I'm gonna scratch my way, claw my way 
Never stop givin it all that I got 
I'm breaking out of hell 
I'm breaking out of hell 

From the bottom of the well 
It's a long way down 
From the bottom of the well 
I gotta get out 

I'm breaking out of hell
