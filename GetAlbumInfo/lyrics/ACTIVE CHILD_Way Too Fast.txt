I fall in love
Way too fast
At least i'm in a better place
I fall in love
Way too fast
I don't know what else to say
You know
Oh you're so damn cold
Soon you'll be all by yourself
And you know
Oh you're so damn cold
Soon you'll be all by yourself
I trust in you
Way too fast
Didn't think you'd do me like that
I put my trust in you
Way too fast
You didn't even say goodbye
But you know
Oh, you're so damn cold
Soon you'll be all by yourself
You know
Oh, you're so damn cold
Soon you'll be all by yourself
Yourself...
