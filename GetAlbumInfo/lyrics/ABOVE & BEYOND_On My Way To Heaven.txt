You always laugh when I cry
I'm always looking to tomorrow
As you mourn the days gone by
You always tread on my toes
But my guiding hand of love
Is helping everywhere you go
I'm always WRONG you're always RIGHT
But I can see right through the LIES
To the never changing light

Rain on me, my arms are cold
I want to get home but there's water on the road
And if I do, you will not change
I'm just a singing satellite in an orbit
that is strange

I want to laugh, I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
And stop me THINKING for a while

I'm just a fool hung on a sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am a king, a KING
A king of everything &amp; nothing
I'm on my way to heaven

I'm always here, I'm in denial
And when there's nothing left between us
I will stay another while
You know you're free, you've got your wings
And I am just another angel
With a voice who wants to sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Almighty
I'm on my way to heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way to HEAVEN

I want to cry, I want to steal
A little ray of perfect sunshine
From the sun above the hill
I want to laugh, I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
And stop me THINKING for a while

I'm just a fool hung on a sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am a king, a KING
A king of everything &amp; nothing

I'm on my way to heaven
