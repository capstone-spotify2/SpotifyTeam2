A year from now, we won't be pretty
A year from now, we won't be young
But we will live among the giants
Before the giants learn the run

Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home

We would sail across the ocean
If cloudy skies should take our friends
And we will learn from the giants
Before the giants learn from them

Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home

What can I say, without a say?
We've got a way to go, and what can I do
To get back to you, and help us to find a home
To search the green and town

A year from now, we won't be lovers
We'll just be suits and ties and shoes
And we will grow without our parents
'cause soon we will be giants too

Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good
To feel at home

What can I say, without a say?
We've got a way to go, and what can I do
To get back to you, and help us to find a home
To search the green and town

I will search the green, and I will search the town
But I will never find no one like you. <i>[6x]</i>
