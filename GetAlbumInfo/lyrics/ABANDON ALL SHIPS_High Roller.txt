Hell exists believe it or not
I made a deal with the devil 
and now he's stuck in my thoughts but
Little does he know
I have no fucking soul

You fuel the fire that burns me alive
Locked in a gaze of every eye
Of enemies that came in disguise
I hope you bite your tongue on every lie

I do know one thing though
The devils good to know
Bitches they come and go
But I'll never sink that low

I'll tell you one thing though
They try and take your soul
You'll be the first to know
I'll never let you go

We are who we are

It's my life
I'm praying for a change
I know I've made my mistakes
I need to escape
From this hell that I create

Broken promises
Cut like glass on the floor
But bleeding out your sins will never
Settle the score
Inked in blood you'll see
You can't trust a mother fucker like me

You want to escape every one of your dreams
Trapped in a cage permanently
Your mind is a prison missing a key
Choke on your lies like
Anxiety

It's my life
I'm praying for a change
I know I've made my mistakes
I need to escape
From this hell that I create

I have no soul
I feel so damn alone
I have no fucking soul
I feel so damn alone
