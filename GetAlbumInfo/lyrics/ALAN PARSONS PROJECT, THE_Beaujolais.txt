No clock beside my bed
Don't try to wake me
No phone upon my wall
Who's going to call

No knock upon my door
No news to shake me
Nights like the one before
I can't take no more

Beaujolais goes straight to my head
Beaujolais puts me to shame
And I don't know why I'm in this place or how I came
Beaujolais and I go crazy
Beaujolais I can't explain
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain

One race that I can't win
With an alter ego

One chance to sink or swim
What am I to do

One tail that I can't shake
Wherever I go he go
One circuit I can't break
It's a catch twenty two

Beaujolais goes straight to my head
Beaujolais' the one to blame
And I don't know why I'm in this place or how I came
Beaujolais will be my ruin
Beaujolais I can't complain
Cause it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain
