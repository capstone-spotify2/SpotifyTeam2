I'm gonna stop pretending
Cause you see through it all
And I start believing
You're gonna break down my walls

Ohh Oh

Cause I think you figured out
I don't belong here
And I've been living on the Edge

So we dream
Big Fast
Life won't stop
Don't mind
Don't look at me like that (Don't look at me like that)

On the warm night
start light
Wide eyed
Fireflies
Don't look at me like that
Cause you might see through me

All my darkest secrets (All my secrets)
I will tell them to you
Cause I know you'll listen (Listen)
When It's just me and you

Ohh Oh

We're alone and we're alive
And we belong here
Now we are living on the Edge

And we dream
Big Fast
Life won't stop
Don't mind
Don't look at me like that (Don't look at me like that)

On the warm night
start light
Wide eyed
Fireflies
Don't look at me like that
Cause you might see through me

Yeah

And It's a long way down
It's a long way
But the view up here is amazing

Ohh

And we dream
Big Fast
Life won't stop
Don't mind
Don't look at me like that (Don't look at me like that)

On the warm night
start light
Wide eyed
Fireflies
Don't look at me like that
Cause you might see right through me

So see through me <i>[x3]</i>

You'll see through me
