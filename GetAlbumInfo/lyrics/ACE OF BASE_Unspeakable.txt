All I wanna say to you
Oh yeah!

I was unfeeling
when you discovered me
Give me a reason
To not deny my needs
I was unwilling
to give my love away
But you decided
To give yours anyway

Oh I can't express
The feeling I posses for you baby

All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define
Unspeakable

Mmmh, oh yeah

Never thought I needed
someone to call my own
But now that you've got me
Don't ever let me go
You leave me unwanting
Your silence every need
Nothing is missing
No love is so complete

Oh I can't express
The feeling I posses for you baby

All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define
Unspeakable

Never had this feeling
That brings me to my knees
You helped me to recover
What's been eluding me
You're a sensation
That makes my love run free
And now I'm speechless
It's all so clear to me

All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define it

All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable (you leave me unspeakable)
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you is na na na na
Unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define it (unspeakable)
