A touch of poison seals my fate
The dawn echoes the night with my glory... the sun himself honors me

Once king of roses, now lord of gold
Blessed with the gift of gilded touch
The Gods themselves envy my hand
Fate wields its knife to cut the thread

I curse the day my dream became my descent
Suddenly, I long for you, my only love

In my perfection I have no want
A folly as fatal as sin
Yet eyes still glint with greed untold
Has now become the end of me

I curse the day my dream became my descent
Suddenly, I long for you, my only love

Have I not earned this, the gift of beauty within?
How selfish were the Gods to keep their riches from my rightful treasure?
I truly have become one of them... my fatal flaw

Oh yeah! I've got her hook, line, and sinker!
Thanks to me, she's her own new necklace
Now she's good as gold
Thanks to me, she's her own new necklace
Now she's good as gold

I curse the day my dream became my descent
Suddenly, I long for you, my only love
I curse the day my dream became my descent
Suddenly, I long for you, my only love...
Cut the thread
