<i>[The Misfits Cover Song]</i>

Bonfires burning bright
Pumpkin faces in the night
I remember halloween
Dead Cats hanging from poles
Little Dead are out in droves
I remember Halloween
Brown Leafed Vertigo
Where skeletal life is known
I remember Halloween
This day anything goes
Burning bodies hanging from poles
I remember Halloween

Halloweeeeen
Halloweeeeen
Halloweeeeen
Halloween!

Candy apples and razor blades
Little dead are soon in graves
I remember Halloween
This day anything goes
Burning bodies hanging from poles
I remember Halloween
