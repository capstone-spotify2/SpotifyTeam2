My mind is razor-sharp
And I'm wild-cat-mean
I'd like to shred your face
A danger to you
When I feel the urge
Deep down inside
I lose my human touch
I'm like a killing machine

I want to resist - but I can't hold it back
The beast is unleashed - it's got to attack
Again and again the force is too strong
It's breaching the chains

I've got the beast inside
Don't you trust in me
I've got the beast inside
Craving a victim - it's telling me to kill

I look through evil eyes
Prowling in the streets
In the dead of night
I'm a man on the hunt

I know my soul is under siege
Can't somebody stop me now
'cause I'm losing control

I've got the beast inside
Don't you trust in me
I know it must have been
the beast inside
It's driving me to kill

It's gotta be the beast - the beast - the beast
The beast - the beast - the beast - deep down inside

But when the deed is done
And the pain is gone
I feel renewed within
Until the voices return

The beast - the beast - the beast
The beast - the beast - the beast

My mind is razor-sharp
And I'm wild-cat-mean
I'd like to shred your face
I've told you before

When I feel the urge
Deep down inside
I lose my human touch
I'm just a killing machine

I want to resist 
but I can't hold it back
The beast is unleashed 
it's got to attack
Again and again the force is too strong
It's breaching the chains

It's gotta be the beast inside
Never ever trust in me
I know there is a beast inside
Inside in all of us

I feel I've got the beast inside
I'm screaming for help from this monster within
The beast inside - take a look in
the mirror - it's staring at you
Even at you - the beast inside
