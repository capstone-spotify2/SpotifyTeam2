Baby I'm on the hunt
Baby I've got my target on you
Trouble, that's what I want
And I'm gonna do just what I have to
Get your ass down to the front
Go on and pull it out, I dare you
Sorry I'm kinda drunk
But did you just say your game was brand new?

No I ain't broken but I, I need a fix
That satisfaction when I, I get my kicks
I'm up all night
I'm out of sight
Don't turn on the light
Cause I'm feeling so shady lately

Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
The freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it way up
Don't stop the beat

Come on and turn me, turn me on
Cause I'm feeling so shady lately

Ah! Ah!
Gonna go and get me a shot
Gonna knock it back forget all my blues
Yeah that really hits the spot
I'm feeling pretty fierce in my dancin' shoes (yeah)

No I ain't broken but I, I need a fix
That satisfaction when I, I get my kicks
I'm up all night
I'm out of sight
Don't turn on the light
Cause I'm feeling so shady lately

Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
The freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it way up
Don't stop the beat

Come on and turn me, turn me on
Cause I'm feeling so shady lately

<i>[Sam Sparro:]</i>
I throw more shade than a cloudy day
The brakes don't work
I'm just a runaway train
Somebody come and help me out
All I wanna be is free
I'm just tryin' to get down
Now I can't get up
I'm shady lately

Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
The freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it way up
Don't stop the beat

Come on and turn me, turn me on
Cause I'm feeling so shady lately

(Shady lately, that's how I play,
They say maybe it's just a phase
Shady lately, runaway train
Blame the game, quit blaming the gays)

'Cause I'm feelin' so shady lately
