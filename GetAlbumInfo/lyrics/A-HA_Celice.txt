Celice
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice
I know that I'm alive

Open up inside
Make me want you
Make me want to

Wrap yourself around me
Hold me tighter
Hold me tight as you can

Celice
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice
You sharpen all my sense
I know you're on my side

Celice
It's on the way you teach me
Celice
To chase the thoughts away
You opened up my eyes
Made me want you
Made me want to

You know it feels so nice
Hold me tight now
Hold me tight as can be

Celice
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice
I know that I'm alive
Celice
You sharpen all my sense
I know you're in my side
