The sites are set, The target is locked
The weapon is armed, And the barrel is cocked
The earth is quaking, The walls are shaking
Your heart is racing, And you back is breaking
Are you ready? Ready to rock
Are your ready? I said are you ready?
Whoa, you better get ready

Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock

Well we got it rocking, Whoa we got it pumping
And there's no stopping, Cos the place is jumping
the earth is quaking, The walls are shaking
Your heart is racing, And your back is breaking
Are you ready? Ready to rock
Are your ready? I said are you ready?
Whoa, you better get ready

Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock

Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
Ready to Rock
