Iâm addicted to her, for that love Iâm a fiend 
Just imagine your touches, I can picture your rubbinâ
But I smile when I see ya, girl Iâm high of your lovinâ
Live my life like a dream, every king needs a queen
Girl my life is a movie, sipping Goose in Jacuzzi
Picture staring this movie, picture dripping in Luis 
See us cruising on yachts, while we feasting on sushi 
Used to mingle with groupies, they be begging to do me
But my mind on my misses, never mind all dem women
Feel me tasting your kisses, and itâs you what Iâm missing
Girl Iâll trade in this living, I just want you to listen
