Everything that I am
Slipping through my hands
And roads that I walk on somehow all feel wrong
But here with you I see a reason to believe
Inside I'm not alone
You make this house a home

Can you tell me who I am
Cause there's no one else who can
I'm lost and upside down
But here with you I'm found
Right here with you I'm found

Every note that I write will keep you close tonight
And the morning all my fears seem to disappear

Can you tell me who I am
Cause there's no one else who can
I'm lost and upside down
But here with you I'm found
Right here with you I'm found

Well you know it's not that bad
Wanting to give all I have
I may be lost a grain of sand
But maybe in time
I'll grow to be a better man

So... so...

Everything that I am
Slipping through my hands
And the roads that I've walked down
From Seul to London town
Let me hear with you I'm found

Can you tell me who I am
Cause there's no one else who can
I'm lost and upside down
But here with you I'm found
Right here with you I'm found
I'm found, I'm found
Here with you I'm found
