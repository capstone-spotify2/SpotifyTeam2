Giving this world everything I've got
Running through the woods, running through this shots
Tryna to survive a day!
All I want is that you extend your hand to me
Singing outside waiting for the words to come
Living my life tryna do what's right,
And hope for a better day
You know those words you wrote me brought me to my knees
All I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

Singing outside waiting for the world to call
Living my life tryna do what's right
In the hope of a better day
And all I want is that you extend your hand to me
Oooh, I want show me where it hurts,
We'll make it OK
Tell me that you'll stay
Even when I'm far away
My voice will carry through
Until the end it's me &amp; you
We can make it if we try
All that I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

You're never gonna be alone
