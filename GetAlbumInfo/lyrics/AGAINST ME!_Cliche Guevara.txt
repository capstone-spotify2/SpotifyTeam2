And we'll keep ourselves in a place where it's easy to hold onto. 
And as the last threats came and went; this is the way that wars are played. 
Always heading for a front, heading for a front, headed we go.
Into the obscurity of an easy to pass on feeling
Objection is so clichÃ©.

A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way on.

So can your pop sensibilities sing me the end of the world? 
Turn gunshots and mortar blasts into a metaphor of how we are all the same. 
Well there's a lot of things that should be said, said, so we're hammering six strings.
Machine gun in audible voices, this is the party we came for. 

A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way.

We stand in amazement of motion in a world that is constantly revolving. 
With plans of invasion and arms races racing, yeah we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock to the new sensation. 

A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way on.
A new way on.
