Come on say after me
I'm happy, happy as can be
Hip, hip hooray
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
I ain't no better to be safe than sorry

So here's a kid lesson, my number one
All's good that starts well and moves with the sun

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
I'm me, oh
Today is another day to find you
Anchors away
I'll be coming for your love, okay

So here's a kid lesson, my number one
All's good that starts well and moves with the sun
So here's a kid lesson, my number one
All's good that starts well and moves with the sun

Say after me
I'm happy, happy as can be
Hip, hip hooray
Slowly learning that life is okay
I know that life's okay
I know that life's all good
I know that life can be wrong
A-ha
I know it's meant to be good

So here's a kid lesson, my number one
All's good that starts well and moves with the sun
So here's a kid lesson, my only one
