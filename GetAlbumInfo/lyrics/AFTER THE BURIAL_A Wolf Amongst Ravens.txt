Where do we begin
We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted

Where do we begin
When everything is wrong we just forget
Move along and we play pretend
Surround your life with silver and gold
Your tinsel dreams and the make believe

Deconstructed and paralyzed
So slowly somehow I am evaporating
We dream to be the lesser
A malign separate existence
We be little ourselves to a lesser
Being our dreams are not our dreams

Cogitation a distant fragment
Separate me from the whole
My thoughts are now unchained

And it seems that in everything
We want isn't anything we need

And all the signals
We seem to have taken for granted
We are lost, we are polluted
Into the grey a wolf amongst ravens

Lines flicker and twist descending
A distorted creation from nothing
So monstrous, so murderous

Lay your body down
And separate were shedding skin
Scale by scale the filth replaces it
You crystalize the world around you
Your aim for the weak
A twisting sleep breaks inside of me

A sickness you live in
I begin to break away
Please set me free

I will remain amongst the filth
Conceal myself in this residuum
I will remain amongst the filth
Asking where do we begin

We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, where do we begin

We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted
We are lost, we are polluted
Into the grey a wolf amongst ravens
