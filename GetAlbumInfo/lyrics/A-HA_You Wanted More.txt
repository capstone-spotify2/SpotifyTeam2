You know the way
You've been before 
I've seen the signs 
Outside your door
You set the rules 
The bitter days 
Can't be ignored 
It's just the same 
Just like before 
You wanted more

I love the sun
I love the rain
You gave it up 
But all in vain 
I love the way 
It was before 
So bittersweet 
To be adored 
We had it all 
You let it go 
You wanted more 

But in the end 
What is a friend 
If not some one
To help pretend
Remember me
You know my name 
I'm still the same 
But not for you 
That's not enough 
You wanted more

I love the sun
I love the rain 
You gave it up 
But all in vain
You couldn't change 
You know the score 
So bittersweet
To be adored 
We had it all 
You gave it up 
You wanted more 

But in the end 
What is a friend...

You loved the way 
It used to be 
The way you are 
You and me 
You came too late 
You left too soon 
Just like the rings
Around the moon 
We had it all 
You let it go
You wanted more 
We had it all 
You gave it up 
You wanted more
