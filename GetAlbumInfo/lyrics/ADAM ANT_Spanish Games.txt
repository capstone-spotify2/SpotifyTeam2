Now I don't go to much on names
No, I don't go to much on names
When there's spanish games
You can play if you want to
Always try to look our best
Frills and spanish dress
When we want to
She can be my matador
Chase me round the floor
When she wants to
Figures charge in burning red
Angels fear to tread
Should they want to
She can be my matador
Chase me round the floor
If she wants to
Never want to cruise about
Never bothered showing out
You only want to wear me out
No. I don't go to much on names
When there's spanish games
You can play if you want to
