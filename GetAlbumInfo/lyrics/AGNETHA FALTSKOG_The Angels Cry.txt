I always knew we were meant to be lovers,
I always knew we were made for each other,
I always knew there was no one else
Could make me feel this way
But when you go away,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye.

The summer sun always shines when you're with me,
I feel it's warmth in the love that you give me,
I feel your touch and I know
That's where I always want to stay
But when you go away,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye.

When we're apart, the rain it falls,
The wind it calls, for you my love,
Right from the start when our love was young
The rising sun, the only one was you my love.

I always knew we were meant to be lovers,
I always knew we were made for each other,
I always knew there was no one else
Could make me feel this way
But when you go away,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye.

The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry....
