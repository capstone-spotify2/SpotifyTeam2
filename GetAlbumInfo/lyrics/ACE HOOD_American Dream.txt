See, not many get to see this side of life, baby
You should be thankful

I can take you places you never been
I can show you things you ain't ever seen
Hit the shopping centers in Beverly
Introducing you to the finer things
That's the American Dream
That's the American Dream, baby
Let's go take over the world
That's the American dream
That's the American dream

Oh man, chump chains for these Balmains
Courtside, Heat game, couple gold chains
50 on the Rollie just to watch the time change
Living lavish, ain't no average in my mind frame
Out of state, we order steaks, it's rated five star
Park the <i>[?]</i> and the valet think I'm a pop star
I'm tryna cuff her life hoppin' out of a cop car
Fuck a hater, they stacking carts at the Wal-Mart
Same time. baby, we be <i>[?]</i> the first class
Got her poppin' that Givenchy on her handbag
Passport stamping you deserve that
Snapchat

I can take you places you never been
I can show you things you ain't ever seen
Hit the shopping centers in Beverly
Introducing you to the finer things
That's the American dream
That's the American dream, baby
Let's go take over the world
That's the American dream
That's the American dream

Long sex on the beach, baby why not?
Tongue go to teasin' all the soft spots
Let's post a picture for them to talk about
They hate how we livin', they try and sabotage
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, baby
Them hoes hella shady
Cause we hella wavy
In that brand new Mercedes
Saks Fifth on the daily
Get whatever you want
That's the type of shit I'm on, yeah
How it feel, you'll be waking up in paradise
We sexing in the mansion till the sun arise
Crash livin', praying that we never die
You with me, right?

I can take you places you never been
I can show you things you ain't ever seen
Hit the shopping centers in Beverly
Introducing you to the finer things
That's the American dream
That's the American dream, baby
Let's go take over the world
That's the American dream
That's the American dream
