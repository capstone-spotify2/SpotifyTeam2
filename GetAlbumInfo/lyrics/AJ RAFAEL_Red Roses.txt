There you are
With your light brown hair
Apologize 'cause all that I did was stare
And no I'm not a creeper I swear that I'm a keeper
I'm just glad you noticed that I was there

I got your name but I didn't get your number
So now I'm left with all this regret and wonder
Would you wanna see me
Or would you wanna kiss me
I'm getting way ahead of myself
But I can't get you off of my mind
No I can't
No I can't

Cause

I wish I would've asked you out
I wish I didn't have these doubts about myself
For those 3 minutes that you stood in front of me
I wish I hadn't walked away
I wish I had the guts to say
Would you be mine
I wish I woulda asked you to be my valentine

Ooh
Be my valentine
Yeah

Uh, so I had one more chance
To gather my thoughts and just spit it out
But now I've missed the moment
And now I'd never know if
You'll answer yes to the questions I ask

So now I'm here
Without you I'm crushed cause I got these roses
These red roses and God knows that
I would've given them to you
I can't get you off my mind
No I can't
I really can't

Cause

I wish I would've asked you out
I wish I didn't have these doubts about myself
For those 3 minutes that you stood in front of me
I wish I hadn't walked away
I wish I had the guts to say
Would you be my
I wish I woulda asked you to be my valentine

I hope that you notice
That I'm still paintin' roses
Or should I let this all go

I wish I would've asked you out
I wish I didn't have these doubts about myself
For those 3 minutes that you stood in front of me
I wish I hadn't walked away
I wish I had the guts to say
Would you be my
I wish I woulda asked you to be my valentine

Ooh

Be my valentine
Oh yeah
Would you be my valentine
Oo oo
Would you be
Would you be

I wish I woulda asked you to be my valentine
