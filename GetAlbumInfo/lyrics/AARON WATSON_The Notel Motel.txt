He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be
He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring
So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder
He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her

And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel

Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two
Despite his wife and picture perfect life he's to good to be true
While he's flirting she'd swear he's working on a job out of town
A married man, you know he's got no business messing around

And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel

It's a five star chain or a run down dirt cheap no name
With or without room service what done is the same

And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
