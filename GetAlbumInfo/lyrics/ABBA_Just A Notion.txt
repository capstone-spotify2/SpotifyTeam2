Ah-ah

Just a notion, that's all.
Just a feeling that you're watching me.
Ah-ha-ha-ha
Every move I'm making.
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me.
Ah-ha-ha-ha
There is no mistaking.

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me,
In a while,
And you'll smile,
And say 'hello',
And we'll be dancing through the night,
Knowing everything from there on must be right.
Just a notion
And somehow I know I'm not wrong.
If it's our destiny, there's nothing we can do.
And tonight is very special; it's the night for me and you.
