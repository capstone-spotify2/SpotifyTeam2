Love me, love me tender
My being surrenders to you
'Cause you know what to do
So make me, make me tremble
That will be a symbol of
The L-O-V-E's there when
We make love
We make love

Ya bring me pleasure
When I'm feelin' pain
I go to meet ya
In the fallin' rain
It's such a pleasure
When ya call my name
Stay tonight and
Play the pleasure game

So baby, be gentle
And cuddle a little with me
Then tell me tenderly
You want me, want me forever
And say there's no better love
Than what you get
When we make love
We make love

Ya bring me pleasure
When I'm feelin' pain
I go to meet ya
In the fallin' rain
It's such a pleasure
When ya call my name
Stay tonight and
Play the pleasure game

Your love is such a pleasure
And I'm so glad you found me
I'm yours measure for measure
Just wrap your arms around me

Ya bring me pleasure
When I'm feelin' pain
I go to meet ya
In the fallin' rain
It's such a pleasure
When ya call my name
Stay tonight and
Play the pleasure game

The L-O-V-E's there
When we make love
We make love

Ya bring me pleasure
When I'm feelin' pain
I go to meet ya
In the fallin' rain
It's such a pleasure
When ya call my name
Stay tonight and
Play the pleasure game
