Oh my god, what's going on?
This night got fucking weird
Drove so fast my brain got buzzed
And now I'm standing here
Met so many faces that
Will probably forget me
Boy, I bet I look so grown up
Shirt tucked in my jeans

And now after it all
I just really wanna call
My dad
My dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broke up, I wanna go home

We went dancing on the roof
And took some girls uptown
They started fighting with my friends
And I can't find them now
We hit some bars and saw some brawls
And found there a house to sleep
Forgot my retainer, could you
Not be mad at me?

'Cause now after it all
I'm just standing here to call
My dad
My dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
