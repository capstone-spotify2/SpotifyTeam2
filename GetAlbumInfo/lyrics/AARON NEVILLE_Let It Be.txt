When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they may see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
(Let it be, let it be)

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
(Just let it be)

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
(Let it be, let it be, oh, let it be)
There will be an answer, let it be
