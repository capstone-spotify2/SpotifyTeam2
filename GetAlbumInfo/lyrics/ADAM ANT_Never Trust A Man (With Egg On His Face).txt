A man and a woman walking down the street
With a son and a daughter it was oh so sweet
When Mummy turned to Daddy and she said:
"My dear, write out your will because the end is near"

Then she pulled out the gun, I saw the sparks
Messed up the suit that he'd bought from Marks
Because

She'd heard the voices from outer space
She'd heard the voices from outer space
She'd heard the voices from outer space
Saying, "Never trust a man with egg on his face"

Three months later, Mrs B. stands
A smile on her face, blood on her hands
The kiddies got scared and ran home to bed
The headlines in the papers said that

She was the victim of an awful plan
Announced through the mouthpiece of a little green man
She'd heard the voices from outer space
Saying, "Never trust a man with egg on his face"
"Never trust a man with egg on his face"
