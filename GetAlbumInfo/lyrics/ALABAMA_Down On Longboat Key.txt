She sits and stares out the window at the water
Every night down at Longy's Cafe
All alone she sips her Pina Colada
Talking to herself dreaming time away
The story is that a dark haired sailor
Stole her heart many years ago
He promised her he'd come back and take her
Around the world, bring her hills of gold

Down on Longboat Key
Where the island sand meets the gulf stream breeze
Down on Longboat Key
She spends her life in a dream
On Longboat Key
Down on Longboat Key
Down on Longboat Key

Each afternoon as the smelt boats comes in
She runs to meet them down at the pier
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears
She stands there looking at the crystal blue water
And in the coral she imagine pearls
She makes believe he brought them all the way from China
Then the water swirls
The blue green water swirls

Down on Longboat Key
Where the island sand meets the gulf stream breeze
Down on Longboat Key
She spends her life in a dream
On Longboat Key
Down on Longboat Key
Down on Longboat Key

Young sailors makes a play to take her home
She says,No, I'm already taken.
Oh, they just laugh when she mentions his name
She keeps on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Down on Longboat Key
Where the island sand meets the gulf stream breeze
Down on Longboat Key
She spends her life in a dream
Down on Longboat Key (Down on Longboat Key)
Down on Longboat Key, yeah, yeah

Down on Longboat Key (down on Longboat
Where the island sand meets the gulf stream breeze
Down on Longboat Key (Down on Longboat Key)
Down on Longboat Key, yeah, yeah
Down on Longboat Key...
