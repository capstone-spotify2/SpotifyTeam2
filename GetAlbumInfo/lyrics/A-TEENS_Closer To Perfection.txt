Clo-ser, to-to perfection
Clo-ser, to-to perfection

Closed every door
Puttin' everything aside
Hooked onto you
And my life was passing by
I stood in a cloud of dust
Blinded till you cut me off

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I'm back in the light
Getting over you
Now I got it together
I'm stronger than ever
Back on a track with a better view
And I'm getting closer to perfection
Cause of you

Clo-ser, to-to perfection
Gone in a beat
Suddenly out of my sight
Shook me around
Like a thunder bolting strike
I stand in the light of faith
I thank you in so many ways

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Closer perfection cause of you
(dont-dont-dont-dont-dont-dont-dont-get-get-get-get-get) <i>[x2]</i>

All the things I wouldn't do
Without holding onto you
Lost in the dark
Til you left me with a clue

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

And I'm getting closer to perfection
Cause of you
