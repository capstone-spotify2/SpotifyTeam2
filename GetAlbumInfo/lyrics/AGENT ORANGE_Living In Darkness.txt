look at me now, i've got no reason to be
like everybody else - so dumb, so happy
i like things that bite
things that creep at night
everybody's asking me
what's it like down there?
the concrete floor is cold
the walls are bare

i feel safest being alone
living in darkness
living in a world of my own

i'm so selfish
doing everything by myself
i feel so cold
i'm gonna live
to be a couple thousand years old
ashes to ashes - dust to dust
i thought i knew somebody
that i could trust
now i'm not so sure

i feel safest being alone
living in darkness
living in a world of my own

one whole lifetime
i'm never gonna last
unless i live until
dying is a thing of the past
and all these girls i know
out turning boys into men
i know i am never going down again
never again
