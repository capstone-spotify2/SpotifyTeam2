Washed on a shore of enchanted lies and I am breathless
Struggling for reason
How could it be such a wondrous place is trapped in silence?
Give them redemption

Time is melting away, I can't explain
But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

I can't imagine my leaving here,
It sounds so peaceful, living in solace
A perfect vision of ecstasy, a dreamy palace
Home to the soulless

Time is melting away, I can't explain
But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

Walk along the shore of an ocean of rage
Gazing in amazement at each screaming wave
Everywhere I look there's agony and pain
What's the point of fighting when there's nothing to save?

Time is melting away, I can't explain
But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

Caution must be obeyed...
On an island of the decayed...
