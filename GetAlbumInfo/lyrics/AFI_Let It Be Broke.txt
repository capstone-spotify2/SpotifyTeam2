I live in truth, complacently. 
Where's the threat you see in me? 
Am I the cause of your self consciousness? 
You scream at me
'cause I can't ignore the destructiveness that you support, 
'cause my life's contrary to yours. 
No soft words from my mouth.
A glazed look in your eyes. 
I live in the world of reality, you comfort yourself with lies. 
I will release myself, I will detach myself from you. 
I will detach myself from your kind. 
I've seen your life but I can't see how it is
that you can be so content in your own ignorance.
Its been so dark for so long now a new light has come along, 
illuminating all, so shut your eyes.
I won't tell you what you want to hear, 
I will show you what's real. i will, will defy.
