Well the devil may care
You toss 'em back and be a man
With the last time
Black ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Black ice
Black ice

Come on and bleeding out the crowds
We're watching all the women go
Many a mile I'll never take
I run for forty miles and come up runnin' late
Donât you know I live it down
When the devil come a callin' I ain't gonna be around
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
The devil come a callin' I ain't gonna be around
Black ice

Livin' long, livin' long
Sleep all alone, you're gonna take it all
And I'm gonna rip it out
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street, I'll gouge your eyes out
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice

My life
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life
When the devil come a callin' I ain't gonna be around
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street and gouge your eyes out
Black ice
