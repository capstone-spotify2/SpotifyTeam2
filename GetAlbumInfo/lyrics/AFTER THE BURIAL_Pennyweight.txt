Where have I been? Blearing pacific winds
Crossing foothills, constructing stories
Ruptured earth guiding me home
Romantic fault lines
A bridge's quake in my bones
A place we called home
A distance we have learned

Pull me in, and help me out (of this hemisphere)
I want to swim amidst the satellites
Sinking to the bottom. I exhale
Close my eyes- Disengage
Here. There is no there.

Give me (indication). Give me (separation)
With everything seeming pulse-less
Give me (indication). Give me (separation)
I'm drifting into oblivion
And there's no place I'd rather be
I'm drifting into oblivion

Isolated in black- My thoughts spin
My worlds divide

I am lost in space
Burning up in the atmosphere
When I finally come crashing down
Wrap my bones inside miracles
A safe place - I am finally home

Pull me in, and help me out (of this hemisphere)
I want to swim amidst the satellites
Sinking to the bottom. I exhale
Close my eyes - Disengage
Here. There is no there.

Give me (indication). Give me (separation)
With everything seeming pulse-less
Give me (indication). Give me (separation)
I'm drifting into oblivion
Now I'm slipping away.
