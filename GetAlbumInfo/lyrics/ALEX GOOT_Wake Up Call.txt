You're my wake up call
I checked out, I know I can't fall
the way I fell before
I'm finding it hard to admit that I miss you.
And I'm coming undone
you don't know what you've got til it's gone
I've heard that one before..
Still finding it hard to admit that I miss you (oh)

God save my soul, 'cause I wanna know
you were worth it all along
God save my soul, now that I know
what I'm missing

Hit me with just
one shock, one kiss, one reason to live.
I check my pulse, I'm still beating
it's dark but I'll find light again
when I see you again
(oh-oh)

And it's hard to stay real (stay real)
when I can't admit how I feel
and I'm starting to break
do whatever it takes just to say that I miss you 
(I miss you, oh)

God save my soul, 'cause I wanna know
was she worth it all along?
God save my soul, now that I know
what I'm missing

Hit me with just
one shock, one kiss, one reason to live.
I check my pulse, I'm still beating
it's dark but I'll find light again
when I see you again
(oh-oh)

when I see you again
when I see you again
it's dark but I'll find light again
when I see you again

You'll be my wake up call
I checked out, I know I won't fall all over again
I'm finding it hard to admit, I still miss you

So hit me with just
one shock, one kiss, one reason to live.
I checked my pulse, I'm still beating
it's dark but I'll find light again
when I see you again 
(oh-oh)
one shock, one kiss, one reason to live.
I check my pulse, I'm still beating
it's dark but I'll find light again
when I see you again
(oh-oh)
