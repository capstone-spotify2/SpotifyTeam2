Trust in me and I will never let you down
Trust your soul when theres nobody else around
Trust in love cause it will always heal your heartbreaks
And we always learn em better from our mistakes
For me therell never be nobody else but you

I thought of walking by myself
But I could never make it through - without you

Theres nothing we cant over come
Were staring at a bright new sun
Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache
Well touch the earth and kiss the sky
As the same moment passes by
Then well be sure to stay one breathe away from heartache
One breathe from the heartache

Touch my hand if I ever feel that youre weak

Lay your head here on my shoulder when you need
Tell your secrets to me when they get too heavy
And Ill make sure that Im always there for you
I dont need anybody else but you - for me
I dont know if Ill find the words
But if I do will you believe

Theres nothing we cant over come
Were staring at a bright new sun
And well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache
Well touch the earth and kiss the sky
As the same moment passes by
Then well be sure to stay one breathe from a heartache

And I will catch you if you fall
My heart will be there if you call
And I will cover you through anything at all

One breathe from a heartache
Theres nothing we cant over come
Were staring at a bright new sun
Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache
One breathe from a heart ache
Trust in me and I will never let you down
