Fuck that when I die I'd rather go to hell
I speak the fucking truth
It aint hard to fucking tell
I'd tattoo it on my fucking face
Fuck you, I'll never fucking change.

And if I lose all my friends
I'll lift that fucking bottle
And drink it til it ends
You think I'm not that serious
So sit here and pretend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend

Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend

When you've come to the end of the road
And all your stories have been told
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle I've already won
Our wounds become undone
Discover hearts made of gold
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle
I've just begun

I looked into my future
Was blinded by the light
On the path now
Doesn't matter left or right
Never had to choose
Never said I might
Might be fucking short
Never intimidated by height
Baby leave those heels on
I'm almost at the top
Not my fucking peak
So I'm never gonna stop
But maybe I'm too high
Maybe it's the pills I popped
I might fucking die
When I fucking drop.

Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend

Fuck that when I die I'd rather go to hell
I speak the fucking truth
It's not hard to fucking tell
I'd tattoo it, tattoo it on my fucking face
Fuck you, Fuck you, I'll never fucking change.

And if I lose all my friends
I'll lift that fucking bottle
And drink until it ends
You think I'm not that serious
So sit here and pretend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend

Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend

When you've come to the end of the road
And all your stories have been told
21 let me show you what I've done
You're losing battle I've already won
Our wounds become undone
Discover hearts made of gold
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle
I've just begun
