While he's out running around with the boys at the bar downtown
His sweetheart sits at home all alone and she's waiting by the telephone
But he'll spend his quarter somewhere else
Well she's done what a good girl should but she's done all she could
So she packs her bags up for the next plain going home and he's crying by the telephone
But she'll spend her quarter somewhere else

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
And just a call to tell her that you love her
That is all she really ever wanted to hear
And it ain't asking much to tell her that you miss her
Just a call and that's all and she'd still be here
He spends a lot of time on the road breaking even with the rodeo
He knows he should call her but he's barely got enough and making ends meet is tough 
So he'll spend his quarter somewhere else

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

<i>[Instrumental Break]</i>

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

She loves a guitar man who gave his heart to a five-piece band
He sings love songs underneath the neon lights while she alone tonight
Dreaming someday he'll live the songs he sings
Dreaming someday I'll live the songs I sing
