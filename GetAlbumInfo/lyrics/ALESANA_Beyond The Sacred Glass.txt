Quietly I am screaming for help
I calm down and steady myself
Collapse to the ground when I realize I canât breathe
Could this be happening?
Whatâs happening to me?

All the walls are closing in on me
And confusion makes it hard to see
Still my pounding heart is bleeding for you

I know the truth
And I start to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Why the hell am I here?
I start to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Have I succumbed to fear?

Why am I trying the undying?
A ghost of such elegance
Oh why am I racing to be facing
A vision of something so perfect?

I am willing to give whatever it takes
To find forgiveness for my mistakes
So Iâm going to take a chance
And invite the unknown to a deadly dance

I have laid eyes on you
And yet it does not seem as if the earth moved

I know the truth
And I start to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
I will have you tonight!
I start to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
You will be mine tonight!

Why am I trying the undying?
A ghost of such elegance
Oh why am I racing to be facing
A vision of something so perfect?

I am willing to give whatever it takes
To find forgiveness for my mistakes
So Iâm going to take a chance
And invite the unknown to a deadly dance

As I rise to conquer the demons
I sense that the darkness awaits!

That road I walk is paved with a thousand unmarked graves..

I am willing to give whatever it takes
To find forgiveness for my mistakes
So Iâm going to take a chance
And invite the unknown to a deadly dance

I am willing to give whatever it takes
To find forgiveness for my mistakes
So Iâm going to take a chance
And invite the unknown to a deadly dance

As I rise to conquer the demons
I sense that the darkness awaits!
