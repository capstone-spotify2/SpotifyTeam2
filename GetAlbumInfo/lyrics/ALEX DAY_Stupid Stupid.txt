You tell stories that aren't going anywhere
Toast pops, you scream; somehow, always unprepared
Heard the doorbell - I said "it was on TV"
But that won't stop you calling out into the empty street

You left the keys inside, got locked out in the rain
But you know I'm always here to let you in and say

You're stupid stupid
You're stupid stupid
You're stupid stupid
And I love you

Last week I did not remember our anniversary
You said that must be cos I'm a Sagittarius
"You don't make time for me - this is such a shock!"
Strange how you missed that when you read both of our horoscopes!

You didn't eat that pie; it looked like it had eyes
Next time you go without, remember what I'll shout

You're stupid stupid
You're stupid stupid
You're stupid stupid
And I love you

And when you've heard this song, I know just what you'll say ...

I'm stupid stupid
I'm stupid stupid
I'm stupid stupid
And you love me

We're stupid stupid
We're stupid stupid
We're stupid stupid
And you love me
And I love you
