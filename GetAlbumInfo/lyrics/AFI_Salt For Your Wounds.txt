There's a tear in my heart where the blood ran out. 
There's a tear in my heart where the love ran out. I thought
we worked, pushed toward the same ends,
I'll never be so quick to trust again. 
Disenchanted, disgusted, I regret that I trusted. 
I put my faith. 
My faith in you, you poisoned me through and through.
I though we both shared the same injuries. 
Now I've found it's you who injures me. 
My heart is cracked from being left out in the cold.
I know you'll pay for what you've taken - tenfold. 
Disenchanted, disgusted, I regret that I trusted. 
I put my faith. 
My faith in them, they twisted the knife further in.
