We're much too young
Andd life's so big
We don't know yet what the future brings in it's hands for us
What tomarrow brings the future knows

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
We are united

Young and Proud
Young and Proud
We're on the same side of destiny
On the same side of destiny

Anyway anyway you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name
But you never hear me
Anyway anyway you do it wrong
I'm giving you my love
Though it's never for sale

Anyway anyway...
