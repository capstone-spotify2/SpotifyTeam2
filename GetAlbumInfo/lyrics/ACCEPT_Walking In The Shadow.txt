All my fire ain't gone inside
Only with you I will survive
And I live in the shadow of this wall
With fifty-eight thousand all in all

I surrender - I surrender
Heart'n'soul's gone to nowhere

Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
Walking in the shadow - walking in the night

For the very first time in your life
You've not been the last in line
You had to die instead of me
Do I have to live for you now

Is that what you want me to do
Live in agony and pain

Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
In the night

Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
Walking in the shadow - walking in the night

Oh, yeah!
Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
Walking in the shadow - walking in the night
In the night - in the night
