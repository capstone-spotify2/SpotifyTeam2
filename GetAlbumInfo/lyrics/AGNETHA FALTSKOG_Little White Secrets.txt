It comes down to this
Your little white secrets are coming between us
Sooner or later they'll turn into little white lies
And I know, yes I know, that your passion's unspoken
Out of control, you think nobody knows.

I understand you, I understand your little white secrets
I understand you, your strength and your weakness
I wanna know, wanna know you, inside out
Every little thought that you're ashamed about
I understand you, I understand your little white secrets.

Oh Baby go easy,
You don't have to make me your judge and your jury
It's bad enough when you come down so hard on yourself
And I'll still be the one, when you're scared and you're broken
All alone in the dark, let me shake you right down to your heart.

I understand you, I understand your little white secrets
I understand you, your strength and your weakness
I wanna know you, inside out
Every little thought that you're ashamed about
I understand you, I understand your little white secrets.

Burning dreams hiding in your pillow
Makes it hard when you try to live so perfectly
Pretty eyes, dark as a shadow
What do you think I'll see?
Baby, you're just like me...
I understand you.

I wanna know you, inside out
Every little thought that you're ashamed about
I understand you, (yes, I understand) your little white secrets
I understand you, (yes, I understand) your little white secrets
Ohh...(yes, I understand)
Yes, I understand you
Oh yes, I understand you
Yes, I understand you....
