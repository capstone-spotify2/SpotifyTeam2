I've spent a lifetime lookin' for love
Just when I find it, it comes undone
I've tried so hard to make love happen
Like some never endin' pattern
I end up on the sad side of the fun

Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
For me

Well, I've seen people that got it made
They've got someone and love looks great
But me, I've been to every doctor
I've tried it wild and tried it proper
And I always end up watchin' love walk away
That's Ok

Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
For me

I've gotten used to getting over
And hopefully as I grow older
Love won't be so difficult to see
But now for me

Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
For me

Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
Hurtin' comes easy
For me...
