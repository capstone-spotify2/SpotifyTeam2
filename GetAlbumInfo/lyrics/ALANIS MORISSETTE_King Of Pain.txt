There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat caught in the high tree top
There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain.
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign 
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain.

There's a little black spot on the sun today that's my soul up there
It's the same old thing as yesterday that's my soul up there
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top that's my soul up there
There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop that's my soul up there
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain.
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign 
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain.

There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall that's my soul up there
There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall that's my soul up there
There's a blue whale beached by a springtide's ebb that's my soul up there
There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web that's my soul up there
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain.
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign 
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain.

There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt;
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed 
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread.

There's a red fox torn by a huntmen's pack that's my soul up there
There's a black winged gull with a broken back that's my soul up there
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain.
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign 
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain.
King of pain
King of pain
