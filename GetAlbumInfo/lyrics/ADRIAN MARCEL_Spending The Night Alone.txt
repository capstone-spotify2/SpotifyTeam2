<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
(Turn the lights off)
Those kisses never seem to fade away
I can feel em on my face
They still feel perfect
Thatâs why I canât go another day
Love it when I see you smile
Happy just to be there
Even when youâre down girl
Iâve been needing you around girl yeah yeah

<i>[Prehook:]</i>
But you been missing for too long
And I ainât ready to move on
Iâm calling all your friends to
Help me find you baby

<i>[Hook x2:]</i>
She got me laying here by the phone
I canât keep spending the night alone
Iâve got all I could ever want
But it just ainât enough if it ainât you baby

<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Ainât enough
When it ainât you baby

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Driving past your mamaâs house
Hoping just to catch a
Short glimpse of you
And Iâll be hoping that you donât find out
How much itâs killing me girl
Please girl, my heart canât take another day, no no no no no

<i>[Hook x2]</i>

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[Verse 3 - x2:]</i>
Itâs hurting me when sheâs not near
Our love it bleeds, I need her here
Iâm not complete, no sheâs my air
Yeah, yeah
