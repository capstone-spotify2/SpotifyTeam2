Yeah, again

Sally was a girl that lived in Memphis
Was down on all the latest dances
I found the groove and Sally start to move
And all the guys taking chances and everybody would say

Ride Sally ride, is all you gotta do wipe your weepin' eyes
Tell you just shake it to the east now, baby, yeah just
Shake it to the west now, baby, hey, baby just
Shake now, shake it, shake, shake it, yeah

Sally would dance all night long, this is what I say to you, yeah
How we fly we doin' till we die
We dancin' till the night is through
Everybody sing

Ride Sally ride, oh, make me feel good
Wipe your weeping eyes, all you gotta do is
Tell you just shake it to the east now, baby, I'd keep on sayin'
Shake it to the west now, baby, gettin' good, I said

Shake it, shake it, babe
Shake it, yeah, shake it, yeah
Early in the morning yeah
In the evenin' go on and shake it, hey, hey baby

Ride Sally ride
Lord, have mercy
Wipe your weeping eyes
Ride Sally ride
