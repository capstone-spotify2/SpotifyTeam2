You found out 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You must have heard it from my best friend 
She's always talkin' when she should be listening 
Can't keep a secret to save her life 
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside 
I never knew a rumour could spread so fast 
But now the word is out all over town 
That I'm longing for you 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
Maybe I was the one who left a trace 
Was there a message written on my face 
Were my emotions so easily read 
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said 
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control 
Because the way you move was so self-assured 
You knew I would surrender 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You found out I've got a crush on you.
