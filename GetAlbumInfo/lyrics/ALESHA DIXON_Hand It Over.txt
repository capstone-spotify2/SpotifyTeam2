There's a part
That doesn't even work at all,
Ran out of power cause I left it on,
But there's a part that still believes in love,
But now it's turning cold...

Cause I let somebody handle,
And I made it hurt again, yeah
Cause they did it so much damage,
Never thought it would work again, no
But I found the pieces,
Every single one,
And I put 'em back,
Never wanna go through that again!

Oh no, Say no no
Say never wanna, say no no

Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you help my heart,
Out with a beat or two,
Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you be careful, careful, careful, careful...

When you're close,
My heart's way above the ground,
But then it falls when you're not around,
It beats and it pounds,
I can't turn it down,
And now I'm afraid...

Cause I let somebody handle,
And I made it hurt again, yeah
Cause they did it so much damage,
Never thought it would work again, no
But I found the pieces,
Every single one,
And I put 'em all back,
Never wanna go through that again!

Oh no, Say no no
Say never wanna, say no no

Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you help my heart,
Out with a beat or two,
Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you be careful...

You got so many things about you,
And I don't have the words to say,
Cause my heart is doin' the talking,
Can you hear it,
It's callin' your name...

I wanna had it over,
Hand it over to you...
I wanna had it over,
Yeah, yeah...

Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you help my heart,
Out with a beat or two,
Oh if I hand it over to you,
Would you be careful <i>[x3]</i>
