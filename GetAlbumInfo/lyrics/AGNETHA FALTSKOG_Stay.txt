I know you've been around, I don't mind,
You know I've been down, for such a long time,
We both wanna care
Lonely hearts searching for someone there
We could have, should have
All the love we've waited to share.

Stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?
Oh stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?

You know I need you
And I know that you need me too,
Come close and look in my eyes
There's a light shining for you.

Stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?
Oh stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?

Make up your mind, decide,
If we are making love tonight
Tell me yes tonight I might
Open the door it's gonna be alright.
Make up your mind, decide,
Open the door it's gonna be alright now.

Stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?
Oh stay, I want you to stay, I want you to stay,
Isn't it time we stopped running away?
Oh stay, please stay, I want you to stay
I need you, isn't it time we stopped running away....
