I've been be-troubled
There ain't nobody double
Can't stand them words of things that are happening to me
Somebody hand me a tissue
Cause I got issues
Call it crazy but its so meant to be
Some thinks its so, much energy
So call me miss heartbreak, cause I know what I need

Its bigger than love
Its better than trust
And you would think that's enough
I'll never give up
Addicted to the rush
I may be young but I'm dangerous

The rank is falling
Til night, til morning
Now tell me whats gonna happen next
One day I'm under
The next day I'm over
Good things can happen when you push it to the limit
Some thinks its so much energy
So call me miss heartbreak cause I know what I need

Its bigger than love
Its better than trust
And you would think that's enough
I'll never give up
Addicted to the rush
I may be young but I'm dangerous

I'm not the girl that used to be
I'm by myself surrounded by my own memories
I can't believe it
It's like a dream
Feels like I'm looking in on the outside of me

My walk (dangerous)
My talk (dangerous)
My style (dangerous)

You're gonna love me

(Dangerous)
Cause I'm (dangerous)
My body (dangerous)

Its bigger than love
Its better than trust
And you would think that's enough
I'll never give up
Addicted to the rush
Dangerous

Its bigger than love
Its better than trust
And you would think that's enough
I'll never give up
Addicted to the rush
I may be young but I'm dangerous
