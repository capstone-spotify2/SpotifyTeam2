Tonight it doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm if inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
You don't even try
That's when you'll find
One that feels right
One for all time
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high

Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Sometimes you beg
Ends up against the wall
As I hold you close
We dance in time
But I think I know the love factor's high

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high
