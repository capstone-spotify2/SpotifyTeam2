Once upon a time I was a young man
always knew what I wanted to do
These times were still the best as I remember
Cause nothing was impossible to me

Then one day I met you and I still wonder
How you could make my dreams come through so fast
I doubted that such a miracle would happen
But you saw something deep inside of me

I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be calling
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be there
I believe in the morning light
Where I know I will see your face again
You will be free, you'll be there

I can't accept the fact that you are gone now
Somehow there is a way just tell me how
I'll stay around as long as it may take you
to turn around and see that I'm still here

I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be calling
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be there
I believe in the morning light
Where I know I will see your face again
You will be free, you'll be there
