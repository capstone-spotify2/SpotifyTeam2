The soft rains of April are over
The soft rains of April are over, over

Anybody home now
I am on the phone now, please...
The soft rains of April are over
The ferry across the water to Dover, over

Anybody home now
I am on the phone, oh I'd like to go back
Is it raining back home
I'm so alone

Just got up today
And my thoughts are miles away
With you

Well, they gave me four years
Three more to go
Keep writing letters
Time's passing so slow

So soft rains of April are over
The soft rains of April are over
Over
