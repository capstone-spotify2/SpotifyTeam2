I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen
I remember my mamma raisin' cane with me
She said, Son tell me why you wanna ride that thing
She didn't know about the blonde at the Dairy Queen

I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to ride motorcycles
And she likes it too
I like to ride motorcycles
And he likes it too

I always wore my hair just a little too long
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to
She wouldn't have had nothin' left to run her fingers through

I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to wear my hair long
And she likes it too
I like to wear my hair long
And she likes it too

I remember ridin' around with my buddies back home
Listenin' to some country on the radio
When they tried to change the station to some Rock 'n' Roll
I'd turn the Opry up just as loud as it'd go

I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like country music
She likes it too
I like country music
She likes it too

Now I got a big Harley
And my hair is still long
And I'm still listening to a country song

I got my own reasons
Why I do what I do
I know what I like
She likes it too
I know what I like
She likes it too
Yeah I know what I like
She likes it too
