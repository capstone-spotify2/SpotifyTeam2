Zooming through the universe - on collision course
A meteor from outta space - gonna smash the earth
Head down to the trenches - to watch the bloody war
Nothing's gonna stop - the metal dinosaurs

Runaway train lost control - a thousand tons of steel
Overheated engines - the screaming of the wheels
A fighter in a boxing ring - takes the final blow
Opponent's on the canvas - lost by t.k.o.

Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail
Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail

From Belfast to Jerusalem - it's the living hell
Tuzla to Afghanistan - fighting tooth and nail
Death is irreversible - no matter what we try
Life is not recyclable - we are born to die

Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail
Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail

He was a teen spirit idol - loaded up his veins
He couldn't stand the pressure - so he terminates his brains
A renegade Red Indian - they called Geronimo
Cracked the white man's head - like the raging buffalo

Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail
Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail

Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail
Dead on - in a head-on collision
Dead on - like the hammer and the nail
