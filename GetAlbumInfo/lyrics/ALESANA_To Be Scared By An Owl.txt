Look at the sky
As the night descends
The rain is crashing down,
I've hit another dead end
Just before I let hope slip away
A shadow is revealed, the devil shows his face

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame,
(I'm to blame)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

Look in my eyes! Am I shaking now?
I am all you fear, have I made myself clear?

Shut your mouth and finish what you've started
Boy, you haven't got the slightest idea
Just who I am and what I do for you
Don't you see that I am trying to save you?
Shut your mouth and finish what you've started

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame,
(No one else)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

<i>[Speaking:]</i>
As the last rays of sunlight fade,
One killer chases another
Through the tangled madness of the city
A flash of steel announces the presence of his quarry
The stage is set, the night explodes...

You killed her, you murderer
You have stripped me of the one that I love
You killed her, you murderer
You have no clue what she's capable of...

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame
(I'm scared to death and have myself to blame)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

You'd better look behind you...
