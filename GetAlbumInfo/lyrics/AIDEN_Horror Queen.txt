She wrote this symphony with plastic sin and
Striking pale blue eyes
It's your dead skin, and my last sunrise
Glorify this cemetery vision
Usher me from this life
I want to see your crimson version of Hell

Horror / Eternally idolize
Horror / Sell your soul for lies
Horror / We've got just one last chance to shine
Horror / I know my Horror Queen won't let me down tonight

Walk alone through a cemetery version of a mile
Hang your skin on nail and
Her vicious smile
Glorify this cemetery
Glorify this holy war we live
I want to see your crimson vision of Hell

You walk beyond the grave awake
I walk beyond the grave and wait.
