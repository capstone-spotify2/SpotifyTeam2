Every day is the same
All they know is my name
'Cause I got nothing to say
No one to save

Conversation arrives
All I know this is time
Counting down in my chest
And they'll forget me

Does anyone care if I'm even there?

Speak up
We're listening
Your silence is crippling
And you're not a nothing
<i>[x2]</i>

All the wonderful things
You can see on a screen
Picture perfect they seem
But what about me

Empty words in my mouth
I've been waiting to shout
'Cause maybe then they will see
Everything in me

Does anyone care if I'm even there?

Speak up
We're listening
Your silence is crippling
And you're not a nothing
<i>[x2]</i>

You're not a nothing
You're not a nothing

You are your story
The messy pages inside your head
You are worthy 
Of our attention
We're listening

Speak up <i>[x4]</i>

Speak up
We're listening
<i>[x3]</i>

Speak up 

Speak up
We're listening
Your silence is crippling
And you're not a nothing
