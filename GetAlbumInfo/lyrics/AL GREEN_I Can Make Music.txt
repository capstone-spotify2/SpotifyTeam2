The first time I kissed your lips, baby
The first time I held you in my arms, hold you, baby
I felt like I could make music, music to dance by
I can make music that won't let you cry

I can make music, music that make you move your feet
I can make music, oh, so complete
I can make music, hey, hey, say you're proud
I can make music, hey, understand

Music you can dance off the wall
Music, all big and small
One more time, now listen here

First time I wanted you, I really wanted you to hold me
Reach out for you sincerely, baby, oh yeah
I felt that I could make music, felt like to me I'll make you shout
I can make music, yeah, hey, what's it all about?

Music dance off the wall
I can make music
Rather neat and small

Hey, music runs right through your soul
Music, music, better take control
Music, music, touch your heart
Music, music, tell me, tell me what's it all about?

Music, I like to eat
I've been given to you pretty good, yeah, oh yeah
I got another music for me, oh yeah
I got another music for you, oh yeah

Sometimes I think I wanna
Sometimes it makes me wanna
My I wanna, music
Anybody hear me feeling music, music

I need somebody here to play a little music
Come on, music, come on, music
Come on everybody now, music
<i>[?]</i> music
Baby, never leave you alone, music

Come on, come on, come on, music
Come on, come on, come on, music
Come on, come on, come on, music
