This is for the one who was false
Who taught me about building walls
One who always could turn it around
To leave me there on shaky ground

This is for the one who made good
In someone else's neighborhood
One who never was anything but
The shifty eye of sheer bad luck

Once I thought that I would never forget
And I have not quite done that yet

But I could hurt you now
I could hurt you now

This is for the time that I lost
The death of who I thought I was
The things in which I cannot believe
For fear I'll wear them on my sleeve

Things I know that never will be returned
But I crossed that bridge before it burned

So I could hurt you now
I could hurt you now
(Listen, sonny boy
You just don't get it, do you?)
I could hurt you now
(I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll get that message to you)

Maybe it leaves an invisible scar
But I have not come quite that far

But I could hurt you now
(Listen, sonny boy
You just don't get it, do you?)
I could hurt you now
(I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll get that message to you)
