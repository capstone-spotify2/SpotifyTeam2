Both of us together in a room by ourselves
I sneeze to look around, but there's no escape
What can I do, what can I say

Me I'm touchy - Touchy you
Me I'm touchy
And you know what to do

Touchy, touchy you
Touching love is the best I can do
Hey, this time you've gone too far
You know how touchy we are
