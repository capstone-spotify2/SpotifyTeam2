In coming

Longing, I've been waiting
Breathless, restless for you baby
Captivated, lost completely
I'm a prisoner of your love

Feel my lifeless body
Waken, taken oh you make me
Lose my patience and I'm rushing
My heart is racing for your love

You and me
There's nothing better
You can make me strong and weak
I never felt so deeply
You control me and I don't even mind

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

Your touch has returned me
From my sleepless dream, you woke me
To another world, you took me
It's a place I never knew existed

Now my heart is open
I'm no longer scared and broken
Like a jot of a lightning, struck me
Cause your love is so electrifying

You and me
There's nothing better
You can make me strong and weak
I never felt so deeply
You control me and I don't even mind

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

Say I'm crazy
But you make me
Make my heart go

I'm obsessive
Oh you got me
My heart racing

My heart racing
My heart racing
My-my heart racing
My-my heart race-racing

My heart my heart my heart
My heart racing
My heart racing
My-my heart racing
My-my heart racing

You and me
Cause without you
I am empty
You control me and I don't even mind

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat, heart beat

You make my hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Hear-hear-hear-hear-heart beat
Heart beat, heart beat
My heart racing
