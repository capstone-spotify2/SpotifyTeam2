I'm hiding in a rain barrel inside these consul walls
This shaft of light is so narrow I can't see much at all
Outside I hear the feet running
And voices all around
Footsoldiers with their guns coming
I can't make a sound

But if Mr. Williams keeps his word
My life could still be saved
I might live to see a time
When all these roads are paved
But if they break inside these walls
You won't see me again
But if Mr. Williams keeps his word
Somewhere, my story will be heard

I'm living in a strange country, it's so hard to find
It's not on any map, you carry it in your heart and mind
Outside I hear the ground shaking up from underneath
It's only when the empire's breaking
That you see their teeth

But if Mr. Williams keeps his word
My life could still be saved
I might live to see a time
When all these roads are paved
But if they break inside these walls
You won't see me again
But if Mr. Williams keeps his word
Somewhere, my story will be heard

I'm hiding in a rain barrel with one small patch of sky
Don't think I'm going to see tomorrow
Going to bid this world good-bye.
