When they come, and they will
They'll come for you?
(They have an army)
We have a Hulk
(I thought the beast had wondered off...)
You're missing the point
There's no throne, there's no version of this where you come out on top

Lemme infiltrate the beat
Concentrate the heat
If you ain't on my level
Fuck it, let me be!
I be goin' till it's all in motion
Talkin killin rappers than I hit my quota
And my train of thought is
More a locomotive
Talkin' reason for it
I got loco motives
Used to be on a revenge tip
On a stunt on my ex and her friends tip
I was spiderman whippin the black suit
I was powerful but almost lost Luke
Blurring the line between human and artist
Try not to change, but I swear it's the hardest
I swear, when you're up, they turn you to a target
Home was a trip, mileage ain't what I'm talkin
So? What it take to be an icon?
All in yo desktop, so I just might already be one
Might meet with a label if deals on the table
Won't sign, but I'm down for a free lunch
Just speakin' my heat seeking missiles of hits
But other than me I see no heat exists

Y'all gassed up, I'm bout to go green
Go green, go green
Hulk smash if she know me
Know me, know me
Write it to life like I'm Stan Lee
Stan Lee, Stan lee
If life's about to be a cold war
I'm the hero that they asked for
Green (I'm about to go, I'm bout to go) <i>[x3]</i>
Get the fuck back, I'm bout to go GREEN!

I might begin makin' a feature a rack
Cuz when I hit your beat I turn shit to Iraq
Droppin' bombs like I'm cursin' you out
This your house, then I'm kickin' you out
Quiet as a mouse, came in the game
Now the word is out that I've been lightin' the flame
Shit is potent, don't ya know it
I been flowin' steady growin' till they know the name
Saw it ahead of time, knew that I'd get to my
Losing myself in the view that's some window pane
I swear I'm all about peace, I'm a positive person
Wasn't always like that, you know it took you some learning
They ask me how I push a positive light
How I keep my composure through internal fights
When addressing the mic through these dark nights
Word to Bruce Wayne well the trick be
Here's some truth that I'll let free
Bruce Banner of rap if you ask me
When my will to win, and the track meet
The secret is I'm always angry

Y'all gassed up, I'm bout to go green
Go green, go green
Hulk smash if she know me
Know me, know me
Write it to life like I'm Stan Lee
Stan Lee, Stan lee
If life's about to be a cold war
I'm the hero that they asked for
Green I'm about to go, I'm bout to go <i>[x3]</i>
Get the fuck back, I'm bout to go GREEN!
