Defy the one
The sinew of defining rage,
The fabric of a dying age,
In solitary madness I have found.

The courage to carry on
You brought the funeral light.
The courage to carry on
And Iâve got the skeleton for love.

Defy the son
The heir will be designing fate,
The errand of our shining hate,
In solitary madness I have found.

Itâs only taken me ten years of fighting faithfully
This cause I can believe in too.
Itâs not misery, life
The love is not me itâs you.

You got the courage to carry on
I got the courage, and some kind of hate.
