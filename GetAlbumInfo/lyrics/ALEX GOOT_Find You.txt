Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance
Just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

High on words, we almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same Achilles heels

Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

Open up your skies
Turn up your night
To the speed of life
Turn up your night
Put your love in lights
Turn up your night
I will find you

Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you
