December falls, 
I don't think I'm okay, 
not today. 
When dad came home, 
he told me "go upstairs", 
I close my eyes, 
a tear falls down, 
as I drop onto my bed. 
Not again. 
My anger hits, 
as I hear mom cry again,
cry again.
Things are confusing I don't know what I should turn to. 
Should I run away?
Dad has gone crazy the last time, 
I think that I might, 
put him in his place. 
I think I just might run away.
I think I just might.
I think I just might run away.
I think I just might..

December falls, 
I forgot it's meaning,
to look to Christ.
I'll help you dad, 
I'll show you there's a meaning. 
Things are confusing I don't know what I should turn to. 
Should I run away?
Dad has gone crazy the last time, 
I think that I might, 
put him in his place. 
I think I should look to my heart
I think I should look to my heart
I think I should look to my heart
I think I should look.. 

December falls,
I forgot it's meaning..
