There's a big, black picture and it's hanging on the wall.
With stars and all the planets, the milky way and all.
And in the left hand corner, perhaps a small white dwarf,
Ready to explode, implode I really can't recall

But it's out there, and I'm down here.
And so far from it all

Everything's expanding in a constant state of change.
Everything's demanding in a constant state of pain.
You radiate away. Your last remaining heat
Your atmosphere has blown away when you admit defeat

But its out there (pal - don't know where we are)
And I'm down here (pal - don't know why we are)
And so far from it all

Your time, your grace, your story in place, your life-span erased

There's a big, black picture and its hanging off your wall
The stars and all the planets, the milky way and all
And in the left hand corner, perhaps a small white dwarf,
Ready to explode, implode I really can't recall.

But its out there (pal - don't know where we are)
And I'm down here (pal-don't know why we are)
And so far from it all.
But I'm out here (pal - don't know where we are)
Down here (pal - don't know why we are)
I'm so far from it all...
