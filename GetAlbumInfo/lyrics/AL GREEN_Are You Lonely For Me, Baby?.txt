Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

Oh, it's our last train, baby, to Jacksonville
I'm gonna get on it, baby, you know I will
Will you try? Go ahead and try
To forget all the pain I brought you

Go on and try, go ahead and try, baby
I know I'm the one who taught you

Yeah, but I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely and blue
Good god, I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you, all alone

Yeah, I'm lonely
Let me, let me say that I'm lonely, baby
Lord, have mercy rain now

It's our last bus to Jacksonville
My sweet baby, are you still?
Tell your friend, it's the end
I will never, never again desert you

He will laugh
I can hear him laughing, baby
And you'd said that I was wrong to hurt you
Oh, but I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry about that, baby

I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you

Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

It's a long ride to Jacksonville
Nobody will ever know the way I feel
Will you be there, will you be there, baby?
When I step down from the train

Will you be there, baby?
You just you got to be there, baby
When it's somebody call my name

Yeah, I'm lonely, baby
I'm lonely and blue
Oh Lord, I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you

Let me, let me tell you that I'm lonely, baby
I want to <i>[?]</i> all night long

Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
