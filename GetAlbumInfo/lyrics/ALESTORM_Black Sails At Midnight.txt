Go - the cold moonlight reflecting off your blade
So many centuries spent waiting for this day
Ride - across the seas beneath a blackened sail
Know that a painful death awaits us if we fail

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late

The time has come for you to face your darkest fears
Screams of agony are ringing in your ears
Die - a frenzied slaughter on the battlefield
Nowhere for you to run, tonight your fate is sealed

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late
