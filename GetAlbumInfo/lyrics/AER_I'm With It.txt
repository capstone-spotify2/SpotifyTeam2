<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Catch me holdin on the OE, conversate with Zoe
Only gonna remember her T-shirt with David Bowie
Its so clear the hipsters here, and the queens are there, and the rest are near
Itâs the FAM crew and were back at it again
This time in a house of a friend of a friends
Only 11 PM, now with your eyes and your ears listen up to how the story begins
The beat brought the energy, I brought the soul
Hope I donât get drowned in liquor and end up runnin home
Got my homies to keep me composed, now thatâs real
And that girl Zoe over there knows the deal

<i>[Chorus - Dave:]</i>
I donât wanna cuff to confine me
Every move you make choose your way (Iâm with it)
Gettinâ loose with crew right beside me
Let me approach what I scoped out (Iâm with it)
Any minute now we can exit the spot
And take what we got home and get acquainted
Lift your brow got me spillinâ out vows
From your style to your smile â love you got me chasinâ

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Lets go! Cmon! time to break up the best smoke
âCarter can I hit it? donât make me kiss ya and beg for it,â
This house so big it needs exploring
So come along girl were diving in head first

I said yeah baby yeah make that granite counter top yours
One more minute and weâll bring it to the bottom floor
Applaud for the encore, and I ainât even on tour
The thunderstorm is coming, I wonder who will conquer?
Thatâs simple itâs me, got the freshest expressions and essence up on my tee
They all askinâ, howâd I end up like Jay Gatsby?

The set up of the place was pretty hot
With a smoking section, dance floor, and a porch to cool off
Barely know her but I know that sheâs rarer than moon rocks
With Cartie in this bitch the party donât stop ha

<i>[Chorus - Dave]</i>
