I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles 
And the heavens open up every time she smiles 
And when I come to her that is where I belong 
And I'm running through her like a rivers song 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And I'm coming to her when the sun goes down 
Take away my troubles, take away my grief 
Take away my heartaches in the night like a thief 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 

And I need her in the daytime (I need her) 
And I need her in the night (I need her) 
And I want to throw my arms around her 
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight 

When I'm returning from so far away 
Gives me some sweet loving, brightens up my day 
And it makes me righteous and it makes me whole 
And it makes me mellow right down to my soul 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
