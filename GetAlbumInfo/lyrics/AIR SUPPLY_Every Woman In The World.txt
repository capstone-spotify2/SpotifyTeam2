Over night scenes, dinner and wine
Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep, waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me, oh

It's such a crazy old town, it can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
I was dancin' in the dark with strangers
No love around me, when suddenly you found me, oh

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Girl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me
You're ev'rything I need
You're ev'rything to me, oh girl

Ev'rything good, ev'rything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine and together
We'll climb as high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in ev'ry minute that we're together
And I'm stayin' right here forever oh

<i>[Chorus]</i>
