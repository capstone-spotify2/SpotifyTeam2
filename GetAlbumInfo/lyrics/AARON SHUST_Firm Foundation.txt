Oh I have found a rock where I can stand
When every other ground is sinking sand
Oh I have found the truth that breaks the dark
And love that mends a broken shattered heart

Oh how firm a foundation
What a comfort and peace
I am found in the arms of
Jesus Christ my King

Thought fiery trials in my pathway lie
His all sufficient grace is my supply
And though sorrow and trouble 'round me rage
He will be my refuge in the flame

Oh how firm a foundation
What comfort and peace
I am found in the arms of
Jesus

Oh how firm a foundation
What confidence He brings
I am found in the arms of
Jesus Christ my King

Fear not He is with us
Oh be not dismayed
Fear not He is with us
Oh be not dismayed

Oh how firm a foundation
What comfort and peace
I am found in the arms of
Jesus

Oh how firm a foundation
What confidence He brings
I am found in the arms of
Jesus Christ my King
