<i>[Intro x4:]</i>
See no evil, hear no evil, boy you better speak my sex

Tic-tac-toe, here we go
Are you ready for an X my O's now
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's knick-knack, paddy whack, give em' all a show
I want it right now
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Boy, you're so fine
You must drink your apple juice
Get yours, get mine
I just wanna' play with
You can touch double-dutch
Got you working for it, up and down now
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i>
Come and get me
Trap me into love

<i>[Hook x2:]</i>
Boy, you better speak my sex
You better speak my sex
Boy, you better speak my sex
My sex, my sex

Hopscotch hoes, all I know
Is I'm better than a sidewalk hoochie
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Paddy cakes throwin' shade cause they're into me
And she's got cooties
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Boy, you're so fine
You must drink your Gatorade
Get yours, get mine
Everybody's gonna' hate
All nice, we're in love
Playin' house with baby Tamagotchis
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
