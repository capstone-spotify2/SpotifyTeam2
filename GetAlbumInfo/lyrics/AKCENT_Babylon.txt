It's Friday,
Friday night
I'm going to make it white
If you're down looking back all the time
You will leave this madness behind
I'll give you tuned,
The rhythm fills your heart!!
Now I realize I'm nowhere to look again
I'm free for life
I'm getting on this plane
Follow the lights
I'm ready to dance again
You're free tonight to take me as I AM
Some days in my life I have enough love by my side
Babylon!
Some days in my life I fall in love with the beautiful life
Babylon!
Some days in my life I have enough love by my side
Babylon!
Some days are for life it gives you <i>[?]</i> from time
Babylooo-oon Babylooo-oon Babylooo-oon
