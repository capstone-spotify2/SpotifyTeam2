Smiles in the morning
As warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And 2 loving arms
To console me
I should be scared, it's so right

But, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on

You look in my eyes
And see my thinkin'
I know when you're happy, when you're sad
Someone said 
It's too perfect
But, I don't think what we have is so bad

Cause, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on 

And we've got a good thing going on
