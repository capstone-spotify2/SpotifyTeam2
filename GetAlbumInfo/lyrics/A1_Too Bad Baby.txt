Too bad baby, can this be, is there something wrong with you and me. 
Guess we'll see I confess I don't know how we got into this mess might have guessed. 
Day by day you're slowly running out of things to say. 
So I may ask you why is it always me who has to try. 
To make things feel right.

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
You never told what you feel inside, I thought you loved me, now I realise. 
No matter how I try
You never seem to be satisfied. 
And now you're tellin' me it's...

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
Too bad baby that you're so good to me, I like you, you love me. 
Too bad baby you're so into me, I can't breathe. 
You fall in love too easily.

Me and you, are slowly running out of things to do, nothing new. 
I don't know, just why we don't agree, when I say YES, and you say NO. 
Don't be shy, please tell why it is that we don't see
Eye to eye
So confused, I'm feeling helpless and I'm feeling used. 
Like yesterdays news, girl

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
<i>[Break]</i>

It started from the day I met her
Walked over me I let her. 
Friends who told me go and get her
They're telling me forget her. 
Too bad baby, Think I'm going crazy. 
Someone take me
Nothings gonna save me.

<i>[Chorus: Repeat Till End]</i>
