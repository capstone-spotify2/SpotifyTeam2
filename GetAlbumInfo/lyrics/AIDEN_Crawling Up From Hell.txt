(Fuck you man
How about that
Fuck you
F, U, C, K  Y, O, U
William Francis)

Sorry that I'm leaving this old place
What's left to say?
The kid became the dream
A legendary nightmare he has won
The sun has set
Every word he wrote he fucking meant

We came, crawling
We came, crawling up from hell

We came crawling up from hell
Demonic versions of ourselves
We came crawling up from hell
We are the nightmare
We are the nightmare in this world

Nightmare!
This nightmare!

Decaying adolescent, human waste
Crawl from the grave
No voice left to scream
From the fire we all cheated death
Have no regrets
Skeletons and ghosts we fought our best

We came, crawling up from hell

We came crawling up from hell
Demonic versions of ourselves
We came crawling up from hell
We are the nightmare
We are the nightmare in this world
