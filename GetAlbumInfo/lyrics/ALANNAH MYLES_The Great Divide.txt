A fever that makes you
Wanna shed your skin
A walking testament to original sin
Gotta good trick up your sleeve
Crocodile daydream, you wanna
You wanna believe

Strike a truce and stand at ease
Or you can choose to slam me to my knees

Cheap resistance, in my way
I wanna become your Independence Day
Give me something for the shape I'm in
Southern comfort oh,
Again and again and again and again

Missionary if you please
I fell from grace and landed on my knees

Welcome to the great divide
Fallen angel stuck inside
All temptation justified

I'm a prisoner baby, with no reprieve
The kind of chaos you can
Count on not to leave

Strike a truce and stand at ease
You can even slam me to my knees

Welcome to the great divide
Fallen angel stuck inside
All temptation justified

And if the money don't get ya
Something will
And if the sex don't get ya, nothing will
Bank of Karma won't loan
Your yin won't yang
The bed don't bang
And the springs don't sprang
Again and again and ahhhhhhhh...

Welcome to the great divide
Fallen angel stuck inside
All temptation justified

Welcome to the great divide, great divide
Welcome to the great divide, great divide
The great divide, great divide
