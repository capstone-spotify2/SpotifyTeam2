I saw your face
And it left me with a taste
Of your lips on my tongue
Oh, it's always been worth it
I know I'm deserving your love

Call me tonight
I swear I won't be here for long
So if you wanna play a game
Or continue just to torn me whole

I saw your face
And it fall
And it fall

Call me tonight
Call me tonight
Call me tonight
Call me tonight

Sweet, sweet perfume
I can't help it
Uncosume
A leaf of your neck
Oh, it's driving me crazy
I can't keep on breaking my back

Call me tonight
Call me tonight
Call me tonight
Call me tonight
