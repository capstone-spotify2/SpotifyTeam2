I enter your life now make no mistake
Can you reach me can you reach me
I enter your life now make no mistake
Can you reach me can you touch me

Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
Can you feel my longing through the night
You've got me totally hypnotized

I came in a black dress and left in a white
Can you reach me can you reach me
I came in a black dress and left in a white
Can you reach me can you touch me

Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
Can you feel my longing through the night
You've got me totally hypnotized

Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
Can you feel my longing through the night
You've got me totally hypnotized

Looking for eyes, the dream is so nice
The rhythm of the song, where you belong
I want is your heart and soul

Hmm, I'm high on emotion you're here with me
You cam reach me you can reach me
Hmm, I'm high on emotion you're here with me
You cam reach me you can touch me

Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
Can you feel my longing through the night
You've got me totally hypnotized

Hypnotized I am hypnotized...
