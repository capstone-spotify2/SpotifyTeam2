You blow my mind, with the things you do to me
Girlie I can't resist your luscious lips caressing my body

How do you keep not from falling
Falling in love, with a girl that can do you
The way you like to be done

You blow my mind with the things you do to me girlie I cant resist your
Luscious lips caressing my body

Takin my time with you girl
Never know when we'll do this again
Taking my time with you girl,
Touching your love stoking you from within 

I hear your voice calling
(baby please pick up the phone)
But I don't wanna answer
I got too many women
So I'm telling you not to fall in love with me

Taking my time with you girl
Never know when we'll do this again
Taking my time with you girl,
Touching your love stoking you from within 

The time is right for you to be
Close to me
Indefinitely
They say good things come to those
Who wait I need to hold you in my arms
