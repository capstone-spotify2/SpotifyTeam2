Golden arches risin' above the next overpass. 
These horizons are endless. 
Americans abroad! 
Americans abroad! 
Profit driven expansion into foreign markets. 
And while I hope I'm not like them, I'm not so sure.

This is the best summer that I've ever had. 
European Vacation, me and my best friends. 
Americans abroad! 
Americans abroad! 
Whatever there is to be said is said in English. 
And while I hope I'm not like them, I'm not so sure. 

Here we are, a rock band looking for new audiences. 
Wherever we go, Coca-Cola's already been. 
Americans abroad! 
Americans abroad! 
And I just can't help but think that there's nothing in sight. 
And while I hope I'm not like them, I'm not so sure.
