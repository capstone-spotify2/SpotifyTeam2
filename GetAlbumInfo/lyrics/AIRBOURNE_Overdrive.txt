Six days and I ain't seen a bed 
I'm hitting overdrive 
I got a death wish I'm over the edge 
On a wild joyride 
Cause it's too much speed and too much booze 
It's a suicide 
Coz with every 2nd wind I can't lose 
I never been so alive 

1st gear and I'm feelin alright 
2nd 3rd 4th 5th never die 

Overdrive foot to the floor 
Overdrive give me more 
Overdrive above the law 
Overdrive It's how I live my life 

Caffeine nicotine and whiskey 
It's barely enough 
Don't need a cue to sink my eight ball 
Coz I only play rough, hard stuff 

2nd wind and I'm still alive 
2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th (then) I'll never die 

Overdrive foot to the floor 
Overdrive give me more 
Overdrive above the law 
Overdrive It's how I live my life 
Overdrive foot to the floor 
Overdrive give me more 
Overdrive above the law 
Overdrive It's how I live my life 

Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive
