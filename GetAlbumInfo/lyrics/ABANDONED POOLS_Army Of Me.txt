Stand up, you've got to manage
I won't sympathize anymore

And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
Army of me

You're alright, there's nothing wrong
Self sufficiency, please and get to work

And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
Army of me, army of me

You're on your own now, we won't save you
Your rescue squad is too exhausted

And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And, if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
Army of me, army of me

And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me, army of me
