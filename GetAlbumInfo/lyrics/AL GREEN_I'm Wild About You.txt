There's always talk about love
What do you know?
I never talk about love
I just like to show

If there's something wrong
You can tell me, I need to see, oh yeah
I talk my talk and I walk my walk
And just you and me

No doubt, hey, hey

I'm wild about you baby
Girl, I'm wild
I'm wild about you baby
There ain't no doubt, oh Lord

There's always talk about things I
I cannot change, oh Lord
There's always moves about things I
I can't rearrange

I'm wild about you baby
You don't know how I feel
Hey, baby
I'm wild about you baby

You're down in my heart
You're down in my mind
You're down in my soul, yeah

Soul, yeah, I love you so much
I wanna take you in my arms and
Take you in my arms and
Take you in my arms and I, I

Moping down about some things I
I can't remake, oh yeah
I'm standing on the one I can depend on
And there can be no games

I'm wild, ability
I'm wild about you baby, yes sir
I'm wild about you
I'm wild about you baby
I'm wild, I'm wild

I'm wild about you baby
Good God see why
Going wild about you baby
You don't know how I feel
