I wake up and first things first
Iâm of service
I make sure your needs are met, as a selfless
I give hard and serve hard and now I, I need a break
I give big, I give all and now itâs time to regenerate

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Todayâs all about me, all about cup filling
Todayâs all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I move on through offerings often one-sided
Being this low on list of worth: over-extended

I give hard, provide hard and now I need some relief
I look out, I proffer, and now I need some respite indeed

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Todayâs all about me, all about cup filling
Todayâs all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

My habit to love you first and me: remainders
Favoring you is so knee-jerk, leaves me a stranger
I give hard, impart hard and now I need to retreat
I give out, dedicate and now I need to acknowledge me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Todayâs all about me, all about cup filling
Todayâs all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
