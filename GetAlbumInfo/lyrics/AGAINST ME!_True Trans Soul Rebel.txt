All dressed up and nowhere to go
Walking the streets all alone
Another night to wish you could forget
Making yourself up as you go along

Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Does god bless your transsexual heart?

Yet to be born, you're already dead
You sleep with a gun beside you in bed
You follow it through to the obvious end
Slit your veins wide open
You bleed it out

Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Does god bless your transsexual heart?

You should've been a mother
You should've been a wife
You should've been gone from here years ago
You should be living a different life

Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Does god bless your transsexual heart?
