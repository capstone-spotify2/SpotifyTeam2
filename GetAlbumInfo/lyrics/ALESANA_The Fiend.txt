Blessed smoke bellows from the beast!
Bow to the gears and worship the machine!

Is it so?
This can't be happening...
Why can't they see?
Seas of children are bound, gagged, and led into the flames...

Blind are leading the blind into a disaster
I'm the only one who seems to care...
If you decide to worship the chaos...
I will not wait and watch as you burn...

All must kneel before the alter, the veiled will be exalted
We are the flock!
They do not hear a word I say
In the God's harbor all shall rest, become part of the master
We are divine!
I can not save them all!

Blind are leaving the blind into a disaster
I'm the only one who seems to care...
If you decide to worship the chaos...
I will not wait and watch as you burn...

Should we go? They all seem so content
We should go and become part of him

I need you to trust me now
Don't move, I'll figure this out
Forget what anyone said
Just take my hand or we'll both be dead

Blind are leading the blind into a disaster
I'm the only one who seems to care...
If you decide to worship the chaos...
I will not wait and watch as you burn...
They'll never be able to see that they crave this captivity...
