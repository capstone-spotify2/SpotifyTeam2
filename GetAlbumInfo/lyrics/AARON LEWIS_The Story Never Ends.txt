Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
And the maples on this road they must be three hundred years old
Just imagine all the stories they could tell
Of the tractors and the cars
All comin' home from Liston's bar
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
To raise some hell

This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends

So I just hit the ground and keep on runnin'
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try to pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way that it belongs
Well the next thing that you know
It's time to play another show
I'm leavin' out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
When you are gone

And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
And my amendment rights
They keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends

This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my amendment rights
Keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends

And the story never ends

Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home
To what I know
