Just give me a reason
To keep my heart beating
Donât worry itâs safe right here in my arms
As the world falls apart around us
All we can do is hold on, hold on

Take my hand
And bring me back, yeah

I risk everything if itâs for you 
I whisper into the night
Telling me itâs not my time and donât give up
Iâve never stood up before this time
Down is not the way we go
I feel a chance so I know that I can't give in

So stand up, stand up (Just gotta keep on running)
Wake up, wake up (Just tell me how I can)
Never give up
These moments of beauty drive me insane

Just tell me why baby
They might call me crazy
For saying Iâll fight until there is no more
Forget how we felt about each other
Itâs time to get over
Blinded I canât see the end
So where do I begin?

Say another word, I canât hear you
The silence between us
Is starting to be louder than the word we scream
I take this chance that I make you mine
Taking in the fears I know, and knowing what I can barely say

So stand up, stand up (Just gotta keep on running)
Wake up, wake up (Just tell me how I can)
Never give up
These moments of beauty makes me somber

Just give me a reason
To keep my heart beating
Donât worry itâs safe right here in my arms
Crying it's time to save the weaker
Reaching for something
So blinded I canât see the end

Look how far weâve made it
The pain I canât escape it
Remember a time when I was on the outs and had nowhere to go
I know now that, no matter how I start I have to play my part
All the way through
So where do I begin?

This hand I've held tightly
To keep it close to me
I can't let it slip through these fingers I'll hold on
It's away with those old days back when I had nothing or no one to lose
I do now

Just tell me why baby
They might call me crazy (crazy)
For saying Iâll fight until there is no more (no more)
Forget how we felt about each other
Itâs time to get over
Blinded I canât see the end

Look how far weâve made it (made it)
The pain I canât escape it (escape it)
Remember a time when I was on the outs and had nowhere to go
I know now that, no matter how I start I have to play my part
All the way through
It finally begins
