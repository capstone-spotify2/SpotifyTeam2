Hang on, don't be frightened, 
Hold on, keep the light on, 
You call me anytime you want to. 
Keep a night in summer, 
Don't cry when its over, 
You take me anywhere you need to. 

Like its your birthday, 
Like on your first date, 

Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 
You're gonna make it in your own way! 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Or you're gonna fall... 

Come on, getting violent, 
Be strong, and don't be frightened, 
That's crazy talk where out from hold you lost this. 
Go where the weather takes you, 
Don't care, they'll never break you, 
Love is all we needed in the first place. 

Like its your birthday, 
Like on your first date, 

Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 
You're gonna make it in your own way! 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Or you're gonna fall... 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Or don't make it at all... 

Days'll never feel the same, 
I get your tears, I feel your pain, 
I know two people that think the same, 
I'm giving you your own way. 

Like its your birthday, 
Like on your first date, 
Like its your birthday, 
Like on your first date, 

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
You gotta make it in your own way! 
Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 
Or you're gonna fall... 
Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 
Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 
Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 
Or don't make it at all...
