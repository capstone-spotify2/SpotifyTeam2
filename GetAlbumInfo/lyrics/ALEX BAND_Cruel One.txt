Love is a cruel one
It's one in a million
Before you know
It'll come and go
By so fast?

I climbed the stairs to your hotel
Knew you were there cause I could smell
Your scent blowing in the winter And I
Opened the door and saw the mess
Among the ruins and distress
I put the pieces back together
Then I found the letter soaked in your perfume
It said you won't be coming back
Anytime soon?

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Love is a cruel one
It's one in a million
Before you know
It'll come and go
By so fast
And hearts can't be empty
It's elementary
Like a warm loaded gun
Love is a cruel one.

And now a baby's grown inside
You took two souls and then stole mine
What did I do to deserve this?
Like a shot in the dark I stumble
Our perfect world has crumbled
I hold you close for our last kiss
Now all the colors that once shined have turned to white
So I close my eyes and dream
Of you tonight?

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Like a warm loaded gun
Like a warm loaded gun
Love is a cruel one
Love is a cruel one?
<i>[repeat until the end of the song]</i>
