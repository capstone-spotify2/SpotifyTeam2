There comes a certain time when we should contemplate
The end of everything familiar as we know it
We will not follow the same path tomorrow as yesterday

Oh the way I slowly lose my mind
It just reminds me I should limit my
Time on selfish things I donât need anyway

I donât know where Iâm going
I donât know where I was
I just know that I need you wherever I end up
And if I lose my head youâll help me see where I should go

As simple as a message to me as can be (as can be)
I only want something to let me know youâre here

Oh the way I slowly lose my mind
It just reminds me I should limit my
Time on selfish things I donât need anyway

I donât know where Iâm going
I donât know where I was
I just know that I need you wherever I end up
And if I lose my head youâll help me see where I should go

If my mind slowly disintegrates into something useless
Will I still have your sweet embrace to keep me company?

Will I have still have that sweet embrace to keep me company?

I donât know where Iâm going
I donât know where I was
I just know that I need you wherever I end up
And if I lose my head youâll help me see where I should go
