5000 letters 
I keep in my bedroom
5000 people
Who open their hearts
Once we were strangers
Today we are family
Mountains won't keep us apart

There is a girl
Who has drawn me aside rise
That's how she once every morning to be
A boy lost his tooth and he wants me to have it
How did this happen to me?

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there 
when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And someday I'll read them again

5000 stories
I keep in my bedroom
5000 secrets
I keep in my mind
I have been given a piece of their lifetime
Friendship is easy to find

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there 
when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And someday I'll read them again

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there 
when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And someday I'll read them again
