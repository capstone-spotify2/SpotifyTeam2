You drive down your old street
Familiar smiles from those you meet
Youâve been around been everywhere
But objects in the rear view mirror
Are closer than they appear

Looking back is bittersweet
When the world was at your feet
Love would make your life complete
No one makes it on their own

Youâve come so far
In your comfortable car
Now objects in the rear view mirror
Seem closer than they are

Looking back is bittersweet
All the world was at your feet
Love could make your life complete
Yeah, love could make your life complete
Teach your heart to skip a beat
Lift your eyes above the street
This is where you once belonged

Come on now, its not so bad
Thinking back on the fund we had
We can stitch a life together
With the fibres of the past
But you cannot make a fleeting moment
Promise it will last

Looking back is bittersweet
Love the world was at your feet
Lift your eyes above the street
This is where you once belonged

Been everywhere
And now youâre here
And objects in the rear view mirror
Seem to disappear
