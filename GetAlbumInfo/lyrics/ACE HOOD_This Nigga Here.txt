50 on some Gucci, 80 on the rag, 100 on some Louis, 100 in the bag
100 and the whole dashboard gold, Platinum on the teeth, cherry red roll
You know the money swole, a nigga neva folds, Presidential sweets, Italian marble floor
20 million on some new shit, new houses, new whips... all new shit
New bitch, mandatory keep a new lick, New clips, hallow tips for the bullets
Stuntin on these bitches see we do this every summer, Pull out the hummers
Calli for the runners, Sun do shine... shine on the sun, make another mil, spend another hundrew
