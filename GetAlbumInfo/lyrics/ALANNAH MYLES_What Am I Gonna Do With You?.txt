Everything happens for a reason
All our rivers run to the sea
Every last emotion has its season
Who knows which one brought you to me?

You struck me like a match
And I had to burn
You found a deeper part of me

What am I gonna do about
The way I feel
How do I shake the weight of everything that I
Have been?
It's so hard to fall after all
That's fallen through
What am I gonna do... with you?

The whole world's hangin'
On this heartbeat
And the angle of your smile
I can only hold back for so long
Lemme know you for  a while

Love is like a flood
And there ain't  no end in sight
Comin' from a deeper part of me

So What am I gonna do about
The way I feel
How can I shake the weight of 
everything that I have been?
It's so hard to fall after all
That's fallen through
What am I gonna do... with you?

What am I gonna do about
The way I feel
How do I shake the weight of everything that I
Have been?
Its so hard to fall after all
That's fallen through
What am I gonna do... with you?

What am I gonna do... with you?
