Everybodyâs got their differences
too bad
hereâs a circumstance in which the stakes are high
everybodyâs got their secrets out
so sad
go around the room and see who doesnât cry

Soon enough
youâll be free to write it off
you donât know enough
to call a bluff
and the one who does
will never ever tell

Soon enough
you can say we made it up
just for fun I guess
to make a mess
cause whatâs more fun
than other peopleâs hell

So go ahead and say youâre done with it
itâs cool
baby you can go whatever way you choose
though you ought to kill the whole vindictive bit
cause youâll
someday realize thereâs ties youâll want to use

Soon enough
youâll be free to write it off
you donât know enough
to call a bluff
and the one who does
will never ever tell

Soon enough
you can say we made it up
just for fun I guess
to make a mess
cause whatâs more fun
than other peopleâs hell
