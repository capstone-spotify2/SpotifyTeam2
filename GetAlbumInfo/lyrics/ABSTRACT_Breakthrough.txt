I'm halfway gone
Sleepless, I'm battle-worn
You're all I want
Bring me the dawn

I've been up for 5 days
Tryna make the grind pay
We just made a project in a month
Word to Blulake

Neverland just hit a milli
Tell me why I'm underrated
Lookin' like we did it
But I swear to God we haven't made it

I'm just spittin' to a mic
That's in the corner of my room
My parents askin' where the money at
I said it's comin' soon

Hope to God I told the truth
Hope ya'll got me on the move
There's only so much I can do

I ain't all about the money
But you know I gotta live
I release my shit for free
There's only so much I can give

An this about to be
The ninth project that I did
Ya'll can hate but hope you know
I done the work to get to this

Good to see us doin' numbers
Word to Blulake, Craig and Drumma
They ain't ready for us

'Bout to turn this to a summer
If they sleepin' snatchin' up on us
Plug it in in numbers
Why they blind to this shit
I don't know ask Stevie Wonder

I need the sun to break
You've woken up my heart
I'm shaking
All my luck could change

Been in the dark for weeks
An I've realized you're all I need
I hope, that I'm not too late
I hope, I'm not too late

I'm only tryna live off, what I live for
I know that's the damn dream
I know I don't need more

'cept for another heart
That I can call my own
Put that shit together
I think I could make a home

Cause I put these words together
Like it's all I've ever known
But I'm yet to get the cheddar
That I know that I been owed

I do this cause I love it
You know it keeps me alive
An always known
I wasn't made to work a 9 to 5

Now I'm more a 9 to 9
Dreamed about it back in 99'
Back seat of my parents ride
Thinkin' music was alive

Hear a couple notes
Somethin' inside you comes alive
Never had to learn it
It's universal to the mind

What a ride
Now I'm movin' to a universal grind
Never lied, couple people hate me
For a couple lines
I don't mind

Seen the way I'm makin' hooks
An throwin' lines, doin' fine
These days I got bigger fish to fry

I need the sun to break
You've woken up my heart
I'm shaking
All my luck could change

Been in the dark for weeks
An I've realized you're all I need
I hope, I'm not too late
I hope, I'm not too late
I hope, I'm not too late
