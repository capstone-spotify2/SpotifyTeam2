<i>[Intro]</i>
Lord forgive âem, for they know not what they do
As I walk through that Valley of the Shadow of Death See no pussyâ¦

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
So I guess we finally meet again
Should I kill âem? Well, that all depends 
Due to success I started losing friends
Nigga sleepinâ, only reason he donât follow trends
Never was a gimmick, the realest in it, come bear witness
And I see them rappers is actors, boy, they so Robin Givens I kept it humble, my stomach grumble, my Rollie tickinâ
They did me dirty, I may forgive âem, but wonât forget it
And not to mention, they wasnât worthy of what Iâm spittinâ
Itâs Godâs will, and them haters just pray they could prevent it Iâm so addicted to gettinâ it, I need intervention
The hottest spittinâ, your favorite rapper scared to admit it
Have mercy, let me bow my head I count a million up, thatâs deadly bread
Ainât no more humble in me, shit is dead
Tell them pussy niggas I ainât never scared
Poor niggas hate to see a nigga win
Say you cominâ for me? Pussy nigga, when?
I been coldhearted since I lost a twin I swear I love it when they hate,
I made a hit again I did this before my niggas, then
Use your bitch whenever like a membership
Never bothered over Twitter beef
Weâll probably never meet up where the money be
Me and Kicko on the woodgrain, yeah, the money seats
Five grand just to see him hit a three Balenciagas on a nigga feet
Death to the competition, may they rest in peace

<i>[Hook]</i>
I know my mama prayinâ for me â I hope your mama prayinâ too
âCause me and my niggas gotta eat â weâll die over these canned foods
Have mercy on a real nigga - âcause Iâm sinninâ every day, Lord
Have mercy on a real nigga - âcause Iâmma ride for my niggas, dog

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
What the fuck these niggas talkinâ âbout?
Load the choppers, bring them problems that they talkinâ âbout
Roll the reefer, no Khalifa, you gonâ ride or die
No homicide, itâs suicide before I testify
Thatâs on my daughter, Iâm runninâ Florida, no kinda, sorta
And I hear âem talkinâ, that money callinâ, them out of order
Yeah, nigga â fuck all that talkinâ, be âbout it, then
A lot of small talk, there they go runninâ their mouth again
Bold nigga, âtil they meet them gorillas
Fuck a cavalry, my niggas ainât got no feelings
Money is the motive, family is the reason
On my mama, ainât nobody ever came between it
And they never will, streets got me grippinâ steel
These scared niggas need to go to church or either
Dr. Phil I tell âem look me in my eyes, we are not the same
Lion-hearted nigga, gunpowder in my veins

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Have mercy on âemâ¦ Bow your headâ¦

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 3]</i>
Pussy niggas still hatinâ hard
Bitch, I just went and bought the boulevard
Bitch, I just went and blew another check
âBout my money, catch a bullet tryna intercept
Jumpinâ up out that whip, I let my chain swing
Blood up on my sneakers like I gangbang
Every dayâs a struggle tryna maintain
And free my real niggas in the chain gang I hear them broke niggas still talkinâ
Watch your words, do be very cautious
You threaten mine, you can pick a coffin
Ainât no talkinâ, tell âem shock it once it go to sparkinâ
Self-made Rollie and a pair of Js Hood nigga livinâ like Iâm Bruce Wayne
New Ferrari kickinâ like itâs Liu Kang Real nigga, ainât it true? 2 Chainz
