Is it her? Could it be? Should my eyes believe what they see?
If you are who I think you are
I might lose my mind.
Just a kiss from her lips
And I would simply float away.
The way her hips sway back and forth,
I've got butterflies.

Dead girls don't just appear out of thin air.
But I am victim to her sinister stare.

Please don't hate me for what I've done
Run away with me, I'll be everything that you need.
Such a pretty girl screams to me.
"Take my hand, take my breath away... "
What if my heart breaks again? (take my breath away)

Just a scent, of her skin
Unlocks forbidden memories.
The slightest gaze of fragile hand
I've got butterflies.

Dead girls don't just appear out thin air.
But I am victim to her sinister stare.

Please don't hate me for what I've done
Run away with me, I'll be everything that you need.
Such a pretty girl screams to me.
"Take my hand, take my breath away... "
What if my heart breaks again?

I'll be your anchor, I'll be your lover.
I'll be your anchor, I'll be your lover.
And then your heart is filled with doubt
I'll bear my soul to you belle!

Please don't hate me for what I've done
Run away with me, I'll be everything that you need.
Such a pretty girl screams to me.
"Take my hand, take my breath away... "

I can't lose you again.
I can't lose you again.
I can't lose you again.
I'm nothing without you.
I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down,
Angel
