Baby talk sweet to me
Blow my mind
Make me feel good, deep down inside
Baby talk sweet to me
Tell me youâre mine
If it feels right
Then Iâm yours tonight

Come sit beside me
Look deep in my eyes
With all of your heart
Come speak your mind
Spent too many nights alone in my bed
But youâre here tonight

Baby talk sweet to me
Blow my mind
Make me feel good, deep down inside

Drowning in red wine
Now you can confide in me
All of your thoughts
Youâre trying to hide
Spent too many nights alone in my bed
But youâre here tonight

Baby talk sweet to me
Blow my mind
Make me feel good, deep down inside
Baby talk sweet o me
Tell me youâre mine
If it feels right
Then Iâm yours tonight
