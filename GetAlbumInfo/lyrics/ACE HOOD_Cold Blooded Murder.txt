Cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder

I got money that you don't know about
Hit the scene and get to showing out
Rock designer you never heard of
Cold blooded murder

Kush got me heavy-eyed
Shoes cost me 35
Doors on suicide
Cold blooded murder

Nigga just got a check
I be so damn fresh
I confess, cold blooded murder
Nigga just got a check
I be so damn fresh
I confess, cold blooded murder

Fucking with me that's in your dreams
My reality ain't a dream
Pull up on them and make a scene
Gotta lower their self-esteem
I'm in a black benz coupe
With a bad bitch too
Smoking cabbage ooh!
S class, fuck school
I been out past 2
Rolling on bout two
Styrofoam getting screwed
VVS I'm the jeweler
That's a cold blooded murder
My attorney gon have to turn up
Margiela's on the feet, Ben Schife on the beat
Python on the seat 10 swords on the beach
True dat, young, nigga, dreaded like a muhfucka
Other nigga's catchin waves, that was last summer
Goofs, oops, got rid of the roofs
In a world full of lies, still speakin' the truth, bzaay!

Niggas like you gon get a nigga name with a casket
If you keep talkin bout my niggas then my niggas gon' pull up 'n get drastic!
I don't play with you nigga's, I don't play with the hoes
I don't play by the money, play it just how it go
Only play with my son, only play with my daughter
Only mention my name, and you know get money the motto
I want them Benjamin Franklins, the big bills and
I know the, foreign appeals to women in heals, they want that
Mula, Mula we got, we got yea, pull up, step out, I'm fly, you not yea
Hoes telling everything comes with therapy, in my good side
Paparazzi got a fetish they french as my genetics, ooh! 
Call the paramedics too pathetic I said it my status got em jealous boy!

You can take a nigga out the ghetto,
