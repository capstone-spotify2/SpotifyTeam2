I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Go on take 'er, I don't need 'er
Kickin' back in my 2 seater
I'm through with ya, I don't remember
Nothin' 'bout ya, amnesia
I moved on, adios
Pop your bottles, make a toast
Whole pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks
You thought that I was gonna save you
Tried to play but I played you
Louie V, D&amp;G
Look at your wheat which I made you
I'm cold hearted, no feelings
My McLaren got no ceiling
Fast life, care down
I'm made of fire, three wheelin'
Panamera, new Ferrari
Paint job, caucasian
Two hoes, half asian
Two mo', Venezuelan
Through with ya, now kick rocks
S1's in my pick top
10 bricks for this wrist watch
It's over babe, straight drop

What the fuck?
Heyo Whoo Kid, run that shit back
God damn

I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Go on take 'er, I don't need 'er
Kickin' back in my 2 seater
I'm through with ya, I don't remember
Nothin' 'bout you, amnesia
I moved on, adios
Pop your bottles, make a toast
Whole pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Money money money man
I got DC's, crockodiles
On both feet, Kai Peters
Livin' life, screwed up
Jump lane for 100 meters
You spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies
But that's bullshit, I'm too fly
My heart cold, I don't feel
Nothin' in it, it paralyzed
Deep and under, I cut 'er off
She know how to treat a boss
I move pounds like Boston George
Get high before I was record
Mark Jacobs on my face
Gator heads on my waist
Makin' more, B-O-T
I pop the trunk but there's lil space
Goin' in on everything
Head first, divin' for it
You playin' games, changin' numbers
And I ain't got time for it
Drop the top, I need head room
Flat screens in my bathroom
I got a red hoe with long weave
With Money Man on her tattoos

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Ai-ain't in love with him, blood sucka
Bleed his Pockets, then burn rubba
You can look, never let him touch it
Think about it all day â Mothafucka
Run over niggas, road kill
Need room to breathe like fishy gills
Give them to you? What's the use
Give them away, goodwill
High heels, TG's
Got that ass movin' in 3D
The riding cure everything's so Breezy
Gotta fight him for me like Rhi Rhi
... heart cold
Third eye, heart froze
Armpits, tagged toes
Beauty and the beast, don't love hoes
That shit, I don't like it
Do anything for a Klondike
Ice-cream but my ice clean
And my cake feels, bon appetite
Devious, French too
Bitch cost, whole thang
Twenty cake in my bustier
38 in my villa rang

Consider this Evil Empire thing as a threat
