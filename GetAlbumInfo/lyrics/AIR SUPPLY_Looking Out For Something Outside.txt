Won't you think about it
Do you know that it's easier said when it's done
We're all in this together
I'm not asking too much
Just some time to stay for as long as you can
It's already tomorrow

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Looking out for something outside
I'm sure you can give me the answer
Won't you say you'll give me some time
That's all I can ask for an answer

Everybody's leavin' won't you try to let me show you how
Put some weight on your shoulders
Everybody knew your eyes were searching around the room
Till I saw you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

What am I to do
What am I to do
When she turns me down
Just give up on you
Can't stop all I need to the ground
What am I to do
What am I to do
When she turns me down
Just give up on you

<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
