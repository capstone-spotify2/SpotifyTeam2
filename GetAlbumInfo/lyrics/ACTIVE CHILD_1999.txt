I think about you all the time
Wonder if when you think of me you smile
Because from the moment we met it was out of our hands
I know

So the story goes
Man and a woman linger alone

Thinking that you're all that
Unaware of this life that we're living
Thinking that you're all that
Unaware of with this life that we're living

Tell me, do you know?
When I'm looking out, rip through soul
Looking out, rip through soul
Sit back and let the days unwind
Somewhere between now and 1999
And back in that time I was only a boy
Soon a man, jumping free
Now it's gone

So the story goes
Makes you want to lay down
With the one that you love

Thinking that you're all that
Unaware of this life that we're living
Thinking that you're all that
Unaware of with this life that we're living
