I'm just a white girl
From a small, safe town
What could I possibly know about destruction?
My lawn sure looks green today
Underneath these suburban skies
But the little boy next door wants to be the Lord of the Flies

It's like Cain and Abel and the holy sacrifice
And I have to believe that God has closed his eyes
And if there is no Avalon and we only have one life
It's hard to conceive why we let our brothers die

My bed is so safe here
And my rose-colored glasses, they're broken
And how the truth leaks in
And I, I can't imagine
I saw it on the news tonight
That they'd announce his name
I saw the blood on his hands
And they told me to look away

I tell ya it's like Cain and Abel and the holy sacrifice
And I have to believe that God has closed his eyes
And if there is no Avalon and we only have one life
It's hard to conceive why we let our sisters die

Why, why?
Why?
It's a confuse civilization, darling

I tell ya it's like Cain and Abel and the holy sacrifice
And I have to believe that God has closed his eyes
And if there is no Avalon and we only have one life
It's hard to conceive why we let our people die
We let 'em die
And watch them die
