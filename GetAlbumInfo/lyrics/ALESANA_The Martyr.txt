Remember why youâre here

Fall for me
Lay yourself before the demon
Spread your legs, bite your lip, meet his eye
Drooling, engorged, wide eyed, shaking, youâve got him
Donât fall for me
Donât relent invite him to you
Guide his hand, take his breath, consume him
Gasping, lusting, weakened, frozen, youâve won
If you should peek beneath the veil
Donât be surprised to find me there

Iâm ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Iâm flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession

Please donât forget who he is, my âBel.
A monster who enjoys the fear
Never forget what he is, my âBel
A monster who designed the fear

Listen to me, keep your focus
Your one true love waits in anguish

Lick your lips as the sweat drips down
and taste the torture as you crawl, begging for more, yea!

Iâm ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Iâm flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession

Remember why youâre here

Iâm ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Iâm flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession
