Tell me what you need
Throwing signs I can not read
Something's wrong
How can we move on?
You're not a heart breaker
But you're making my world break
You world shaker

You gotta dig deep
'Cause your mind just screams
And I can't sleep
Cannot sleep

Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
Speak to me, give me a sign
Won't you just, won't you just
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind

You used to talk all the time
Share your thoughts, ten to the dime
Something's changed
Now you're acting strange
I know that you care
When I speak, you just sit and stare

I gotta dig deep
'Cause your mind's running wild and
And I can't sleep
Cannot sleep

Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
No, you don't have to walk away
You said you never would
I never hear a word you say
Don't speak when you should
Speak to me, tell me what you need
Won't you just
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind

Cannot sleep
I can't read your mind
Cannot sleep

Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
No, you don't have to walk away
Said you never would
I never hear a word you say
Don't speak when you should
Speak to me, tell me what you need
Won't you just
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind
