A few words of inspiration
This song is dedicated to hustlers standing on the curb
Smokin' herb, movin' weight from the inner city to the suburbs
Paranoid of jail, pocket full of ya'll, just waitin' on another sale
Sip your beer, wipe your tears
Encourage your peers, it's gonna be alright

Everything is gonna be alright, sell your dope
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner, they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope, keep on hustlin' till your money's right

You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pocket's tight
You can't find a job 'cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother, you know this world ain't right

Hey, whattup lil' inchworm
I hope this letter make you feel just a lil' bit better
Got your T-shirt picked your khakis creased
So you can be G'd up when you get released

Me and my homeboys put together some Jimmys
To buy some beer and a couple of strippers
You can use my car till you find another
Can't wait till you get home

But later on, that money you get from your GR check
Should be enough to put you back on deck
Now I know, you on parole but don't be scared
This time, we be prepared

Fuck the feds, don't say shit to your broad
Keep your dope stashed in your neighbors yard
When they kick in the door with they steel toed boot
Won't find nothin' but a lawsuit, baby, baby

Everything is gonna be alright, sell your dope
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner, they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope, keep on hustlin' till your money's right

You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pocket's tight
You can't find a job 'cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother, you know this world ain't right

Your baby momma, she might trip
'Cuz you hangin' with a Crip tryin' to clock your grip
She can't help a black man out
But when bills come around, she's got her hand out

The baby needs Pampers and Similac
Plus you need rims for your Cadillac
Ignore your girl when she starts trippin'
Keep them kilos flippin' Dayton's dipin'

We can expand by a little land
Hand the dope game down to the next man
Buy a little business clean the money
Look at the cops funny, hey hey hey

Frontin' in your Caddy or a beat up Taurus
Got the baby gangsters sellin' shit for us
We can dance underwater and not get wet
Sell crack on the internet but not yet

Everything is gonna be alright, sell your dope
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner, they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope, keep on hustlin' till your money's right

You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pocket's tight
You can't find a job 'cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother, you know this world ain't right

Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope, keep on hustlin' till your money's right
You and your girl argue every night

Sell your dope especially when your pocket's tight
You can't find a job 'cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother, you know this world ain't right

1, 2, 3, 4 breakdown

Early in the morning when I get outta bed
I chop up some quarter pieces and get ready for my cluck heads
I sell it all day baby, you sell it all night long
Till the 15th comes around and everybody is all gone

I go out and buy some activator turn my fro into a jheri curl
Put the Daytona's on my lac and then I go scoop up my little girl
Baby, don't try to change me if I go to the pen
'Cuz when the white man lets me go
I'm gonna do the same old thing again

Everything is gonna be alright, sell your dope
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner, they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope, keep on hustlin' till your money's right

You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pocket's tight
You can't find a job 'cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother, you know this world ain't right
