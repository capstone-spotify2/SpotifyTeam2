We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a-comin' all we do is just a-grin
Said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in

Tell me who you know and I'll tell ya who to
Go see my friend, he'll set you free
Tell me what you need and maybe I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me
Nobody goes there, nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah

Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to ya
What is the story?
And what's been goin' through ya?
Livin' like a king off the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin', we're getting out
We're movin', without a doubt
We're movin', we're goin' far
We're movin', oh, yes we are

'Cause nobody goes there, nobody shows there
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows there, nobody shows there
Nobody knows where you can find me
No, no no no no, it's all comin' down on you, yeah
Now now now oh

Level with God and you're in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself and you'll hear what you wanna know
Gotta rise above 'cause below it's only gettin' worse
Life in time will take you where you wanna go

Yeah, where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going?
Ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh, oh oh, come on

Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to ya
What is the story?
And what's been goin' through ya?
Livin' like a king off the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin', we're getting out
We're movin', without a doubt
We're movin', we're goin' far
We're movin', oh, yes we are, 'cause

Nobody knows where, nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows where, nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me

Well, down and down, 'round and down
Better catch your mama so you know where I'm goin'

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a-comin' all we do is just a-grin
Said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in, hey
