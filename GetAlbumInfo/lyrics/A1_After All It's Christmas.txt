I feel the joy in this Christmas time
But something's missing in this heart of mine
The Choirs sings that the season's here
I always miss you this time of year

It's crowded out in Trafalgar square 
But it feels so empty when you're not there
They're all waiting for snow to fall 
But I'm still waiting for a miracle

I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time

If New Year comes and my gifts still there
The lights come down and the tree is bare
I'll keep it wrapped til December then
I'll place it under the tree again

I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time

Christmas morning finally 
I run downstairs excitedly
Then to my surprise I see
The greatest gift in front of me

You left your heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas 

You left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
