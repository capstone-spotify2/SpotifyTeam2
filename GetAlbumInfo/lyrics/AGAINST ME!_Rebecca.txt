I woke up next to you in bed
Already thinking when can I see you again
I swear I won't come on so strong
I can be gone when you want me to be gone
I can come when you want me to come
I can come when you want me to come

Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca

I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, but let's not fall in love
I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, let's not fall in love

And if I had known the address
I would have taken a cab instead
I had to run just to make it in time, to leave again
You don't have to forget to move on
Maybe just a good couple casual fucks
Maybe just a good couple casual fucks

Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca

I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, but let's not fall in love
I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, let's not fall in love

Want you to hit me like a bus
And then I'll get right the fuck back up
Step out in front of the next coming one

Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca

I don't care if you can't stay
I know it never really works that way
We don't have to fall in love
We can just have fun

Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca

I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, let's not fall in love
I don't want to stand here next to you
And pretend there's something I don't want to do
When I just want to grab you by the skull
Rebecca, kiss me, let's not fall in love

No, I don't want to fall in love with you
