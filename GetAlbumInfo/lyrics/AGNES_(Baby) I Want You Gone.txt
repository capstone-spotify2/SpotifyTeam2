I've got love, a good life 
Everything is alright 
What do you want from me? 

You always try to bring me down 
Could it be jealousy? 

<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i>
Everything I do is not good enough 
from your perspective 
Boy, I'm wrong... Noooo!!! 
You say you still believe in us 
You're just pretending 
as if I don't know... but I know (oh, oh)!!!! 

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
When you see me, please don't talk 
You've said it's all my fault 
I'm hurting and you're the cause 
Baby, I want you gone!!!! 
It was over from the start 
Played games with my heart 
You've gone way to far 
Baby, I want you gone!!! 

I'm young, it's alright 
I need to grow without you, can't you see 

So I'll say goodbye to all the heartache 
and the misery 

<i>[Pre-chorus + Chorus]</i>

No more debating 
Got nothing to prove anymore, anymore 

Now we've both reached the finish 
We're done and we're through 
Time to go, you should know 

<i>[Chorus (2x impro/variation)]</i>
