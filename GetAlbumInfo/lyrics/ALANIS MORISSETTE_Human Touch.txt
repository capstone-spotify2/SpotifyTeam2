Give me what I'm askin' for
Stop bringin' me down or I'll slam the door
You're getting out of line with the Beverly Boys
You start makin' the moves they start makin'
the noise

You know you're not getting lucky
livin' the life because you're movin' to
the jungle and paying the price
You're livin' right along with the 
New Brady Bunch

Have your people call my people and let's do lunch
Reaction to the actin there's more to me
than human flesh
I've had enough distractions I need some tenderness

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Human Tough I gotta know it's real
I'm tired of people sellin' their sex appeal
Human Touch I need human love
no imitations of oh baby

A bird in the busy is worth two in 
the street-you know the kind of people
never want to meet you're sitting really
pretty in your swimming pool with your
rock 'n roll tan you keep thinkin' you're 
cool

You know you can't reach Jesus on your
portable phone he ain't speakin' to the people
in their Hollywood homes with a toot
in your snoot and your loot to boot
you don't even give a hoot about the
minds you pollute

Lookin' for deceptions there's more to me
than human flesh I'm finding new
directions I need some tenderness!

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

I'm lookin' for the real thing there's more
to me than human flesh I'm gonna
stop at nothin'

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

You can't reach Alanis on her portable phone
it'll be ringin' off the hook 'caus nobody's home...
