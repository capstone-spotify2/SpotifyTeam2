Dark cloud rollin' outside my window.
Thunder rumblin' in a minor key.
It made me remember my Mama, my Mama's smile
She said mind what you thinkin' and
There are places you should
And places you should not be

Workin' on fifth round down at Shelley's
Now if you shoot six the seventh one's free.
I can't be the last one to leave here again tonight.
I was lookin' at number seven when you
Walked in and brought a light

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
I was in the wrong place at the right time
The devil had an arm around me,
But your sweet heart found me &amp; I must 'a been prayin' right
I was in the wrong place at the right time, child.
You took a three time loser and you turned him around
Lost and found.

I don't mean to overglorify you
Or make you somethin' that you cannot be
But if you could do me just one favor would you child
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in
And rescued me.

<i>[CHORUS x1]</i>
A heart recovered.
What a sight to see.
Would you believe what your love has done for me?
You were good to me.
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in and rescued me?

<i>[CHORUS TO FADE]</i>
