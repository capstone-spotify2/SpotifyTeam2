<i>[Anybody Killa]</i>
There's a party goin' on, who's comin' with? 
To kill the rest of that warm 40, and grab ya shit 
I hope you got some money, cause I ain't got your back 
Especially how cheap you was on the chronic sack 
There's a party at the liqour store, 
don't be claimin' broke 
Actin' like a cold 40 ain't good on the throat 
Who you think that you foolin'? Cause it sure ain't me 
Should'a borrowed five dollars from your old lady 
Is there anybody's cup as empty as mine? 
Pile into the Hoo-ride, seats recline 
Stop at the weedspot, order up another 
This is how we do it, MUTHAFUCKA 
CD burned full of old school tracks 
On the corner of the party store shootin' some craps 
If this is something that you normally see 
then you probably live close to me 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party 
Anybody! 
Party 
Everybody! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 

<i>[Colton Grundy]</i>
I showed up, showed up 
Khaki's creased 
And a chicken head hangin' on either side of me 
Sendin' me to the store 
To cop some 40s 
And I take my time, and make my way around the party 
See my boy JD, and the weedspot on wheels 
65 Impala, drop top, and make the shit hop 
Come on out, sparks the blunt, with two bitches 
Then came through the skunk, we got fucked up! 
Seconds passed, the chicken heads came back 
Now it's off to minglin' and see who else up in the shack 
The music started bumpin', there ain't no sign of the pigs 
If there was, I'd pull my shit and split they fuckin' wigs 
I'm high as fuck, and stumblin' off six 40s 
By the time I see my homie, ABK, up at the party 
Chillin' with seven hoes and they sell toes 
Or they dream about sex and those in birthday clothes 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party 
Anybody! 
Party 
Everybody! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 

<i>[Anbody Killa]</i>
When I got there, shit was tight 
So I rolled up a blunt of that chocolate tie 
Everybody was chillin' out front, sayin' "What's up?" 
Walk in to grab a 40 as I spark my stuff 
Went straight to the back where the brew be at 
Grabbed a cold 4-0 and proceeded to crack 
Gotta dollar fifty sub and a bag of Better Made chips 
Phone number from the hot bottle return bitch 
It was a good day, perfet day to party 
Hot bangin' bootyliscious freaks actin' horny 
Man, this party store is kinda like the club 
Besides the bums comin' in, cause the beer's cheap enough 
I was gettin' my groove on, big straight pimpin' 
Aisle of the party store, Bud Light sippin' 
I heard a gunshot, my drink dropped 
I coulda swore it was the fuckin' cops 

<i>[Robbery noises]</i>

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?! 
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?! 
There was a robbery 
A robbery? 
Someone got shot 
He got shot?! 
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?!
