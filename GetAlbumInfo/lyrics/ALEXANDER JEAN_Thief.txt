There you are
Like the man of my dreams
There you go
Saying all of the right things
I'm just a girl
At least that's what you think
If love's a crime I'll rob you blind

You hunt your prey like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you wanting more
But baby I got you beat, got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking thief
A heartbreaking thief 

Try and go
If you think you can escape
But my claws
Are in too deep for you to get away
You're in control
At least that's what you'll say
Cause we both tell the story different
You were mine from the beginning

You hunt your prey like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you wanting more
But baby I got you beat, got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking thief
A heartbreaking thief 

You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn!

You hunt your prey like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you wanting more
But baby I got you beat, got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking thief
A heartbreaking thief...
