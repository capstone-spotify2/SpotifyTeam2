As the water drips from the sky, I start to wonder.
If I'm still alive then I have to find the answer.
Could it be that it was a dream, and I'm still beside her?
Right before my eyes such a big surprise, the water stops.

Wickedness will rain, and drown us in her.
Sorrow (in her thoughts)
If I hope to survive, I must think faster.
I'm losing ground.
Should I pull back the veil.
You had the best of me (now taste the worst).
All that glimmers is not gold.

I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness.
You had me convinced that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface.
And your body is your masquerade.
Your body is an illness.

Temples crashing down all around me.
Panic clears the streets
The golden city falls.
And with it our lives go up in flames.

Should I pull back the veil.
You had the best of me (now taste the worst).
All that glimmers is not gold.

I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness.
You had me convinced that together we would fly
Until I started scratching at the surface.
And your body is your masquerade.
Your body is an illness.

(Who shall be made clear?)
(Hear them watching you, under.)
My blood runs cold.
(There's no need to fear our love.)
I feel alone from you
(Choose me or you will be left, abandoned)
(Will somebody shout? Is there anybody right?)
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Yeah!

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

I pull back the veil.
You had the best of me (now taste the worst).
All that glimmers is not gold.

I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness.
You had me convinced that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface.
And your body is your masquerade.
Your body is an illness.

And I'm sickened by the thought of you!

I may never be the same again
