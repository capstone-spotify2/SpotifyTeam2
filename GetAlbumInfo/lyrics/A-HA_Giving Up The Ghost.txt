Icy road, blinding dark
Rolling hills in the distance
Open wound, a painful scar
Love has left its burning trademark
Off the grid, out of bounds
Further down into shadow
Darkest day and whitest night
In harm's way
We're chasing rainbows

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
That's what hurts the most

You sever all my heads
You place them on your bed
Some part of your great scheme
To vow me into silence

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
That's what hurt the most

Frozen lake soon will flow
Frozen ground soon to follow
But hey - everything is in your head
And what you killed is never dead

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
On what you loved the most

On a coal-black sea, the sky's on fire
Failed attempts at a funeral pyre
Deep as dreams of dark desire
The flames are growing ever higher

You sever all my heads
You place them on your bed
Some part of your great scheme
To vow me into silence

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
That's what hurt the most
