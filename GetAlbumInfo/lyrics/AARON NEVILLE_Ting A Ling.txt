Well now I'm just a poor young boy
And these girls 'bout to drive me wild
Yeah I'm just a poor young boy
And these girls 'bout to drive me wild
Yeah I-I'm just a poor young boy
And these girls 'bout to drive me wild
The way they rock and roll and call me angel-child

The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh, and si-i-ing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling

Oh well, I'm young and I'm free
And it's a real fine way to be
Yeah I'm young and I'm free
And it's a real fine way to be
Yeah I-I'm young and I'm free-ee
And it's a real fine way to be
I want a fine young girl that is so nice and free

The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh, and si-i-ing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling
