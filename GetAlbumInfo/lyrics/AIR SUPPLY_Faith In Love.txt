There will come a time that is yours and mine
When you must define your faith in love

You may hesitate and say it's too late
But you won't escape your faith in love

When you're reaching out through the slightest doubt
Then it's time to shout your faith in love

And you can curse my name and say I'm to blame
But you'll never tame my faith in love

And your wounded heart will moan
It will sink just like a stone
To the brink of the unknown

And your wounded heart will moan
It will sink just like a stone
To the brink of the unknown

There will come a time that is yours and mine
When you must define your faith in love

You may hesitate and say it's too late
But you won't escape your faith in love

And there's no sweeter taste, no more time to waste
When you're face to face with faith in love

My faith in love
My faith in love
My faith in love
