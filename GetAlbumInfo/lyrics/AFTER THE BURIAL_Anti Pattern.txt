I am a shadow slipping into the abyss
A part of me that will never leave
Just to remind me of who I have grown to be
Pulling me side to side
It won't forget me

I'm watching where I step
So I don't fall between the cracks
An anti-pattern in disbelief

I can't convince myself to be better than I am
I am the watcher
This is a severance
We are waiting for the signs

It'll take more than fortune and shooting stars
To keep me from falling
I unwrap myself
I dissolve

Into one-thousand pieces

I am a shadow 
Slipping into the abyss
A part of me. Never leave.
