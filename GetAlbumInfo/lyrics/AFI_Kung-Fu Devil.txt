It's said and done, there is no turning back.
I've made my choice, now I've gotta face the facts.
Within myself, the hunger won't be subdued,
because I can't have my cake and eat it too.
I'm worn down from fighting with myself.
I'll save my life and lose my mental health.
I'm wigging out, everything is turning round.
A bitter taste-no comfort can be found.
An emptiness wells inside of me, there's no filling the void that will always be.
A self-control is all I have to hold.
It's been too long.
Maybe I have been to bold.
When you're by your own
conviction discipline can be your addiction.
I'm worn down from fighting with myself.
I'll save my life and lose my mental health. I've gone
this far so I'll keep trying.
Continue to fight, I hope that I don't end up dying.
