Well if you're lookin' for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're lookin' for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed
I'm as cool as a body on ice
Hotter than a rollin' dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ain't foolin'
Can't you tell

I'm a live wire, I'm a live wire, I'm a live wire
Gonna set this town on fire

And if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans
Oh come on honey you got nothin' to lose
You got the thirst 'n I got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I wanna make you fry

I'm a live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Holy smoke and sweet desire

Like a hot rod baby?
Oh stick this in your fuse box

Aah cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than a rollin' dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're gonna burn tonight

I'm a live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
And I'm gonna set this town on fire

Live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Well I'm your live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
You're gonna burn
Ah look at me, guilty
Soak my circuit
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
