I've fallen down
Joan of Arc ailing, systems are failing the mission
They've been taken down
Wind from my sails, my tempers that flair and were vicious

I'm going down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down

Unless we start a revolution
Awaken from this frozen
Start the mending of our union
Today

Unless we revive this constitution
From sure disintegration
Live out this revelation
Today

Smile upside-down
Rupture is rising, families are scrambling for custody
Faithlessly drowned
The chase of this dollar is tilting my altar toward apathy

We're going down, down, down
We're going down unless we move to new ground

Unless we start a revolution
Awaken from this frozen
Start the mending of our union
Today

Unless we revive this constitution
From sure disintegration
Live out this revelation
Today

Warmed by this fire
Born from a flicker, my heart moves slower than technology
This dampened desire
Is rolling its sleeves up, replaced by a vigor and empathy

I'm reaching and higher and higher
I'm moving up and up and up
And up, oh

As we bandy our solution
Celebrate our revolution
That antidotes our stations
Today

And as we activate our nation
As we're joined by our companions
We ignite our generation
Today
