No more care-free laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house,
Tears in my eyes
Is this where the story ends?
Is this goodbye?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Memories (memories), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)
They'll be (they'll be) with me (with me) always (always)

In this old familiar room,
Children would play
Now there's only emptiness,
Nothing to say

<i>[Chorus x 2]</i>
