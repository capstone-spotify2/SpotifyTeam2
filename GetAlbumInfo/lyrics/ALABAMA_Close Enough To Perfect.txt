Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong.
And Sometimes what she says she says all wrong.

Right or Wrong, she's there beside me,
Like only a friend would be!
And that's close enough to perfect for me.

Now, She's been known to wear her pants too tight.
And drinkin' puts her out just like a light.
Heaven knows she's not an angel,
But she'd really like to be.
And that's close enough to perfect for me.

She kisses me each mornin'
And smiles a sleepy smile!
She don't have to say it.
I can see it in her eyes!

Don't you worry about my woman,
And what you think she aught to be!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

Sometimes she gets down and starts to cry!
But then again a lady has a right.

She's everything I ever wanted!
She's all I'll ever need!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

She kisses me each mornin',
And smiles a sleepy smile!
She don't have to say it.
I can see it in her eyes!

Don't you worry about my woman,
And what you think she aught to be!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

Whooooa... She's close enough to perfect... for me!
