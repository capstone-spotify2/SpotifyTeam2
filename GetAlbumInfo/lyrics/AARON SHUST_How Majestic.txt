Far beyond imagination
No mortal mind can comprehend
Evidenced throughout creation
Your rule and reign will never end

Oh, Lord, how majestic is
Your great name alone in all the earth
Oh, Lord, Your magnificent
Ge enthroned in praise in all the earth
In all the earth

Lesser names far for Your title
King of kings is Yours to claim
Gathered here in awe and wonder
We cry out in glad refrain

Oh, Lord, how majestic is
Your great name alone in all the earth
Oh, Lord, Your magnificent
Ge enthroned in praise in all the earth
In all the earth

Forever and ever You are holy, so holy
Worthy of all praise, worthy of all praise
Forever and ever You are sovereign, all sovereign
You will not be tamed, You will not be tamed
Forever and ever You are holy, so holy
Worthy of all praise, worthy of all praise

Oh, Lord, how majestic is
Your great name alone in all the earth
Oh, Lord, Your magnificent
Ge enthroned in praise in all the earth
In all the earth
