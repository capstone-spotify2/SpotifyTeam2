I could be daydreaming but for a moment
And somehow they're creeping back in
I could be sleeping awakened the torrent
Somehow I get caught in their grips again

And here I am in my shame spiral
I'm sucked in to it again
And I reach out for your benevolent opinion
And you bring the light back in

Don't leave me here with all these critical voices
Cause they do their best to bring me down
When I'm alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down

I could be listening to a conversation
The story I'm not even in
These voices have their way when I am unguarded
Suddenly I step in quicksand again

Once again in my shame spiral
I am glad that you've weighed in

Don't leave me here with all these critical voices
Cause they do their best to bring me down
When I'm alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down

All these judgements, so incisive
Voices left to their devices
This moments narratee is a desperate plea
For slack to be cut to me
Cut to me

Don't leave me here with all these critical voices
Cause they do their best to bring me down
When I'm alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down
