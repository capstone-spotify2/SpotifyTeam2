I make a getaway
From the day to day
Above the city of lights
There's a party going on tonight
We're mixing sugar and spice
The Champagne's on ice
The sky rise is alive tonight

Party in the Penthouse
At the top of the town
It's a party in the penthouse
Shake it to the ground

The cop's a bangin' on the door
But up here there's no law
We got an endless mini bar
There's a television on the squad car
We're mixing sugar and spice
The slab of Vie's on ice
The sky rise is alive tonight

Party in the Penthouse
At the top of the town
It's a party in the penthouse
Shake it to the ground
Oh yeah

We're gonna shake, shake, shake, shake it baby

I'm flat on my face
I'm a big disgrace
Washed away like a sin
Suddenly I get a second wind
In a beer can paradise
That never ever runs away
The sky rise is alive tonight

Party in the Penthouse
At the top of the town
It's a party in the penthouse
We're gonna shake it to the ground

Party in the Penthouse
At the top of the town
Party in the penthouse
Shake it to the ground
