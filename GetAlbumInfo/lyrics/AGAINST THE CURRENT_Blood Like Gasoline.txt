You're so bad for me
And I know it
But here I am in your arms
And, yeah, we're quiet like a secret
But it's just the calm before the storm

Cause baby, your lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
Your lips like fire

Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline

Your voice follows like an echo
Won't someone wake me from this dream
The bluest skies turn to black clouds
And the wind is drowning out my screams

Cause baby, your lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
Your lips like fire

Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline
Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline

Late at night, telling me "if I was a rose
You'll be the thorns and you won't get better"
But I say "baby, you're more like a stab"
Stand in the rain cause I like the weather
Even though when we're done know I've left these ashes

Baby those lips like fire
My blood like gasoline
Sparked the fire
That burned down everything

Lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
Your lips like fire

Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline
Ignite my gasoline

Cause baby your lips like fire
Left burns all over me
