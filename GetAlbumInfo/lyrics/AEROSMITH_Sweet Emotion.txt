Sweet emotion <i>[2x]</i>

Talk about things and nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're callin' my name, but I gotta make it clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year.

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up &amp; went.
Well, I got good news: she's a real good liar
'Cause a backstage boogie set your pants on fire.

Sweet emotion <i>[2x]</i>

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far.
You're tellin' other things, but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died.
Yes it did.

Standin' in front just shakin' your ass.
I take you backstage you can drink from my glass.
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your hand.
