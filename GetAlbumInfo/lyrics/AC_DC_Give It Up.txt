Well there be no words of fighting around here
'Cause nothin' don't matter 'cause it ain't clear
Well it could be on a Monday
Or it could be even Sunday
So if you can't stand the distance
You better disappear
Do I make myself clear

I'm ready to rock I'm gonna rip it
Ready to rock yeah I'm gonna stick it

Give it up give it out
Whip it up all about
Stick it up shout it loud
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

Well there's a big storm a howlin' around here
And there be no wine no sinnin' and no beer
I'm gonna aim to fire a rocket
There ain't no damn way to stop it
I got a sure fire bullet
To get you outta here
I said do I make myself clear

I'm ready to rock yeah I'm gonna rip it
Ready to rock yeah I'm gonna stick it

Give it up give it out
I said whip it up all about
You gotta stick it up shout it loud
Come on, give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

I'm going crazy on a wild man's night
Take your pick of anything you like
Give it up
Give it up

Sitting pretty on the ready to bite
Givin' up a bit of cream delight
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up

Give it up give it out
Whip it up all about
You gotta stick it up shout it loud
Give it up all around (givin' it up)
Give it up, give it up, give it up (givin' it up)
...(givin' it up)
Stick it up, stick it up, stick 'em down (givin' it up)
Give it up all around
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Givin' it up, stickin' it up
Givin' it up, givin' it up

Give it up
Do I make myself clear?
