Angelina have you seen her
First bench left of the grove
You could be her Angelina
It won't make it better though
She don't mind she don't mind
You're staring but she's looking right through you
Close your eyes step outside
Maybe there's a better view

On the other side
We're all killing time
When it all leads to Rome
Don't pretend you know what lies
Behind those eyes

Cause you've seen her seen her seen her
Angelina oh no
You could be her be her be her
Angelina oh no

Angelina in the street light
You never seem to find your way home
Angelina why did we leave her
I know she had further to go
And I don't mind don't mind
You're staring but she's looking right through you
Close your eyes step outside
Maybe there's a better view

On the other side
We're all killing time
When it all leads to Rome
Don't pretend you know what lies
Behind those eyes

Cause you've seen her seen her seen her
Angelina oh no
You could be her be her be her
Angelina oh no

It's a lonely road
But it's all we know
It's a long way home
But it's all we know

On the other side
We're all killing time
When it all leads to Rome
Don't pretend you know what lies
Behind those eyes

Angelina Angelina Angelina
Angelina Angelina Angelina

Now you seen her Angelina oh no
You could be her Angelina oh no

Angelina in the street light
You never seem to find your way home
