I sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch

Why you complainin?
What's it to you?
You ain't even been through the things that I've been through
You don't know me,
Hell, I don't know you
Stop tryna tell me what I should and shouldn't do
You got your own lives
Stop focusing on mine
I can do what the hell I like
Baby don't waste your time

Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch

They say she was pregnant, they say she was fat
They say she was ugly, as she ain't know that
She don't suit the haircut, I think she's a try hard
I don't like the music and I think she's stupid
Damn, you people got so much to say
I wonder if you're strong enough to take my place

Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give two shits about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch

I never thought it would be that hard
Doing what I really love
All my life all I wanted to do was this nothing at all
This is my life, you can't take it
No, you bitches can't break it
None of you haters can replace it
None of you haters can take it from me

This is my life
This is my life
This is my, my, my life
