Johnny saw her ridin' on a streetcar named "desire"
His fate was sealed
She could see him comin' like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better  run, better run?
Better hide your heart
Better hold on tight
Better say your players
Cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart
Cause you're playing with fire
The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye
And said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's missing with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run?
Johnny's holding Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming
Till he had them both in sight
You could feel the chill
A shot rang out like thunder
And the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies there dying
Lovers finally understand
