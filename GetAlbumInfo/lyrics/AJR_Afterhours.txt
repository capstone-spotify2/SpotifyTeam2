Damn, now all the pretty teens and fake IDs around me.
Where did they come from?
Oh, we'll never look like all the models in the movies,
We'll never know.

But tonight, call your friends down,
We're on our way now,
And I feel like shouting, oh, I feel like shouting.
Oh, tonight, it don't matter who you're from,
Tonight we're 21 under all these lights.
(Hey)
I put my heart, I put my soul, I put my life in it,
Look at me now.
(Hey)
We're feeling dumb with coke and rum, we raise a glass to it,
The underdogs.
oohh
(Hey)
I throw my fingers to the ceiling and I won't give in,
Look at me now.

Wait, give me a minute, just a minute, get my focus straight,
They're looking bored.
When did all my friends turn into fake IDs and skinny jeans?
I don't belong.

But tonight, call your friends down,
We're on our way now,
And I feel like shouting, oh, I feel like shouting.
Oh, tonight, it don't matter who you're from,
Tonight we're 21 under all these lights.
(Hey)
I put my heart, I put my soul, I put my life in it,
Look at me now.
(Hey)
We're feeling dumb with coke and rum, we raise a glass to it,
The underdogs.
oohh
(Hey)
I throw my fingers to the ceiling and I won't give in,
Look at me now.
