So I'm thinking we should maybe just run away from here.
With no plan of coming back.
We can stay away forever, our anguished love will be all we have.
And I will save your life.
It's happening again, it's happening again.
I won't watch you die.
It's happening again, it's happening again.

I can see it's not the first time you have come and taken her from me.
Rest assured it's not the last time, I'm going to set you free.
You took her once, shame on you.
You took her twice, shame on me.

Whisper softly and tell me you love me.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Trapped inside a memory, I'm falling apart.

Do you realize it's over?
There's no chance of leaving here alive.
You don't realize what you're saying, without me you can't survive.
You took her once, shame on you.
You took her twice, shame on me.

Whisper softly and tell me you love me.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Trapped inside a memory, I've lost it all.

I'm falling apart, you've ripped out my heart.
I'm falling apart, I don't know where to start.
I don't want to go, it's happening again, it's happening again
But I can't let it show, I'll be with her again, together till the end.
If I have to go, it's happening again, it's happening again
I'll be damned if I'm alone, I'll be with her again.

Whisper softly and tell me you love me.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry.
I'm losing you, I don't know what to do.
Trapped inside a memory, I'm falling apart.
I've lost it all.
