I get lost in you
You're the sky I'm falling through
The clouds to the ground
Won't you catch me now?

Two roads converge
And neither moves forwards
We're stuck at an impasse
Can this last now?

When you stay up
I'm crashing down (down)
When you stay up
I'm crashing down

Now it feels like we're guessing and I don't know
I could stay or I could let you go
Don't wanna say that I've been wasting my time
But it feels like we're guessing
And I can't wait all my life

So hard moving on
This'll be the last one
How many times can I say
That you broke me in every way

There's nothing left to prove
He rose up and I fell through
Lost in space and I can't
I can't face what's in my way

When you stay up
I'm crashing down (I'm crashing down)
When you stay up
I'm crashing down

Now it feels like we're guessing and I don't know
I could stay or I could let you go
Don't wanna say that I've been wasting my time
But it feels like we're guessing
And I can't wait all my life

And everything that you've ever said
Is burned into back of my head
I can't forget, I can't forget
Don't be giving up on me now
Think I got you all figured out
You stay up I'm crashing down

I get lost in you
You're the sky I'm falling through
The clouds to the ground

Now it feels like we're guessing and I don't know
I could stay or I could let you go
Now it feels like we're guessing and I don't know
I could stay or I could let you go
Don't wanna say that I've been wasting my time
But it feels like we're guessing
And I can't wait all my life
