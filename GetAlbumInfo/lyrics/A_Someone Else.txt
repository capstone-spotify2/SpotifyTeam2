How many cars on the drive are actually yours...? 
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors 
You got a big big mouth 
A big big house 
Your the king of cribs right now* 
A real big hit 
No hard shit 
I swear that wont change me one bit! 

Cause i.. wish i was someone else... 
Anybody else.. 
So maybe you might talk to me. 
Cause i wish i was not myself 
Anybody else.. 
Then maybe you might notice me 

The world will still go on without you 
The newspapers still talk about you 
And if your ever low 
Pick up the phone 
I'll be round don't tell a soul 
Cause im not you 
You're bullet proof 
I'm in a crowd and i can't move 

Cause i.. wish i was someone else... 
Anybody else.. 
So maybe you might talk to me. 
Cause i wish i was not myself 
Anybody else.. 
Then maybe you might notice me 

Let me in, let me in 
Gimme the sunshine all year round 
Lemme out, lemme out 
Gimme it now 
Hear me out, hear me shout 
Gimme the munchies , show me around 
Lemme out, lemme out 
Gimme the reason 
Gimme it now 

Yeah yeah yeah... 
Yeah yeah yeah! 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Gotta big big house 
Big big mouth 
Big big house 
Big big mouth 
Big big house 
Big big mouth 
That's not helping me right now 

Cause i.. wish i was someone else... 
Anybody else.. 
So maybe you might talk to me. 
Cause i wish i was not myself 
Anybody else.. 
Then maybe you might notice me 

Cause i.. wish i was someone else... 
Anybody else.. 
So maybe you might talk to me. 
Cause i wish i was not myself 
Anybody else.. 
Then maybe you might notice me
