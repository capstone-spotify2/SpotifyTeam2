Uuhh!
Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down
'Neath the city, eatin' ground round
Underground is pretty gritty

I turned the screw she held the light
That's when I knew she was a

Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes

Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square
Never where it's pretty gritty

I turned the screw she held the knife
Oh holy Jesus

She's a sight for sore eyes
(Oh she's a nitty nitty nitty)
You a sight for sore eyes 
(Oh...she's a nitty gritty)

Turnin' in style
Walk a mile for your titty
Naked foul while under there
Underwear that's pretty gritty

Hey, don't you know people
She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh, she rust me
Dear old girl

She was a sight for sore eyes but she was sittin' pretty
Sight for sore eyes she was a nitty gritty
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes

Peeled back and parted 
Even in the car
It was delight or demise
I'm livin' like a leopard king

Sight for sore eyes 

She was a sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
