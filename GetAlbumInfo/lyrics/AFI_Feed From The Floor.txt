Dust on dust, in a new room,
First impressions of the sun
Burnt the skin now are buried.
Weâve been staring up too long.

Eyes gone dry. No more tears.
Salt and shame upon my tongue.
Dust on dust, drying flowers.
Weâve been coming here too long.

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days.

Flesh on flesh on the dry earth.
Our reflections are the same -
Wearing dust, match the desert.
Past is captured as itâs made

In your image, like an actress
Lying to protect her age.
Dust on lens. Dying flowers.
We shall not return again.

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days.

Watching as I fade,
Fading as Iâm watching every word I say,
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain...

That the rain may fall too late
It canât revive our dying flowers.
Rain may fallâ¦
Too late, this is our final hour.

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days.

Watching as I fade,
Fading as Iâm watching every word I say,
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days.
