It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside but
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide oh I
Well I don't have much money, but boy if I did you know
I'd buy a big house where we both could live.

If I were a sculptor, but then again no,
Oh a man who makes potions in a travelling show
Well I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you.

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
Oh it may be quite simple but now that it's done,
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world.

I sat on the roof child yes I did in fact I kicked off the moss
But a few a few of the verses, you know they well they've got me quite cross
Oh but the sun's been real kind while I wrote, wrote down this song,
You see it's for people like you, they keep it turned on.

So please excuse my forgetting, of these things I do
Well you see girl I've forgotten, if they're green or are they're blue
Oh well anyway, you know the thing is, honey what I really mean
Only yours are the sweetest eyes I've believe I have ever seen
Oh lord ahh you can tell everybody there that, that this is your song

Yes you can oh the whole world may be quite simple but, but now that it's gone
Yes I hope you don't mind don't mind that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
Every single line one more time girl I hope you don't mind 
Hope you don't mind that I put down in words ohh these sweet words
How wonderful life is baby while you're in my world!

Believe I sit here on the dock of the bay watching the tide rolling
Away say I'll be thinking of you love sweet memories to you.
