Black, black, black diamond
Black, black, black diamond

What's going on girl these days?
I don't know what your thinking
I know you're never gonna change your ways
So I'ma keep on drinking

What's going on with all the games you play? 
It's like you wanna fight
I know I made mistakes
But you ain't always right

Black diamond
She's shining
What a mess she's made of my life
Black diamond
She's shining
Red dress, high heels and a knife

Black, black, black diamond

Something tells me you keep on swinging
Even after the fight
You never know all the words I'm singing to all the songs I write
Another night another epic fail
And I can finally see
You care too much about your hair and nails
That you forgot about me

Black diamond
She's shining
What a mess she's made of my life
Black diamond
She's shining
Red dress, high heels and a knife

Now I feel I don't
No I don't belong with you
Now I know I feel
Like I don't belong with you

Black diamond
She's shining
What a mess she's made of my life
Black diamond
She's shining
Red dress, high heels and a knife
Black diamond
She's shining
What a mess she's made of my life
Black diamond
She's shining
Red dress, high heels and a knife

Black, black, black diamond
Black, black, black diamond
