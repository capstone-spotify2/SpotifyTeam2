Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My man has found another, and gone away
With him went my future, my life is filled with gloom,
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room

I know to you it might sound strange,
But I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Cause so badly
I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)
but I cant go no I can't let him see me cryin'
But listen, I got to cry, cuz crying, ooooooooh,
Is the pain, oh yeah

you know people, this hurt I feel inside,
Words, they, could never explain,
I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooooh baby

Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

Day in and day out, my tears stained face
Pressed against my window pane
My eye search the skies, well, desperately for rain
Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops and no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside

To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain,
I just wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooh baby

Let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Yeah, You know I'm a man, I ain't got no pride,
Til it rains, I'm gonna stay inside,
Let it rain, Let it rain
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh how I wish that it would rain...
