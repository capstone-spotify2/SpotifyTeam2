I like the sound of the ocean crashing
Waves making their way to the beach
I like the sound of the gulf breeze blowing
Holding your hand, the sand on our feet

I like the sound of raindrops dancing
As we sleep away a Sunday afternoon
And I like the sound of the alarm clock ringing
Means I'll spend another day with you

So turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that

I like the sound of a fireplace crackling
Watching a movie, holding you tight
Yeah, I love it when I hear you laughing
At that joke I've told a thousand times
And I like the sound of guitars screaming
Music so loud we talk with our eyes

Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that

I like the sound of your heart beating
In my arms, right here, right now
When it's so quiet I can hear you breathing
That may be my favourite sound

Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
