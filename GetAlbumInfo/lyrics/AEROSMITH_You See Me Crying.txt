You see me crying, don't let it getcha down.
You see me crying, I'm back to the lost and found.
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was it the words I said?
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was it the words I said?
You see me crying, say your a ladies man.
You see me crying, I'm so hard to understand.
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was the words that I said?
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was the words that I said?
You see me crying, please say you'll stick around.
And I got to be your lover, hon, let me take you to town.
And I'll show you everything that I know.
And I'll never let you go...
Cause my love is like a merry-go-around...
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was the words that I said?
Honey whatcha done to your head?
Honey was the words that I said?
Ahhh
