Oh my story is not the oldest of it's kind.
I was too touched to see you clearly, 
far too young to realize I had loved so dearly you, 
who's world I had designed, 
but the sweet smoke came with mirrors 
and it brought tears to my wide eyes.
Dying just to see you...
dying since I misconstrued your blue heart,
black eyes, feigning falling, words I won't forget.
I died right when I saw you while you shared that cigarette.

Oh I saw you every time I closed my eyes, 
in the Hughes film I had scored, 
produced and starred in, in my mind.
I could recite you, well, I'd written every line... 
but you strayed far from my flawless script 
on which I'd spent a lifetime!
Falling over dead. 
Dying since I had misread your blue heart, 
black eyes, feigning falling, words I won't forget. 
I died right when I saw you while you shared that cigarette.
