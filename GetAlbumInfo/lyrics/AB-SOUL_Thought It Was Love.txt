Uhh, whattup Brown? Whattup Blue?
Yeah, look

Thou-thought it was love, not just a mockery of
We been close since snot noses
That's some old shit, yeah no shit
You chose your path. Me? I was focused on this rapping
You was trapping and I wasn't mad
You was nickel and diming, all the while
I was getting pennies for rhyming
You was eating at Tony Roma's, I had only Top Ramen
I can smell the aroma when you pass
It ain't only the potent doja you just passed
Cause now you tryna go legit, and pick up a mic
All cause you heard So Far Gone and that shit sound tight
You see me buzzing in the streets so you figure a feature
(Should) give your name a boost like the prepaid cell phone would
I lay my verse and the verdict was:
Homie got off, but Herb murdered Cuz
And instead of studying my tactics
You turned dyslexic and now you're looking at me backwards
That's straight madness, we were compadres
And now this, what can I say?
Guess that's what happens when your stick pass the shorter end
The strongest niggas start to bend

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I thought it was love
I thought it was real
I thought you were being sincere
I thought you'd forever be here, yeah
I thought it was love
I thought it was love
I thought it was real, yeah

<i>[Brown:]</i>
She knew his track records
Took a chance on his past
Cause he was sure to
Make her laugh when she was sad
Enjoy the company, especially when her legs were spread
He was a guilty pleasure
Loved it when they were together
But nothing lasts forever
Been talking for a minute
Feelings start to develop, at first there wasn't any
She's entitled to a title but he isn't ready
For commitment, not yet
A year and a half passed in the relationship
But finding messages in his phone from miscellaneous chicks
Lies on top of lies
She was blind, didn't realize
Notice that ignorance is bliss
She put too much time and effort off into him
For it to end up like this
So she forgives what he did
But she doesn't forget
Everything that he puts her through
Through it all, she don't want it to end
Started out as a visit
He was merely a friend
Now her heart was his home
Where she felt he belonged
Was scared of being alone
Held those emotions within
She went through his phone
And she caught him again
She said

<i>[Chorus]</i>
