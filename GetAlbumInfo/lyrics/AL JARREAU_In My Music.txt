In my music, lalala
Keeps me happy
Flowin' on
In my music, lalala
You'll be the one thing
That won't ever let me down

You'll be my piece of the pie
That keeps me alive
You'll be the reason why
I give all my props to you
Oh, Ain't nothin' new
You'll be the one thing
Who I'd owe it all too, yeah

In my music <i>[2x]</i>
In my music, lalala
Inspiration is everywhere
In my music, lalala
Keeps me breathin'
Like a breath of fresh air

You'll be my morning light
That breaks through my night
You are my bloodline
What would I do without you
Hey, I always knew
You'd be the one thing
Who I'd owe it all too

In my music, lalala
I've been waiting all alone
In my music,lalala
Comes a feelin'
Like I'd never ever known

You'll be my piece of the pie
That keeps me alive
You'll be the reason why
I give all my props to you
Oh, ain't nothin' new
You'll be the one thing
Who I'd owe it all too

You'll be my morning light
That breaks through my night
You are my bloodline
What would I do without you
Hey, I always knew
You'd be the one thing
Who I'd owe it all too <i>[2x]</i>

In my music <i>[3x]</i>
