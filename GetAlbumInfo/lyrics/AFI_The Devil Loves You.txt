Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Have you ever felt? 
Ever felt this way? Tainted with rage you can't
drain away or it will cost you your life. I couldn't care more. 
Do you ever absorb what shouldn't be touched? Have you ever
cared? Ever cared this much? 
Do you think it is I who is out of touch, or are you too scared to think at all? 
I couldn't care more. 
As your friends fall does it tear your heart? 
Do tears fill your eyes as your world falls apart?
Do you notice at all,
or are you sailing sublime? Am I completely alone?
