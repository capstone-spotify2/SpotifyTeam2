Don't talk to strangers, keep away from the danger
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time, you just keep away
Just keep away

Red lights are flashing, there's been a misunderstanding
I'm Bruised and broke and bandaged
Through drinking all that brandy
I was, under the table but I came back for more
Gotta hit that bottle but my head hit the floor

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away

Red lights still flashing
People all still dancing in my head
I've done with thinking, about what to do
Another bout of drinking
Just one before I'm through
I was just raising hell I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm

I'm a
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away

Don't talk to strangers

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't talk
Danger, danger , don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger , don't talk keep away
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger

Don't you go talking to no stranger in this town
