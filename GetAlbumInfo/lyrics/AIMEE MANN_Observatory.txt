She was married to somebody else
I was lonely and lived by myself
Baby, that's a battle you can't win
So we met and we started the clock
Did that help no it did not
But I guess I knew that going in
And watched the sweeping second hand

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm

Fun is fun, but when push comes to shove
When it's done, we'll deny it was love
She will say Jim this was a mistake
And the room where we looked at the sky
Will be there with its telescope eye
Just another sentry kept awake
Watching over silverlake

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm

And you'll be glad to leave with dignity intact
She won't be sad so much as matter-of-fact
Like it was doomed and hopeless as a suicide pact

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm
Yeah, at least I managed to stay calm
