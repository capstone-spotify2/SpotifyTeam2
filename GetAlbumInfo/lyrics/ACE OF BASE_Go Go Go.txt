Hey Mr. DJ come down and play
I'm in the mood for your teasing
Give it a go with me
I need no strange hats or weird wigs
I wanna dance
Oh, give me good grooves to
Dance to
Four on the floor tonight

Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
I've been waiting
For your love
Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
On the dance floor
All the time

Go, go, go, go, go, go again
Go, go, go, go, go, go again

Take a break in the music
And charge me up
I've heard your tunes for a while now
Give me no more of that
I wanna march with the music
And have some fun
Incredibility - music (no credit)

Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
I've been waiting
For your love
Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
On the dance floor
All the time

Go, go, go, go, go, Dr. Beat
Go, go, go, go, go, Dr. Beat

Come down to me
Come down and play
Won't you come down and play with me?
Come down to me

I'm, I'm going to get to you
I'm grooving in the city
Oh, oh, give it a go with me
An inner city dreamer
I'm, I'm going to get to you
I'm grooving in the city
Oh, oh, give it a go with me

Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
I've been waiting
For your love
Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
On the dance floor
All the time

Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
I've been waiting
For your love
Go, go, go, go, go Dr. Beat
You're turning me inside out
On the dance floor
All the time

Go Go Go Go Go Dr. Beat
