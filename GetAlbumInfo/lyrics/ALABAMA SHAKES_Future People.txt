Some want to see
Those who've gone above
Friends that they lost
People they love
I'd rather meet
Freedom than roam
To lead me through the fog
Couldn't ask for more

Children
Take a living
Gotta keep up
You got to give a little, get a little
And see it
Like future people

Some things could be
Seen from above
Thread of design
Don't trip me up

Children
Take a living
Gotta keep up
You got to give a little, get a little
And see it
Like future people

Listen to teachers
Imagine a sound
Listen loud
And then they'll reach the top
