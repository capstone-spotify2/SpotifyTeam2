<i>[Adam Sandler]</i>:
Hey how ya doin'? My name's Barry Lakin and I'm here with the man on the street
quiz. This weeks's show is a doozy man, it really is. I went around the country
with my tape recorder and I taped different people having sex. I would just sit
outside their bedroom windows without anybody knowin' and I would press record
and these people would wail away on each other man they would really go at it
and I captured it on tape. Also I went around the country and I taped people in
weight rooms workin' out man. I would just sit there with my tape recorder,
press record, and these people would have themselves a workout man and I got
that on tape. Now I'm gonna play these tapes for people on the street and see
if they know the difference between people working out and people havin' sex.
Sir, what's your name?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Hi, how ya doin'? My name's Gregory Miner.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Oh terrific. My name's Barry Lakin.

<i>[Man:]</i>
Uh huh

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
And let me tell you what I did man. I went around the country and taped people
having sex

<i>[Man:]</i>
Uh huh

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
I also taped people workin' out in a weight room man. I'm gonna play one of the
two tapes for you right now

<i>[Man:]</i>
Ok

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
You dig? You tell me which of the two they're doin' okay? Workin' out or havin'
sex?

<i>[Man:]</i>

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Alright I'm pressing the play button...Now.

{Moans and screams}

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
What do you think?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Well that's people having sex.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No they were doing a Military Press

<i>[Man:]</i>
But..but they...

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No you're wrong. Thank you very much for stopping by. Amazing what people will
hear. When the human ear wants to hear sex, it hears sex. Hmm. Let's move on to
someone else. Sir, what's your name?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Uh hi my name is Ron.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Terrific. What I'm gonna do now is play a tape for you. And you tell me if
these people are havin' sex..

<i>[Man:]</i>

<i>[Man:]</i>

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>

{Moans and screams}

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
And what do you think?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Uh, that was two gay men having sex.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No those were two men doing Butterfly Curls.

<i>[Man:]</i>
Sounded like two gay guys having sex.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Well no sir, you are dead wrong.

<i>[Man:]</i>
Alright.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Thanks for stopping by. Wow, interesting. Two men, on tape, working out,
building their pectorial muscles. And this man hears gay sex. Which leads me to
the conclusion that this man is either gay himself or not straight. Moving
along. And older gentleman. How are ya sir, what's your name?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Uh Larry Bartowski

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
And Larry, how old are you?

<i>[Man:]</i>
I am 62.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
My name's Barry Lakin.

<i>[Man:]</i>
Nice to meet you Barry.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Terrific. Larry, I'm gonna play a tape for ya. Now you have to tell me if these
two people are having sex or working out. Are you ready sir?

<i>[Man:]</i>
I think I'll be able to do this.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Alright sir. Here we go. And play.

{Moans and screams}

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Okay sir. What was that? Sex or weight lifting?

<i>[Man:]</i>
That was definitely two people having sex.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No they were doing Leg Squats.

<i>[Man:]</i>
You're kidding me? They were not having sex?

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No sir, you are way off base.

<i>[Man:]</i>
I don't believe it.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Alright I'll play it back for you again sir. And if you get it right this time,
you will...be the only one who did. Okay so...play.

{Moans and screams}

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Okay, here's your second chance. What do you think?

<i>[Man:]</i>
Those people were definitely having sex.

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
No wrong again, sir. Thanks for playing the game.

<i>[Man:]</i>
You're kidding me. They, they...

<i>[Adam Sandler:]</i>
Alright sir, I'm moving on, I appreciate it.

<i>[Man:]</i>
