You thought you had me fooled.
But you have no clue what's in store for you.
Sleepless nights and dreaming of you when dreams become nightmares.
So blame me for what I'll do.

You've fallen victim to, the lie and it's just me and you.
You've fallen victim to the lie, and now it's just me and you.
And now it's just me and you.

One.
This could all be solved with a gun.
Two.
This is true now it's too bad for you.
Three.
For everything you've done for me.
Four.
You'll burn in hell, you fucking whore.

Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Just close your eyes and pretend this is a dream.
It's all a dream.
It's all a dream.

Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Just close your eyes and pretend this is a dream.
It's all a dream.
It's all a dream.

Pretend this is a dream.
