He holds my hand 
Damn, I love my man

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Love my man coz he does everything 
He can to try to please me and 
He never leaves me alone 
Always wanna call me on the phone 
Tell me how much I mean to him

How I'm never gonna ever be leaving him

Before his work his boys 
Always makin time 
Coz I'm his number one dime 
Hes my chocolate daddy 
I'm his Hershy Pie 
Apple of his eye 
Always meetin my needs 
Hes always by my side 
I love my man 
Love my man thats my man
