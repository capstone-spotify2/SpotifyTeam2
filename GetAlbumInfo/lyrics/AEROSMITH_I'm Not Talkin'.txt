I'm not talkin'
That's what I gotta say
If I say things are splendid
You might just be offended
If I say things are awful
It might just be unlawful
And that's one thing I can do without

I'm not talkin'
That's what I gotta say
I used to think I knew her
Man I sure would do her
The things that really matter
Gonna make some idle chatter
And that's one thing I can do without

Ooowwwaa... yea

I'm not talkin'
A that's what I gotta say
The things I said at midnight
I may not say in daylight
I reached a final conclusion
It only breeds confusion
So don't call me daddy I'll call you

Yeeaaaoow....

Huh... c'mon...

I'm not talkin'
That's what I gotta say
I used to think I knew her
Man I sure would do her
The things that really matter
Gonna make sweet idle chatter baby
And that's one thing I can do without

Who... whoooaa....

Yeah
