She was someone that you wanted
Someone that you'll never know now

And you know you won't resist
For going down
And now I'm falling
Into this world I don't know
Can't go home
Home to the ghost

Keep it all with you
You can take it but you're never gonna see
All the lies that were spoken
Fixin' me to leave
But did we waste it
I want somebody to believe
That we were falling
Into the world
We tore the wings where we belong
And you're never gonna know until she's gone

That's why I'm still calling
Calling in the name of love
Never stop calling
Calling in the name of love
That's why I'm still calling
Calling in the name of love
Never stop calling
Calling in the name of love

It took three whole years to fall apart
And another ten years to mend our hearts

Is there someone that you wanted
Is there someone that you cannot live without
And I know you won't be sensed
That you never even had a doubt

And now you're falling
Into a river of the treasons that you cannot recall
You still hold on
Onto the ghost

It's another past lover
Someone that you never understood
Even when it went sideways
Intentions were always good

Maybe it was true
I want somebody to believe
We were holding
Into the world we tore the wings where we belong
And your never gonna know until she's gone

That's why I'm still calling
Calling in the name of love
Never stop calling
Calling in the name of love
That's why I'm still calling
Calling in the name of love
Never stop calling
Calling in the name of love

It took three whole years to fall apart
And another ten years to mend our hearts
