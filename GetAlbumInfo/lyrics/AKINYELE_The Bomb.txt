It's the bomb, baby 
The bomb, baby 
With no ifs, no ands, no buts, and no maybes 

<i>[Verse 1]</i> 
I walk through the projects with stress in my hands 
A bad young man from the Lefrack lands 
They say I got an attitude, that's rude 
Because I walked over Elvis' grave in some blue suede shoes 
PUNK, I got some some stuff that'll bust through your pest LUMP 
Clearing cells CHUMP, you know the Ak shit BUMP 
But every now and then they say (he's wack) 
But deep down in your hear you and them dudes from Ridley's don't believe that 
Everyone's down with the Ak brother 
Every place I go people be like UDDA UDDA, UDDA 
Trying to get the slang down pat, using verbs and syllables, shit 
But I'll flip the style like half a brick 
So give me space like NASA, one deep like a bachelor 
I turn shit over like a spatula 
You know how it goes by now, word to God 
Lyrics are so hard they'll be Kevin Costner's bodyguard 
Move over Whitney Houston, I'm not losing 
By the way woman, yo, my name's not Susan 
It's the Akenyel, I rock well and with more clientel 
Then a guy with long caps of crack to sell 
I take poetry and start illin' with it 
Homicide police be looking for me from the way I be killing and shit 
You niggas can't push along, with the Ak song 
Because thise shit here's the bomb! 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 2]</i> 
I catch wreck like an automatic tec 
Ripping rhymes as if it was written with Gilletes 
Rapping over slamming tracks 
My hand's compared to a drug called crack 
Because it don't take much to get your ass smacked 
So you can save bullshit 
Word is bond get your shoehorn 
Because I got a style that fit 
See Akenyele be cold cuttin' brothers up like a DELI 
Keeping my cool like Arthur FONZARELLI 
I kick more black ass than Jim KELLY 
Down with easy shit, this nigga TELL ME 
They give me mines from state to state 
And gettin' so much props, my career should be real estate 
So now it's time to face up 
But if you play your jaw like a sneaker yo it's bound to get laced up 
For the MC's that LOST IT 
I'll treat your rock rhymes like a frisbee, watch the Ak TOSS IT 
Selling out it what ya CAUSED IT 
Charlie Angel rapper make like Farah 
And get rinsed down the FAUCET 
Becasue I'm coming at 'em 
So save your devilish tricks for eve if you don't know me from Adam 
My lyrics are hotter than summer school 
My image, far from an air conditioner beacause I never blow my cool 
No thumbs up, nor a COLLAR 
I won't scream or HOLLER 
I make MC's sit their five DOLLAR ass down 
Because all they do is scream and speak in tounges 
RAH RAH RAH, but I bust your motherfuckin' lungs 
Burning up charts with the rhymes I spark 
Cardiology is the word because it comes from the heart 
Brain is on steroids, keeping the lyrics strong 
Huh, this shit here is called the bomb! 

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 3]</i> 
I keep the mic like glass, because I slash 
Thirsty rappers' ass on a Friday night without no hockey mask 
I make Jason meet his doom 
I hit him with the bass from the room that goes 
Ba-do-doom-do-do-DOOM 
You can't fuck with it beacaue I'm a little to exquisite 
For y'all snake-ass lizards 
Check my style right before you freestyle 
My style's hostile, Teddy Ted heard it he said "Oooh child" 
I'm quick to damage you amatures some of you pros 
Know on the downlow that I'll assassinate your character 
To think that they can get with this 
With all those dreams you fuck around and put Freddy out of business 
Becasue I'm a rapper's worst nightmare 
Bringing tears for fears, I'm more bad news than the BEARS 
Say a lot for success, I won't DARE 
I'm not Shadow Stephen so I cease to be just another Hollywood SQUARE 
I rope 'em like a lasso, you'd better dash yo 
Don't stand around and be another Dennis Leary asshole 
You'll get chopped like vegetables 
I leave plenty many hanging like testicles, huh 
Doing what I half to 
To get room to breathe even if it means knocking out your asthma 
This Ak flow ain't no fad 
I be smoking niggas like cigarettes because they style is just a fucking drag 
I done blew up the World Trade and Vietnam 
Huh, beacuse this shit here is the bomb! 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
