Hangin' out and lingerin' around, cause you know where
I'll be found and I don't know how you do it.
This obsession I must admit has me shaken up a bit.
My solidarity now only comes in pairs.
I'd like to see you before you see me.
I'd like to see you leave.
Showered by torrential praise, why it is I can't explain.
Attempts to leave yeild no avail.
For me I don't know what's in store.
All I want is nothing more.
I don't deserve what I get, I have nothing to return.
