The sunlight hits the corner of your eye 
As it bounces off the morning sky 
The summer in the 70s fly by 
Bye 
Daylight hits the corners of your mind 
Steals the thought you thought no one could find 
Close your eyes and it will rob you blind
Blind 
Incidental memories collide 
Sentimental reveries abide 
Afternoon high 

Daylight hits the corners of your mouth
Steals the words that filled you up with doubt
Open up and let them all fall out 
Honey smoothes the wrinkles from you bed 
Gone are the indentations of your head 
Leaving just the frown upon your forehead
Incidental memories collide 
Sentimental reveries abide 
Afternoon high 

Worry works a wrinkle over time 
Open eyes and let it rob you blind
Incidental memories collide 
People tell me you've been blinded by
On afternoon high 
On afternoon high
On afternoon high
