<i>[Spoken:]</i> yeah, well, I don't know

In the morning (yeah yeah yeah)
When I rise (Lord have mercy!)
Sweet teardrops (and I can't understand that, y'all)
Drop from my eyes (yeah)
About the things (yeah)
That go down (and this is a peculiar thing, but look)
When a guy (Lord have mercy!)
Is not around (yeah yeah yeah)

(But looky here)
About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind (good God!)
Back and forth is a waste of time (yeah)
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime (good God, good God, good God!)

By the time (yeah)
I get where I'm goin'(and I'm gonna tell y'all one thing, look)
My whole life (my whole life, my whole life)
Is gonna be showin' (yeah yeah yeah)
All the things (yeah)
All the things that I've done (yeah, look, I can't understand that, but look)
And all because (all because, all because, all because)
I'm a foolish one (yeah yeah yeah... I can't understand that, but look)
About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind
Back and forth is a waste of time (baby baby)
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime
