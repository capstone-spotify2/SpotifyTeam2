The roof started leaking and the stairs were squeaking
There was water running down the walls
So we took down the carpet, scrubbed down the parquet
And the drains overflowed in the hall
In the pub across the street it was two feet deep
And the chairs were floating away
In the Chinese store all the food was on the floor
And they were wondering who was going to pay.

But it's alright now, she said
I'm a little bit tired, a little bit wet
But it's alright now, she said
Though I believe I have the Belsize Blues.

Conrad's bistro, the nights a go-go
With people talking over the flood
And Jenny from the newsdesk is looking at her shoes
Just to see is she's avoided the mud
And Annie comes slowly with a pile of ravioli
Fried chicken and a soup of the day
Moving âround the table, she's a little Betty Grable
In the way she's got her hair today.

But I'm alright now, she said
I'm a little bit tired, a little bit wet
But I'm alright now, she said
Though I believe I got the Belsize Blues.

Philadelphia seems like a part of my dreams
And I cannot believe that I held the sleeve of her coat
But now the night is clear as a chandelier
And the trees are turning the water into a moat.

We finally got cleared and the neighbours disappeared
We were sitting down for a rest
When the TV blew and the lights all fused
And the wine spilled all over her dress
So I lit up a candle, poured up a brandy
I was trying to get into a groove
And I was kissing her on the chin when the roof fell in
And I decided I was going to move.

But I'm alright now, she said
I'm a little bit tired, a little bit wet
But I'm alright now, she said
Though I believe I got the Belsize Blues.

That's as far as it goes now
Well, I don't suppose.
