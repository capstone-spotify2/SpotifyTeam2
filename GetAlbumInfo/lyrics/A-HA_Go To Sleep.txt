So please
Please let me come to you
And stay this time

Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
There was a time
When I could kiss
Kiss you goodnight
It will come again
In your sleep

Go to sleep
Look for a dream
Soft as your skin
The night is here now
Hide out in your dreams
Sweetest love of mine
You can sleep
Go to sleep
