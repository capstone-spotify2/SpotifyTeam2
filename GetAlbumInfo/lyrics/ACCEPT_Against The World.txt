This is the fire, started so long ago
We've kept the flame and the smoldering embers below
Deep in our hearts, our music defines our lives
We carry it on, finding a way to survive

So this is the way it must be ...... it's Us Against the World
All inhibition set free ...... Us Against the World
Into the fire we're hurled...... lt's Us Against the World

Together we stand, thinking with just one mind
Branded and pierced, fists in the air tonight
Millions of lives, brought together by common ground
A family entwined, one global nation profound

So this is the way it must be ...... it's Us Against the World
All inhibition set free ...... Us Against the World
Into the fire we're hurled ...... lt's us Us Against the World

<i>[Solo]</i>

So this is the way it must be ...... it's Us Against the World
All inhibition set free ...... Us Against the World
And so our flag is unfurled ...... It's us Us Against the World
Against the World
