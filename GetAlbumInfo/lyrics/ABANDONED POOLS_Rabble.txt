You're sitting next to me
The leaves are on the ground
My heart is in your hands
The ticking of the clock
The siren on the street
My heart is in your hands

But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me

Miles and miles of smiles
Promising the world
It's getting dark down here
We could use a little help
We could use a little spark
Its getting dark down here

But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me

You're sitting next to me
The leaves are on the ground
My heart is in your hands

But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me
But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me
