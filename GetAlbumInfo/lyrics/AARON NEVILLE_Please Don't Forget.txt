Ah ohh yaa

The holiday season puts a smile on my face
Even when I'm in a hurry going place to place
The bright lights sparkle and the snows fallin' down
I want the whole world to feel this peace that I've found

It starts with giving to all those in need
Feeding hungry children or the man on the street

Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another
Helping each other out

Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace,  peace, peace

I see a man at a store ringing a bell
Saying thank you to those who are willing to help
If we all give a little then soon it all adds up
To the real meaning of Christmas the season of love

It starts with giving to all those in need
Give a coat to a child or a gift to a family
Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another
Helping each other out

Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace, peace

Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another 
Helping each other out

Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace, peace

Peace
