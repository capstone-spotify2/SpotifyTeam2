Any way you can feel it
You shouldn't try to conceal it baby
You got to make up your mind

Any way I can steal it
Any way you can deal it to me
You know the pleasure's all mine

You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
You gotta shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Goin' round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n,
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n that's right

I wanna say you're a fire cracker
I wanna say you're a switch blade knife
You make your sex a career

Comin' down from an all night tripper
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper
'Cause you can't get there from here

You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
You gotta shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Goin' round'n, round'n, round'n,
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n,
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n,
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, 
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, 
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n

I got this feeling deep inside my gut
Overwhelming feeling of I know not what
One thing's for sure I ain't got time for those who can't relate

You gotta learn to love the midnight madness
You gotta revel in the good and badness
If ying 'n yang is your thing

What I gotta do to try and reach ya
Is it for real or just a double feature (fee cha)
So let's go throw the I Ching

You gotta love it
You wanna own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
You gotta shu uh shove it
You gotta make things happen
Goin' round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, 
round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n, round'n
