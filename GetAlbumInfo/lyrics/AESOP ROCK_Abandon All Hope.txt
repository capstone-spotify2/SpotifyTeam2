Aesop Rock (Aesop Rock)... <i>[x16]</i>

Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with
straight-jackets and robes,
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globel
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly?, feel this...

I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall!
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presents
Slug a bolt one ceremonies of merit turned blood sport (Uh)
Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumpin' out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves
DUNCED
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the wookie walk, hawkin'
Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
the point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics, see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like, bully to knuckle duster
And a scent, your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire, dance a jig around a pig
Figurin' yea, I'll lend a plan on leaked fame trackers
Using only the finest in post-modern terrain mappers
Once my brethren disperse...
My God, you'd think the heaven's touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
But I don't, confide why to choose me.
Bored, lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me

OK I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies,
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes...
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell,
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics...

Now someone's approached the roach, shaking like snow-globes
Other sort safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (yeah)
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me
See, there's a time when... rhyme and...
Pain combine can't even manage to tell what the swell is, like
Picture your imagery embellished with the hellish aspects of the swarm's forlorn facets

Soul crafted fat cats, burrowin', left perennial tenants discouraged in
Discussin' my four-season flourishing, Uh!
Surgeon purging poetic lead poison
Poised, in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride
I'm a, animated style machine in
a veening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify bottom genus species and class start to chuckle...
Buckle the architecture til it fell through.
Kill the survivors, then raise the dead for shock value
By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (yeah I'll...)
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated

So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like "Boo" Radley
Radically we consume the Colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting

I live for the moment of truth when Big Willy rapper
ackgnowledges failure and states 'Goddamn my shit is trash'
'It's time to let go', the tin man bangin' upon his chest to hear the echo:
'Heartless kid, hollow compartments'
Be we the people of the united, starving artistic
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
I'm clueing into the poison panoramics brewed in panic situations
It fucks a little with my brittle gift
I tell myself 'Stay' (Stay)... up high
make a mockery of sun, and moon, and star 
'til they hand over the sky
My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is
Invade the town while village elders holler 'Who the fuck's this?'
He hip a cats, agravated trudge through the muds
Quickin' ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood
Rugged serpentines climb, pebble the rock
Let your pretty, pink cloud nine expectations please you not
I'm, Ae-fuckin'-sop Rock, mic bizarro.
Proper application of the soul by my standard.
Candid once position from which instigations spawn
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like
Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope...
