Well I was out on a drive
On a bit of a trip
Lookin' for thrills
To get me some kicks
Now I warn you ladies
I shoot from the hip
I was born with a stiff

Stiff upper lip

Like a dog in a howl
I bite everything
And I'm big and I'm drawl
And I'll ball your thing

I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
Shoot from the hip

Yeah I shoot from the hip
Now listen

Well I'm workin' it out
And I've done everything
And I can't reform no
Can you feel my sting

Babe I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip, yeah
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
And I shoot shoot shoot
Shoot from the hip

Well I'm out on the prowl
And I'll ball your thing
I got the teeth that'll bite you
Can you feel my sting

Babe I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot shoot shoot from the hip
I got a (stiff upper lip)
Better believe me (stiff upper lip)
Comin' down (stiff upper lip)
(Stiff upper lip)
Yeah I got a (stiff upper lip)
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
And I shoot
Shoot from the hip
