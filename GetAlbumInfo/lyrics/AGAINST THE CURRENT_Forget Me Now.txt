Hey
Dear whoever, do you remember?
It's me old whatshername
Can't believe it you ain't dreamin'
I don't look quite the same

But history repeats itself
I kept making a scene
I kept raising hell
Now they call me a queen
And you're under my spell
So tell me how does it feel?
Well...

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars?
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the air waves
It's echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't forget me now

Hey whoever it's been forever
I know you know my name
I heard ya still tryna steal my throne
I guess some things never change

Always knew I'd make it out
Live a life you dream about
Now the world's in my hands
According to plan

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars?
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the air waves
It's echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't forget me now

Said you were gonna run this town
Now you get high and just drive around
It didn't happen like you thought it would, yeah
Hit me up like, âhope you're goodâ
And âcan you put me on the list tonight?â
And âby the way I got this clothing lineâ
Trying to talk like we're old friends
But, you don't even know who I am
Who I am, who I am

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the air waves
It's echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't forget me now

I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't
