Another picture on the wall
Another life I used to live
Another meaning once untrue
With every memory of you
Broken in my sleep
Another moment lost in time
You talked of love and I agreed
So many chances passed us by
And now I've lost the strength to try
Your love was never mine to keep
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed

If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you

With every night I lie awake
With every day we grow apart
Is there a promise we can't break
We never learn from our mistakes
From the very start
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed

If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you

Don't look back on yesterday 
Cuz the time has been and gone
Think of what tomorrow holds
Without you it feels so wrong
I can't carry on

If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
Oh no
If I can't have you
