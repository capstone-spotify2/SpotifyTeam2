Welcome to the end
Honest enemies and fake friends
Unbreakable bounds now bend
Pointless to make amends
So I'll just pretend

I see your true colours
I see them shining through
I see your true colours
Now you painted my world blue

Shut the fuck up
Taste the words before you spit them out
Talk shit mother fucker you don't know what I'm about
Shut the fuck up

You're like the air
Sometime you're silent but you're always there
Fire from the spark
Like a shadow you follow but gone in the dark

I see your true colours
I see them shining through
I see your true colours
Now you painted my world blue

Shut the fuck up
