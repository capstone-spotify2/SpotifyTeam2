Son of a Man, Great I am, King of heaven,
son of god, you hold the measure of my days
Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not
Before Your throne I stand amazed

Every tongue confess and every knee will bow
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now

Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless
Your name means more than i could know
You're so far above me, the way that you love me
goes further than any love could go

Wonderful Counselor, Root of David, morning star
you are the way, the truth, the life
lion of the tribe of judah, Mighty god is who you are
The only perfect sacrifice

In your name you took the blind man and you gave him back his sight
In your name you took the dead man and you brought him back to life
In your name you took this prisoner and you opened up the doors
And I will sing before your throne forever more
