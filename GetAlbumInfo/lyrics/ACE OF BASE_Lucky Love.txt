Life is a paradise
Oooh yeah!

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
I'm a prisoner of hope I know

I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you

Lucky Love....

We are young and we are old we're fallen like leaves
And your heart's so full of soul it makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you

Lucky Love...

The bridge over time was what she need to see the light
to see the light whoo yeah

Lucky Love...
