It must have taken a long long time to make a woman like you
Ooh baby, cause you're so, so fine
He took the stars from the sky, put the sparkle in your eye
Baby, don't you know, you're my only desire

When I enter the room, I smell your perfume
The taste of your lips is like the nectar from the gods
And the sunlight on your hair, is just like spun gold
After God made you, he broke the mold

God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet

To describe how your body feels when you're next to me
Like rockin' and rollin' on a stormy, stormy sea
You bring me up, oh and then you take me down,
Then you take me to heaven and back down to the ground

You're just like a rose, blooming in the spring
You're everything a man could want
Everything a man could need
And at night I fall down, on my knees
And thank God for sending an angel, just to love me

God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet

Girl, let me touch you, make sure it's not a dream
If it is please don't awake me, it would be so so mean
The thought of ever losing you is more than I could bear
It just wouldn't be heaven no more if you were not there

God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet

God made you for me (I thank God)
You're my dream come true (from high up above)
And I don't want another woman (for sending you to me)
All I need is you (for me to love)
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
Cause I love you girl, oh I love you girl
All I need is you
You're everything to me
And my lifes complete
