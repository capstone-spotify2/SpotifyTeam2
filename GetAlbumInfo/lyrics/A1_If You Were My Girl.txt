Ha Ha...If you were my girl...Ha ha ha ha
ha...If you were my girl...Ha ha ha
ha ha...

Aching to see the sun again, 
Aching to see your eyes, To see how they shine
They make this world a better place

Aching to see you smile again, 
Aching to hear you laugh and say I'm not dreamin'
When you caress my hair, your touch so warm and gentle baby
Then I can see true happiness at last...

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
If you would be my girlfriend, 
Then I would be in heaven
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my
head and sing if you were my girl
(girlfriend)

If you would be my girlfriend, 
Then I would be in heaven
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my head
and sing if you were my girl (If
you were my girl, If you were my girl)

I wish I could feel your lips right now, 
Wish I could let my hand, glide through your hair
Wish I could softly hold your hand

I wish I could tell you every dream
I wish I could tell you everything that I feel, 
I wish I could tell you that I need you here to kiss me baby
If only I could get myself to say, Hey hey...

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
If you would be my girlfriend, 
Then I would be in heaven
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my head and sing, 
If you were my girl (girlfriend)

If you would be my girlfriend, (My girlfriend)
Then I would be in heaven (Heaven)
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my head
and sing if you were my girl (If
you were my girl, If you were my girl)

There are so many beautiful girls (so many
girls) in the world (ah), but there's
only one girl that I want (so many girls)
And I've chosen today that (ah) I can't ever
stay, unless I can stay here with
you (ooh oo ohh wahohh)

<i>[Chorus:]</i> 
If you would be my girlfriend, (Girlfriend)
Then I would be in heaven (in Heaven in Heaven)
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my
head and sing if you were my girl
(Girlfriend... If you were my girl)

If you would be my girlfriend, (If you were my girl)
(I'd give you the world) Then I would be in heaven (yeah yeah)
Then I could do anything, I'd stand on my
head and sing if you were my girl
(Girlfriend...If you were my girl)

If you would be my girlfriend, (My girlfriend)
Then I would be in heaven (In heaven)
Then I could do anything, stand on my head and
sing (You know I'd do it) if you
were my girl

If you were my girl (If you was my girl)...If
you were my girl ha ha ha ha(If
you were mine) Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...Ha ha...If
you were my girl...Ha ha ha ha
ha...If you were my girl
