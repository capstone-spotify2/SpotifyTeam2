Song instead of a kiss, baby this is a song instead of a kiss
For all of you who ache, who long for nights like this

Song instead of a touch, darlin' this is a song instead of a touch
To all of you who wait so long and need so much

It is for those who like to cling, it is to those, to those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoon

It is for those who like to cling, it is to those, to those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoon
