I've been a fashion model girl
Gracing magazines
I have written songs and sonnets too
I have seen the world
Fancy cars, private planes
But I could not have done it without you

I played my part, I bared my heart
All while looking gorgeous, not to brag
But the key to my art
My one message to impart is
If you're not wearing nails
You are not doing drag
