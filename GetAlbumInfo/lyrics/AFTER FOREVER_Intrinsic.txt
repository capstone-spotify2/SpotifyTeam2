At night, assimilate life
In the infinite realm
Of our intrinsic side

Find, the missing parts of the mind
The hidden truth behind
Our dungeon of thoughts, this labyrinth

Search, it has a reason and a meaning
Remembered and repeated
A guide, not to be ignored

Feel, there's so much to feel
Amnesia must confiscate an elusive link
To consciousness

It's there; cause there's so much we don't know
Even our own true face
It's there, facing what we can't have

Our ideals ain't true, naked and exposed
To the bareness of what's real
Boundless fantasy, becomes reality
As we breathe water and run through the sand

Whispers and a scream, flying high, falling down
And a face with no features or name
Exposed to life, we can only divine
Tell me, what's your reality?
