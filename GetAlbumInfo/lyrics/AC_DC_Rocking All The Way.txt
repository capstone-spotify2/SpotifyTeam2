Well, one mad shuffle
He says two women is trouble
Sweat out a duel
I'm humming right at you
I said you didn't even rate
Comin' on at night
You know to come along with you
You gotta run away and hide
Two by two
Well, I said I'm comin' right at you

She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin out to play

She's sexy in her boots
Tear up all the news
Shoot you in the back
Driving you mad
Come on hear me out
And take my advice
She won't stop until you're in her sights

She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out today
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out to play
She's goin' all the way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah all the way

She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out to play

One man shuffle
Two women trouble
Gonna kick ya right off the track
Ya gotta push it, lug it
Thrust her over it
She's gonna make it, pay, all the way
She's comin' out my way
She rockin' all the way
