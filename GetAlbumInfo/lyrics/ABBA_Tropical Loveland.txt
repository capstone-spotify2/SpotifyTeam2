Come to my loveland, wander along
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land

The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny
Happy and sunny
Oooh, in my tropical loveland

Come to my loveland, wander with me
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree
Over the rainbow, under the moon
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?

Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny
Happy and sunny
Oooh, in my tropical loveland

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
(I wanna share it with you)
Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
(It's a tropical loveland)
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
