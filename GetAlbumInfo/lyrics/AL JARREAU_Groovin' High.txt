Be silent
And listen
The summer night has got something to say
Honey be silent
And listen

A little whisper like a preacher would pray
Honey be silent
And listen
Slow down a moment we been talkin' all day
What wonderful story it's tellin'
We'll hear it if we stop yellin'
So Honey be silent
And listen

The night'll whisper little things in your ear
Be silent,
And listen,
It's gonna whisper something you wanna hear
Honey be silent
And listen

And when you've heard it and it's ever so clear
Define every meanin'
cuz I will be dreamin' away
Hey don't scream
That way

Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so so no one hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it's true dear
there's no one but you
Won't you keep...

Whisper why you'll never leave me
Whisper why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you.
Be silent
And listen

The summer nights has got something to say
Honey be silent
And listen
A little whisper like a preacher would pray
Honey be silent
And listen

Slow down a moment we been talkin' all day
What wonderful story it's tellin'
We'll hear it if we stop a'yellin'
So Honey be silent
And listen

The night'll whisper little things in your ear
And listen,
Be silent,
And listen,
It's gonna whisper something you wanna hear
Honey be silent
And listen

And when you've heard it and it's ever so clear
Define every meanin'
cuz I will be dreamin' away
Hey don't scream
That way

Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so so no one can hear me

Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it's true dear
there's no one but you
Won't you keep...

Whisper why you'll never leave me
Whisper why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you.
