I was so much an outcast
No one ever liked me cause I wasn't wanted
I was so different from the rest of them all
Fucked up on the drugs, from all the speed
And I never got no sleep
Cause I kept on trippin' over what they said
And everything that my mom said made me mad
And everything that my dad said made me sad

Why am I even trying?
I'm crying out, I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out

You keep shootin' those glances
Relating to the rawness, of a fuckin lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me, talk like me, walk like me
You keep trippin' on everything I wear, every time I swear
Even when it comes to my hair
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind
I'm not a dumb fool in your life

Why am I even trying?
I'm crying out, I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out, I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Coming down, breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out

Now do you trip?
Are you still tripping on me?
Now do you trip?
Are you still tripping on me?
Now do you trip?
Are you still tripping on me?
Now do you trip?
Why are you tripping on me?

I was so much an outcast
Find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
No ever liked me
I can't find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right

Why am I even trying?
I'm crying out, I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out, I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Coming down, breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm crying out, I'm crying out, I'm crying out, freaking out
Coming down, breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
