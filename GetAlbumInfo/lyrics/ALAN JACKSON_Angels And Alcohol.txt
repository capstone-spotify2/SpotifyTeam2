You can't mix angels and alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control, you can't love no one at all
You can't mix angels and alcohol

You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
They don't go together, love's already hard enough
You think you can handle, how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love

You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short easy time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine

You can't mix angels and alcohol
An angel once loved me, I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix angels, and alcohol
