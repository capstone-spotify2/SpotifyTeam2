In the virgo cluster
In the Milky-way
Third rock from a star
Where my people stay
They called us human
We call ourselves by our color
To eyes from above
It seems we murder each other
So futuristic
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
So futuristic, I hope that we could fix this

Adam and Eve
Sitting in the Garden of Eden
God said do what you wish
'Cept for that apple don't eat it
You got all of this here
I swear to me, you don't eat it
If you do I'll write a book
And make your descendants read it
But I created you, wired you
To know you'd always want more
Because after all
That's what the concept of Heaven's for
Y'all don't wanna die, gotta have that alternate endin'
It's something to look to
When you know you ain't been livin'
When you hate what you're given
But never worked to have more
It's easier to trick yourself
Into thinkin' there's more
But Earth could be Heaven
And you could be God
It's true that you could be
The artist, paint the life that you want
Earth's a beautiful canvas
A miracle to behold
As long as you don't get caught up
In all the green and the gold
You wait for miracles
Straight out of the book of ladders and psalms
Maybe the fact, we're even here's
The biggest miracle of all
Perfectly distanced from the Sun
To have light but not burn up
A moon to guide the tide
And to give us light to the sun
Planets on the outter rim to block the cosmic debris
A speck of dust and a sunbeam
Is really all that we be
Think about that
When we talked about the concept of peace
Our fighting in ignorance
Keeps us far from the key
Over who's God's better
Who's really reppin' the truth
Burnin' down houses for who lives over the roof

In the virgo cluster
In the Milky-way
Third rock from a star
Where my people stay
They called us human
We call ourselves by our color
To eyes from above
It seems we murder each other
So futuristic
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
Why's peace, love and happiness so futuristic?
So futuristic, I hope that we could fix this

In the USA, home of the free and the brave
That's what we were promised but I don't see that today
Screaming "I can't breathe"
Cause we all drowning in lies
The Garner tragedy
Saw that with our own eyes
Screaming "film the police"
And still the system is fucked
The people are over it, everyone has had enough
And I've had enough of artists not speaking up
This a serious problem it ain't an issue to duck
Fuck what color I am, speak on it because I'm human
Throw police the power and then we watch them abuse it
We saw their shady ways said the C.I.A
Grand Jury, prosecutors treating cop cases the same
When some dies by another, take it to trial no questions asked
Cause it seems when you work with each other you'll get a pass
My heart goes out to every family whose every been affected
Middle fingers goes to every cop who ever benefited

I know racism is alive
I see the fire in people's eyes
I hear the screams of a mother's cry
Let the power stand down
Let the people rise
I know racism is alive
Carried by those
Holding onto different sides
Whether you're red, yellow, blue, brown, black or white
Let us look upon the world we'll equalize
Only then can we equalize
When we start to look to equalize
Only then can we equalize
Until then we're all living equalize
