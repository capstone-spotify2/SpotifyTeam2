Oh freedom,
Oh freedom,
Oh freedom over me
And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave
And go home to my lord and be free

No more weeping,
No more weeping,
No more weeping over me.
And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave
And go home to my lord and be free

No more worry,
No more worry,
No more worry over me
And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave
And go home to my lord and be free

Oh freedom,
Oh freedom,
Oh freedom over me
And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave
And go home to my lord and be free
