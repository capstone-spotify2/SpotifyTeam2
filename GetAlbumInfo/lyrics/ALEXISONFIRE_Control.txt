This burden's not a heavy one
But I assure you, it's present
This burden's not a heavy one
But I assure you, it is present

Say that you're in control
Say that you are
I can't think of a time
When you looked less alive
You say, "Wait until light, my dear, 
just wait until light"
One more day will go by
Maybe today you should try
To look past the mirror and find
Look past the mirror
That there's something inside
Something more to your life
My words won't heal you now
My words won't heal
It is you who decides
It is you who decides

This burden's not a heavy one
But I assure you, it's present
This burden's not a heavy one
I assure you

Believe that you are just fine
Believe that you are
You'll feel so alive
You'll feel so alive
Be what you are now (be what you are)
Be what you are
Do not keep it inside
The hate will not subside
Be what you are now (be what you are)
Be what you are
Do not keep it inside
The hate will not subside

It's you, decide
It's you, decide

So alive
You'll feel so alive

This burden's not a heavy one
But I assure, I assure you 
This burden's not a heavy one
Not a heavy one
Not a heavy one.
