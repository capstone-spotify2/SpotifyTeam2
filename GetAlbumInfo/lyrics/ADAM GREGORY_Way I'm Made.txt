I dreamt last night I was far away
Where coyotes howl and cotton woods sway
Casting shadows in firelight
A cowboy moon burns so bright

I'd like to think John Wayne's out there
On his horse the wind in his hair
Somewhere riding out there

And I'd like to believe there's someone for me
That God made especially
And custom made for me

That's just the way I'm made
I'm put together
Bailing wire and string
What not whatever comes my way

That's the way I'm made

And I like to work hard in the sun
And do my job 'til the day is done
Work just as hard at havin' fun

And I'd like to turn, turn the music up
Windows down kick up some dust
That's just what I love
Just be yourself, be who you are
Say what you mean, speak from the heart
Mean what you say, finish what you start

Just be yourself, be who you are
Just be who you are

And I'd like to think John Wayne's out there
On his horse the wind in his hair
Somewhere riding out there

And I'd like to believe there's someone for me
That God made especially
Custom made for me

That's the way I'm made...
