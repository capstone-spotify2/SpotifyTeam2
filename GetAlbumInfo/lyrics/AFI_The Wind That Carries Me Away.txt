Wrap the sky in your arms.
Hold it to you heart.
Turn the dust to diamonds
And here we finally part.

And here we finally part.
And here we finally part.

And the wind that brought me down
Cannot stay.
And the wind that carried me out
Carries me away, carries me away.

Crush the dust in your hand.
Hold it to your heart.
Promises mean nothing
Until we finally part.

And here we finally part.

And the wind that brought me down
Cannot stay.
And the wind that carried me out
Carries me away, carries me

And the blood (blood) runs (runs)
Further into blind eyes.
And the blood (blood) runs (runs)
Faster than we can.

And the wind that brought me down
Cannot stay.
And the wind that carried me out
Carries me away, carries me away.

Carries me away.
