We Walked Away Before, Now After Many Storms
We Could Not Get Through
But I Still Kept Loving You

Now Fate Brought You Back To Me
This Time I Won't Let You Leave
I'm Holding Onto You, Forever
I'm Never Letting Go

The Time I Spent Away From You
Is Time That Made Me See
I Need To Live This Life With You
I Need You Here With Me

It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
To Take Me From Your Arms Again
To Take Me From Your Side

It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
To Pull Away This Heart Of Mine
To Make Us Break Apart This Time
It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind

Hearts Sometimes Loose Their Way
But They Find Their Way Back Someday
To The Arms They Need
And I Need You, Like The Air I Breathe

The Time I Spent Away From You
Is Time Lost In The Rain
I Meant To Live This Life With You
That's Something Nothing Can Change

It Would Take a Strong Strong Wind
To Take Me From Your Arms Again
To Take Me From Your Side
It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
To Tear Away This Heart Of Mine
To Make Us Break Apart This Time

It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind

This Time I'm Holding On With Everything
This Time I Won't Let Go for Anything

It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
To Take Me From Your Arms Again
To Take Me From Your Side
It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
To Put Away This Heart Of Mine
To Make Us Break Apart This Time

It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
It Would Take A Strong Strong Wind
