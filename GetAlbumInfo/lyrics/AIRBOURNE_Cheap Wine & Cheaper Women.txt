Walking through the city
It's lonely heartbreak streets
The wind gives a chill as the sun begins to weep
Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't know where I've been
But the nights coming down and I'm feeling good again

Cheap Wine
And cheaper women
Give me cheap wine
And cheaper women

Had myself a lady
To hold me tight and warm
To keep out the cold and make love til' the dawn
Yeah she loved me tender
And she loved me sweet
But then she kicked me out and now I'm on the street

Cheap Wine
And cheaper women
Give me cheap wine
And cheaper women

Women come and go
They never do remain
They take more than they give
But it's me who's to blame
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
And nothin's all I got
Yeah it may not be the answer but it sure does hit the spot

Cheap Wine
And cheaper women
Give me cheap wine
And cheaper women

Cheap Wine
And cheaper women
Give me cheap wine
And cheaper women
