Someone said they saw me fall apart
Part of me collected and destroyed
Tell me what it's like to hold a heart
When it shatters

Someone said that they ran into her
Asked if there was any word of me
And she swore that everything we were
Never mattered
(There is a face beneath the waves)

I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you
I am

Are you somewhere listening to me?
Have these whispers finally found the cracks?
White walls won't forever keep these screams
They will shatter

Secretly, you know that I'm still here
While you're being held you're so alone
For you killed the only one who cared
Let it shatter.
(There is a voice within the walls)

I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you
I am

What do you do
When my soul invites you?
Oh, you'll see me again
You know this will never end
What do you do
When your heart reminds you?
Oh, you'll put me to death
But I will return again

I will return again
I will return to you
I will return again
I am part of you
I will be with you again, with you again
I am
