Twas the night before christmas all white with snow
I was lying back waiting for my baby to show
I was searching my mind for the right things to say
'cause she had to leave the very next day
When out on the driveway I heard such a clatter
I dimmed all the lights and put on clyde mcphatter
And she came to the doorway and she gave me a kiss
And the rest of the night went something like this.....

It was a night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
The moon was bright
Oo how bright it was, it really was
Such a night
The night was alive
With the stars above
Oo when she kissed
I had to fall in love.

Oo it was a kiss
Oo what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
How she could kiss!
Oo what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire
I reminisce, I'm filled with desire.

And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender (doo wah, doo wah)
Oh how I remember! (doo wah, doo wah)
I'll always remember...(doo wah, doo wah)

Oo that night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn

And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oo such a kiss
Oo such a night

And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender (doo wah, doo wah)
Oh how I remember! (doo wah, doo wah)
I'll always remember (doo wah, doo wah)

Oo that night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oo such a kiss
Oo such a night

Well it's now christmas morning and my baby's gone
So I light up the tree and turn the radio on
I sit down in my chair and let out a sigh
I sang away in a manager and angels on high
Now my family and friends will soon knock on my door
So I'll say merry christmas to you and to yours
May your days be cheerful and your burdens be light
Oh but mostly I wish everyone such a night

Now she's gone, gone, gone
Yeah she's gone, gone, gone
And the dawn, dawn, dawn
And the night was gone
And my heart was gone
And her love was gone
And before the dawn
Oh oh oh
Such a night!!
