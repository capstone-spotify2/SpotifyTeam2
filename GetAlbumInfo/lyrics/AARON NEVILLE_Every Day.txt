Every day along about noon
Oh how I'm dreaming of the day that I'll be home soon

And every day along about one
Oh how I remember how we used to have fun

And every day along about two
Whoa how I'm so lonely in a world so blue

And every day now along about three
When I'm dreaming of a day that I'll be free

And every day along about four
But I cry, whoa I cry, till I can cry no more

And every day along about five
I'm writing you a letter with a tear in my eye

And every day whoa just about six
Whoa how I remember how we used to kiss

And every, every, every day now oh how it reminds me of you
Whoa I wanna tell you, please listen to me
'cause I love you, love you, I love you
