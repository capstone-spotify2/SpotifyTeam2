You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang
You're gonna hang

What's the best that you can hope for?
Pity fucks and table scraps?
Subterfuge and detachment?
A bullet in the head and a bullet in the chest

You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang
You're gonna hang

What's the best that you can hope for?
A blind-fold and a ball-gag?
Burnt out eyes, grotesque beauty
A nail through the feet and a nail though the hands

You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang
You're gonna hang
