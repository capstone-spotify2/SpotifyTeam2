Heaven is singing of all Your wonders
Angels declaring, of all the goodness of God
And they will never cease to praise

Creation trembles at just a mention
The King eternal makes darkness vanish and hide
And we will ever sing His praise

Triumphant conqueror, forever glorious
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
Our mighty warrior, the banner over us
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
You are worthy

The stars and galaxies lift up a melody, 
Infinite anthems ring echo the glories of God
And they will never cease to praise

Triumphant conqueror, forever glorious
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
Our mighty warrior, the banner over us
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
You are worthy

Weâre singing Holy, Holy
Oh Holy, Lord almighty
For there is no one like You
Worthy, worthy

Here on the earth beneath, we join eternity
With grateful hearts redeemed
We crown You King and Lord of all
And we will ever sing Your praise

Triumphant conqueror, forever glorious
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
Our mighty warrior, the banner over us
Our Lord victorious, You are worthy
You are worthy
