Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour?
Me too 
Like we're being guided by some higher power 
Me too 
Do you kinda get the feeling this feeling's so right
There must be a reason we're together tonight 
Do you think it might be love we're falling into?
You do? 
Me too 
Don't you wanna know where this emotion is going?
Me too 
Wouldn't you hate to go thru life never knowing? 
Me too
Is it my imagination or is something so strong 
Going on between us that it can't be wrong 
Do you think you've got the heart to see this thru? 
You do?
Me too 
Do you think you've got the heart to see this thru 
I really wanna know baby, tell me the truth 
| Do you think it might be love we're falling into? 
You do? You do? You do... 
Me too
Me too
Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour? 
Me too
Like we're being guided by some higher power?
Me too
Say you do, say you do, say you do 
Say you do, say you do, say you do 
Can you feel it? 
BABY, can you feel it? 
Can you feel it baby?
Me too
