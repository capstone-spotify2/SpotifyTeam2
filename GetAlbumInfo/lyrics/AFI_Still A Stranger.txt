There is a mis-, misunderstanding that thereâs a bliss beneath it all
That every time itâs never ending, there is a kiss to change us all.
Itâs in the dark, itâs in your photo that keeps falling from the wall.
Tell me itâs better way up there. I need you. I need you. I need you to tell meâ¦

Does it feel the same
After healing fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt.
I feel so strange. Iâm still a stranger.

Is there the mis-, misunderstanding that thereâs a hit of healing light?
Tell me the cuts finally stop showing before we kiss, again, the night.
Here in the dark, tripping your picture I keep rehanging on the wall,
I need you better way up there. I need you. I need you better.

Does it feel the same
After healing fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt.
I feel so strange. Iâm still a stranger.

Does it feel the same?
Would I feel like you?
Because I still feel strange.
Are you a stranger too? (Iâm still a stranger)
I wish it mattered more (Iâm still a stranger)
But I never will be you.
I always  feel so fucking strange.
Are you a stranger too?

Iâm still a stranger.
Iâm still a stranger. (Are you a stranger?)

Does it feel the same
After healing fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt.
I feel so strange. Iâm still a stranger.

Iâm still a stranger.
Iâm still a stranger.
