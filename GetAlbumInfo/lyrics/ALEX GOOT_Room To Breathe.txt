Thanks for giving me a chance to be
The one and only thing
That makes me believe

So donât waste your time on me
I wonât give you room to breathe

Desperate boy sees desperate girl
The only thing is desperate boy took a wrong turn
So donât waste your time on me
I wonât give you room to breathe

You keep saying you want to run
And you say, you say, you say
I can save you tonight, whoa
I will worry about tomorrow

Donât waste your time on me
I wonât give you room to breathe
