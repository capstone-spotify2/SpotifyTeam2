I do alright, most of the time
I've learned to move on, I've learned to get by
But sometimes I can't find the reason to be free
So I leave a light on for your memory

I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
When it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memory

You found a new love and I'd like to believe
That you're really better off without me
The good days have slipped away but I sometimes dream
So I leave a light on for your memory

I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
When it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memory
Yeah, when it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memory
