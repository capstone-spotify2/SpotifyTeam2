Hot summer's gone and you're still ready to burn
Back from vacation and you're eager to learn
Anticipation mixed with desire
No one can stop you cause you're heart's on fire

Back, back to school
I'll teach you all the things that you never knew
You're going back, back to school
I'll give you everything and you know it's true
cause it's back to school for you

Now I'm the teacher, but I have no degree
Forget the rest I'll teach you biology
Now just relax and you'll do your best
Concentrate and you'll past the test

I'll be your teacher and you'll be my pet
Put down your notebook
cause there's no written test
Graduation is what you deserve
You'll have no problem
cause I grade on a curve

You're goin' back, back to school
You're goin' back, back to school
You're goin' back, back to school

You're goin' back!
You're goin' back, back to school
