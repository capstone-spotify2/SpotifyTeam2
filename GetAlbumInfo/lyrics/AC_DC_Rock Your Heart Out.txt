Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on dance with thee
You gotta
Throw your fists up
Shout your mouth off
Beat the walls down
Get tough, freak out
Rock your little rock your little
Rock your little heart out

Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost
Just sell your soul to me
You gotta
Bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on let's fly
Rock your little rock your little
Rock your little heart out
Rock rock your little heart out
Rockin' on down

You gotta
Put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out
Rock rock your little heart out
Rock rock your little heart out
Rockin' on down
Rock your little rock your little heart out
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out

Rock your heart out, rock your heart out
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out

You gotta rock your little rock your little rock your little
Heart out
You gotta rock your little heart right
Right out
