I want to know the places that you go when you're all alone.
And I want to see all the secrets that you keep when you're not with me.
And I'll open the treasures of love deep in my heart.

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
And I promise I'll hold you close to me.
I'll write you a song with words so sweet
And I'll sing to you the melody,
'Til you Love me.

Tell me your dreams
And every wish that I might grant for thee.
Open your heart and let me fill you up with everything you need.
And we'll walk step by step, you and me in harmony.

<i>[CHORUS X1]</i>

Show me the key
And I'll write a symphony for you and me.
Words can't explain how much your love means to me.

<i>[CHORUS X3]</i>
