The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeah boogie

I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean

But I've got a Mumma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place that woman

Just you wait
One of these days see me driving round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice

No it ain't no fun, yeah
Waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Do you believe me
It ain't no fun, no
Waiting round to be a millionaire
It ain't no fun, I don't care what they say
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain't no fun, and you know it
Waiting round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no , no, no, no
No, ain't no fun
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Got a million dollar scream
But it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun), oh no
No it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun), that's what I said
But it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun), and I wanna be rich
No it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun), ain't no fun digging this bitch
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, you better believe me
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
I ain't having no fun (ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, no no
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire

"Hey Hello Howard, how ya doin'?
"Next door neighbour?"
"Oh yeah... Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport"

(Ain't no fun, ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun)
Hey it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun, (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun, no it ain't no fun, ain't no fun
(Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire)
(Ain't no fun...)
