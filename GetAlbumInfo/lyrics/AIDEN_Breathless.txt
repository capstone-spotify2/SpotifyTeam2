We passed though like a nightmare falling down, without touching the ground. 
This ghost and vacant eyes deceive thee, they've come to take me without words and silence. 
With a hand now crushing hope this late kiss, you've come to make this my last night home. 

I promised everything. The necklace and those things you made will go with me everywhere I go. 
Well, it's not the end. I won't pretend it's impossible to fix what can't be broke. 
I'm breathless and disconnected.

Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today. 
I will return for you.

Now I've seen the world through eyes of bitter hate and lies and now I can't stand what I have become. 
Was there something I missed? Can you replay this kiss? And the ghost sought by my side, 
I'm breathless and disconnected.

Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today. 
I will return for you.

Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today. 
I will return for you.

I won't forget those times we spent, 
cutting our silhouette, waking up nights again. 
I am afraid because I'm open and undone. 

I won't (I won't) forget (forget) those things you said, 
a stab to the heart and head, killing without and end. 
I am afraid because I'm open and undone.

Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today. 
I will return for you.

Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today. 
I will return for you.

We passed though like a nightmare falling down, without touching the ground.
