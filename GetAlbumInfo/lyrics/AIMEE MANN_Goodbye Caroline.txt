Put on your shoes, girl
I'm goin' to the coast
Where every loser
Gives up what hurts the most
And all those haunted
Unlucky guys get told
Who's really wanted
And who just can't stay sold

Goodbye, Caroline
You're my favorite faith healer
Goodbye, everything
Say I gave to the house dealer
Who could only really let you down

Put on your coat, babe
My luck is winding down
I'll get your suitcase
And pull the car around

Goodbye, Caroline
You're my favorite faith healer
Goodbye, everything
Say I gave to the house dealer
Who could only really let you down

Where it's lit day for night
And the clocks wear their faces bowed
Where the hands and cuffs gleam white
As they hang on a nicotine cloud

Goodbye, Caroline
Goodbye, everything

Goodbye, Caroline
You're my favorite faith healer
Goodbye, everything
Say I gave to the house dealer
Who could only really let you down
Who could only really let you down
Who could only
Let you down
Let you down
Let you down
Let you down
