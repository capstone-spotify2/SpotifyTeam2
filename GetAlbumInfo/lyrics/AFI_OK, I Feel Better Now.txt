There is nothing to me
There is nothing, though there was a time
I had felt elation
Before all sensation died
I cannot breathe
I can't deny
That I've been feigning, for you, every vital sign
Defied

This means nothing to me
This means nothing, so spare me the lies
I deny you sympathy
Just as I have been denied
I cannot breathe
I can't deny
That I've been faking, for you, every sign of life
I died

For the last lie
And the heartbreak
For the first time
I could not take
I could not take
'Til I made you cry

This is what you taught me
This is what you taught, and I learned well
To recognize that feeling
Easily can be dispelled
I cannot breathe
I can't deny
That I've been faking, for you, every sign of life
I died

For the last lie
And the heartbreak
For the first time
I could not take
I could not take
'Til I made you cry

Show your wounds I'm bored with mine
Nothing is new
Don't despair, I rarely cry
Oh my

Oh my, dear, please dry your eyes
Who could harm you?
To hurt you is to be despised
As I'd love to

For the last lie
And the heartbreak
For the first time
I could not take
I could not take
'Til I made you cry

'Til I made you cry <i>[x3]</i>
