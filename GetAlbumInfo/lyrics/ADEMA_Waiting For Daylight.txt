We'll raise our fists and stamp our feet
We will resist all out thoughts, until we succeed
We're marching at the scene
We'll watch them crumble
Oh, we're gonna watch them die

When all the people settle down
All the alcohol runs out
I'll just sit here by myself
Waiting for
Each and every soul's moved in
All walls are closing in
Waiting for
Wishing I was someone else
Waiting for
Waiting for the daylight to come

The highway's coming on by tonight
We'll kill the headlights
Roll right through the twists and the turns
We'll make our move when the time is right
We'll start the fire
Oh, we'll watch it burn

When all the people settle down
All the alcohol runs out
I'll just sit here by myself
Waiting for
Each and every soul's moved in
All the walls are closing in
Waiting for
Wishing I was someone else
Waiting for
Waiting for the daylight to come

I take everything I'm given
Can't stand because the room keeps spinning
This is the life I am given
I take everything I'm given
Can't stand because the room keeps spinning
This is the life I am given

When all the people settle down
All the alcohol runs out
I'll just sit here by myself
Waiting for
Each and every soul's moved in
All the walls are closing in
Waiting for
Wishing I was someone else
Waiting for
Waiting for the daylight to come
