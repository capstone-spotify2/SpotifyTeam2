<i>[Wade:]</i> I, I guess the only thing cheap to you was your friends
<i>[George:]</i> You can always make new friends
<i>[Wade:]</i> (oh well, oh well)
<i>[George:]</i> But when you sell them out will they be worth as much? 
<i>[2x]</i>

<i>[George:]</i> Now this bridge is ashes
It might as well have never been built
It might as well have never been built
and the river that it crossed
Looks like an ocean now
looks like an ocean now

<i>[Wade:]</i> Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
<i>[Dallas:]</i> Love to play the victim
<i>[Wade:]</i> You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
<i>[Dallas:]</i> Was it all for nothing?
<i>[Chris:]</i> Keep it on wax

<i>[George:]</i> You're not the only one
Who's had to make sacrifices
We all had to make sacrifices
And time won't heal shit
When you've got your hands in my pockets
When you've got your hands

<i>[George:]</i> Kick, Kick, Kick
Scream, Scream, Scream
<i>[Wade:]</i> It don't change a goddamn thing (It don't change)
<i>[George:]</i> Kick, Kick, Kick
Scream, Scream, Scream (A goddamn thing)
<i>[2x]</i>

<i>[Wade:]</i> I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends

<i>[George:]</i> Oh, what a fucking shame
Oh, that you had to mess things up this bad

<i>[Wade:]</i> Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
<i>[Dallas:]</i> Love to play the victim
<i>[Wade:]</i> You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
<i>[Dallas:]</i> Was it all for nothing?

<i>[Wade:]</i> It's gone, it's gone
<i>[George:]</i> There's nothing left
<i>[Chris:]</i> Keep it on wax
<i>[2x]</i>
