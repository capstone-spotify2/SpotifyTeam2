The things you taught me just a little while
Would've taken me a hundred years
I can't imagine travelin' these miles
Without somebody like you here

I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
'Cause he loves them too much to let them stay
I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
But I didn't know it was gonna be today

I remember the places that we've been
The little things we used to do
Looking back now that's when I began
To realize that I'm a lot like you

I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
'Cause he loves them too much to let them stay
I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
But I didn't know it was gonna be today

Friends and family help to pass the time
I'm thumbing through pictures of you
Feelin' lonesome, missin' you and cryin'
That's not what you'd want me to do

I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
'Cause he loves them too much to let them stay
I guess I knew all along, he'd take his angels home
But I didn't know it was gonna be today
No, I didn't know it was gonna be today
