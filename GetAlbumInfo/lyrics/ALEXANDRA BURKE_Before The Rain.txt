Once upon a time there was a story
So unreal, it's hard to tell
No-one seems to understand
Once within my mind, there was a name
That I can't even start to spell
Cause I don't want to break again

All I do and all I am
Everything's because of him

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
My hell, my heart, my honesty
Myself and I, with all of me
I would give him all that I had
But all I had was not enough and
My voice, my eyes will never see
The way they looked and spoke of me
Nowhere I can go to regain
Whatever I was before the rain

Every single time I close my eyes
My mind goes back to where he was
Cause she don't want to understand, no no
Love is not a crime, but it sure feels like doing time
My mind is shut, and she don't wanna let me in no

And all I do and all I am
Everything's because of him

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Whatever I was before the rain
Once upon a time there was a story
So unreal, it's hard to tell
No-one seems to understand, oh

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Oh, oh, oh
Whatever I was before the rain
Whatever I was before the rain
