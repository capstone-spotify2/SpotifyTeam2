Air on the streets, lights on the trees
Eight days a week, singer's disease
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
Having my moment, you know what I mean 

Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 

Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.
I wanna stay here and never go home again
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
I wanna be the shops on your high street
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud 

Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 

Get a voice, don't get a doctor
That's your choice, no-one can stop you
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Got a job, I don't got no pension
In it for love - money's too tight to mention
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
I wanna do what I want if it kills me
Have to say, your home's where you make it
It's OK, I know when you fake it
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one you can be around
