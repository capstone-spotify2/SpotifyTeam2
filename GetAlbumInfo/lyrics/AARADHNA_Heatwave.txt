Whenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearing me apart

Whenever he calls my name
Sounds so soft, sweet and plain
Right there, right then
I feel this burnin' pain
Has hot blood pressure gotta hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearing me apart

Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it
Don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now that funny feeling got me amazed
Don't know what to do
My head's in a haze

It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearing me apart

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah
Oh oooooh Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Oh ooooooh Yeah

Now that funny feeling got me amazed
Don't know what to do
My head's in a haze

It's like a heat wave
Ooh it's like a heat wave
Said it's like a heat wave
Oh it's like a (heat wave)
