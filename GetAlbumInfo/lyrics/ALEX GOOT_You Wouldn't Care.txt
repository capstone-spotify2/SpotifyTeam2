Well Iâm cracking up, looking at things.
The pieces I have to remember
And it canât be gone, gone for good
You have to understand, at least you should
Well at least you should
Whoa, Iâm glad you understand

I donât want to go without you, I wonât go at all
Cause I canât even live with you,
Any hope I have is false
I donât want to go without you, I wonât go at all
Cause I canât even live with you,
Any hope I have is false

There will be no one to stop you this time
I fell in your trap and you got what you wanted
Youâre getting in the way of someone else
And Iâm leaving you just for them

I donât want to go without you, I wonât go at all
Cause I canât even live with you,
Any hope I have is false
I donât want to go without you, I wonât go at all
Cause I canât even live with you,
Any hope I have is false

And if itâs meant to be, it wonât necessarily be
This is way too much to handle for me
Open your eyes and maybe you will see
This shouldnât be over yet

Itâs a trap, itâs a trap, now thereâs no turning back
Did I fall in?
Well itâs easy to tell
I fell in, I fell in
And in your mind you win
I can tell, I can tell, cause Iâm going through hell
And we donât even talk, but at least we donât fight
Did you feel grief? No. You never felt anything.

Never forget everything that we had, Iâm holding on
I donât want to go without you, I wonât go at all
Cause I canât even live with you,
Any hope I have is false
