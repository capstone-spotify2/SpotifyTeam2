You're looking good, you get me so hot
Know you can satisfy my needs
Like taking candy from a baby
Make me forget about reality

Foxy &amp; free
You take my breath away (breath away)
So foxy

You've got the power and the passion
You make me lose my sense of pride
Watchin' you and you're on fire
I know what you're thinking, I can read your mind

Foxy &amp; free
You take my breath away (breath away)
So sexy, but to me
You take my breath away (breath away)
Now foxy, listen to this

Foxy (foxy)
I know you drive me wild
Lookin' at you Voodoo Child
Alright, baby
Now here it comes

Fire and ice, black leather, satin
You've got the moves I've always craved
You've got a look that drives me crazy
You're hot enough to raise the dead from the grave

Foxy &amp; free
You take my breath away (breath away)
So sexy, but to me
You take my breath away (breath away)

Foxy &amp; free
You take my breath away (breath away)
So sexy, but to me
You take my breath away (breath away)

Foxy
