Baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you
Even though I can't forgive you
I really want to
I want you

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cuz even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without you
I've got one less problem without ya
One less problem without ya
I've got one less problem without ya
One less problem without ya

No you'll never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you

Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without you
I've got one less problem without ya
One less problem without ya
I've got one less problem without ya
One less problem without you
I've got one less problem

Smart money bettin'
I'll be better off without you
In no time
I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Biggy Iggy
To the biggie, biggie stressin'
Thinkin' the thought of you
More than I love your presence
The best thing now
Was probably for you to exit
I let you go
Let you back
Finally learned my lesson

I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I've got one less problem without ya
One less problem without ya
I've got one less problem without ya
I've got one less problem <i>[x3]</i>
Problem
I've got one less
