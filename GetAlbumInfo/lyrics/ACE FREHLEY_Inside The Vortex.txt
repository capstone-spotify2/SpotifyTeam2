<i>[Verse:]</i>
Travelin' through the ages
Moving through space and time
Catching a glimpse of
What I can find

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Inside the Vortex
It's so sublime

<i>[Verse:]</i>
My life's gone through changes
Somehow I survived
My universe faded
But now I'm alive

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Inside the Vortex
Baby, it's so sublime

<i>[Verse:]</i>
Passing by constellations
Seeing comets fly by

Inside the Vortex
Yeah, it's so sublime
Within the Vortex
I'll make you mine

Inside the Vortex
Baby, it's so sublime
Within' the vortex
You know I feel alive
