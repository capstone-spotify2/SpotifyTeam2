Sitting quietly watching the ticking on the wall
She sits patiently, she thinks maybe the world will fall
She says, "I feel at times like I had it and lost it all"
But there are walls are in her eyes

Waiting, she says, is the hardest thing to do
You don't feel like somebody else and you don't feel like you
Sometimes the light around me has the strangest hue
And I wonder what I'm going through

And she's on fire, and her whole world is burning
Yeah, she's on fire, and it feels like her whole world just keeps turning
She says, "I'm so full of doubt, I don't know if I'll ever find a way out
Feels like something I read in a book somewhere
I've been thinking, you know I've been thinking
I've thought myself into the ground, I've been thinking
That I'm sinking."

(Here we go)

Lonely I take through and my mind begins to soar <i>[?]</i>
She talked to anyone, so it's anyone she told
There's an empty chair at the end of an empty hall
And she feels small

Faces smile, she's moving through a crowd
The sun is shining but it's hiding a cloud
She laughs from time to time but she feels a little loud
And she would cry but she's too proud

And she's on fire and her whole world is burning
Yeah, she's on fire, and it feels like her whole world just keeps turning
She says, "I'm so full of doubt, I don't know if I'll ever find a way out
Feels like something I read in a book somewhere
I've been thinking, you know I've been thinking
I've thought myself into the ground, I've been thinking
That I'm sinking."

And you want to tell her that she's gonna be fine
And you want to tell her that the light hurts when you've been blind
She says "all I see stretching out before me is time"
She says, "All I see stretching out before me is time"
Oh, and you want to tell her that she's gonna be fine
Oh, woman, you're drinking your sorrows like wine, now
Ohhh, woman, don't you know that you're going to be fine?
Don't you know that you're going to be fine?
