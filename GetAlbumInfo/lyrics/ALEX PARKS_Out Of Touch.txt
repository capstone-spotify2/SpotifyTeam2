Sleep my baby the planets line up in your mind
As you sleep my baby
Your souls in line you'll be just fine

So sort out, guess what I'm out of touch
You're out of reach my darling you're safe in sleep could I
Leave you step by step
You're out my reach
I felt pain once
Hurt you, out of touch
Turn away now I hear you cry you're lost in time as I
Start to fly now 
Your soul is mine I'll be just fine
I soared up
Guess I'm out of touch
You're out of reach my darling
You're safe in sleep
Could I leave you? Step by step
You're out my reach
I felt pain once
Put you, out of touch
Put you out of touch
I'll apologise guilty as...no surprise

You're out of reach my darling 
You're safe in sleep
Could I leave you? Step by step
You're out my reach 
I felt pain once
Put you out of touch
