What you gonna do when you get back home?
Get a job?
Pull your weight now?
What you gonna do when she sees through your eyes?
And through your lies?
Can you tell me?

What you gonna do when she calls your name?
Oh high priestess, can you help me?
What you gonna do when you get outta jail?
Oh high priestess, can you save me?
And listen to my prayer

Listen to my prayer...

What you gonna do when you get back home?
From a slow, long journey
Priestess sitting up on a golden throne
She says no
You better get what you came for
And listen to yourself

Listen to your...
