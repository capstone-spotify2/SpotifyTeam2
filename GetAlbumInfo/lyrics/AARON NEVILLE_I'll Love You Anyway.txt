Like a river running still
Slowly drifting to the sea
Like the cool blue light 
That crushes the sky at morning
You can always count on me

Some things never change
But love is the one thing that remains

You can break my heart,
You can trade my pride,
Say that love has seen it's day
Take my world apart,
Say you've changed your mind,
I will love you anyway

It's a complicated business
And the feelings come and go
But there's a simple truth
That will keep you through the hard times
It's not what you feel, it's what you know

I know how much I love you
Yes, and I know you love me too

You can break my heart,
You can take my pride,
Tell me love has seen it's day
Break my world apart
You can change your mind
Girl, I'll love you anyway

Old days will fade away
Love is the one thing,
It's the one thing that remains

You can break my heart,
You can trade my pride, 
Say that love has gone away
Take my world apart,
You can change your mind,
I will love you anyway

You can break my heart, 
you can break my heart,
Trade my pride,
Tell me love has seen it's day
Break my world apart,
You can change your mind,
I will love you anyway

Oooh,
Tell me love has seen it's day
Break my world apart,
Change your mind,
I will love you anyway
