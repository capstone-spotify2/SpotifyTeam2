Have
You felt the pain
Of a love so deep you think
Your heart might break
Has someone touched your soul
So deep inside
Did you feel your whole world stop
The moment that
You looked into their eyes
Oh do you know what
It's like

Do you know the way it feels
When you love someone so bad
You can't think of nothing else
But the touch of their hand
And you wonder what the way but no you know you can't
Do you know the way it feels

Have you had those nights
When you can't sleep
'Cause a picture of their face
Is all you see
You know you need that love
Like you need air
And you find it hard to breathe
Sometimes when you
Just let you see them there
Oh you know it's just
Not fair

Do you know the way it feels
When you love someone so bad
You can't think of nothing else
But the touch of their hand
And you wonder what the way but no you know you can't
Do you know the way it feels

Do you
Have a clue
What I'm
Going through
Do you know
What it's like when feel like your just about to lose your mind, baby

Do you know the way it feels
When you love someone so bad
You can't think of nothing else
But the touch of their hand
And you wonder what the way but no you know you can't
Do you know the way it feels
When you love someone so bad
You can't think of nothing else
But the touch of your hand
And you wonder what the way but no I know I can't
Do you know the way it feels
Way if feels
