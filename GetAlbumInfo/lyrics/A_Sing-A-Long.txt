Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

I think I'm trouble, there's always a couple
Around me wherever I go
They're out there to bug me
I don't think it's funny
Everybody's laughing at me yeah

I wanna go out, but there's no one about
All my friends want a quiet one at home
They're that same age as me
And their husbands to be yeah
Everybody in the building

Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

I make a move here, and I make a move there
I've got millions of things on the go
I'll write me the best lines, they're too corny sometimes
Everybody's laughing at me

Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

And now when I find her, there's rings on her finger
I'll try every trick in the book
And I've got some more pride, I've got time on my side
Everybody's gone without me yeah

Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
