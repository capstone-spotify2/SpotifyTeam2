Taste, you left a bitter taste in my mouth that will never heal to sub-reveal,
Unkind, can never rewind, you play the part that's so unreal
repercussions now pay the price

Watch me walk away done talking now,
pigeons burning yesterday, wont put them out
Never heard a single word, done talking now
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now

I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive

You're always on the ride, your adversaries love the view,
signed and sealed lost sight, cannot lead the blind
You point your finger filled with steel, your future deal denied

Watch me walk away done talking now,
pigeons burning yesterday, wont put them out
Never heard a single word, done talking now
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now

I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive

You've been riding so high on one big lie all these years
Denied all my pride never thought you'd hear all these years
So crystal clear your promising tears we all did these years,
All these years
All these years

Watch me walk away done talking now,
pigeons burning yesterday, it won't happen now

I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive

(At the same time)
Watch me walk away done talking now,
pigeons burning yesterday, wont put them out
Never heard a single word, done talking now
Try to get through to me, It won't happen now

I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive
