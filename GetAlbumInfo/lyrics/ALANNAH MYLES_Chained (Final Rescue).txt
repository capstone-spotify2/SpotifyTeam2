Watch out for rescue
I should have known
When I was in danger
At least I was on my own

Watch out for rescue
Don't wanna be saved
Won't be your mama
Won't be your slave

I was doing okay
Livin' in danger, livin' alone

At home with a stranger
Nobody's master bater
Nobody's slave, the final rescue

Don't wanna be chained, ah
Don't wanna be seen that way, ah, ah

Watch out for heroes
Lookin' for deeds
Beware of crusaders needin'
Meetin' your needs

Watch out for fixers
That are not even broke
They save you with chains
And with wedding rings

And now I'm home
At home with a stranger
Nobody's master bater
Nobody's slave, the final rescue

Don't wanna be chained, ah
Don't wanna be seen that way, ah
Don't wanna be changed, ah

Watch out for rescuers
Comin' in my door
Beware of saviors
I've been here before

Oh, they come in Camaros
To save your skin
Well, they save you from danger
You're not even in

Watch out for heroes
Lookin' for a deed
Beware of crusaders
Eetin' your need

Watch out for fixers
When you're not even broke

Don't wanna be chained, ah
Don't wanna be seen that way, ah
Don't wanna be changed, ah
Don't wanna be chained, ah, ah
