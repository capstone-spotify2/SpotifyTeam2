Hey, look out yonder, what's that I see?
Well, that old bogus honey coming after me
I thought you told her I was out of town
I wonder how she knowed I was hangin' around?
Say listen baby, don't go wastin' your time
You keep a-comin' 'round you'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys you say you need 'em
You take what's good for you and I'll take my freedom

'Cause lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet
Ooh, yes it has
And honey, your heading down a one way street
And I gotta go the other way

I thought I knew her, my cagey lady
How could my sunshine be so damn shady?
She'll say she'll love to talk a conversation
But I'm the one that makes my situation
This one way city that I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey, that's it for you

Because lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet
And honey, your heading down a one way street
I just gotta go the other way

You know what I'm talkin' about, baby
I seen that butterfly you tried to put on your can
I'm gonna get me some a that

Ah, there's nothin' over here I never showed ya
I made it pretty clear I'm glad to know ya
You know your brother Spike, he's on the level
But you always lookin' like your mad at the devil
Don't say I cop a 'tude, it's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude, your fruits are rotten
You know I work so hard to keep it alive
Now all I hear from you is nothin' but jive

Because lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet, hey
And Honey, your heading down a one way street
And I gotta go the other way, yes I do

Yeah, oh, lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet
And Honey, your heading down a one way street
And I really do feel that I got to be movin' on

Hey hey hey um hey
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey oh baby
And your heading down a one way street
Yeah, you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said your heading down a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said your heading down a one way street
Well, you're foolin' everybody but me
I said your heading down a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said your heading down a one way street
When you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said your heading down a one way street
When you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said your heading down a one way street
You got to get yourself back on your feet
Well, no baby, fooling everybody you meet

Oh, baby, humming everybody
Chewing everybody
Booting everybody
Loving everybody
Licking everybody you meet
