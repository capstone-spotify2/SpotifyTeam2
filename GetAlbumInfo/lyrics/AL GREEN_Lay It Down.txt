Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
put your head on the floor
lay it down, lay it down, lay it down

I just met you, just the other day
Everything started flowing my way

I just love you... really I just love you for yourself
I don't want no, no, no no no no nobody else
Hey lay it down

lay it down, let it go, fall in love
lay it down, let it go, fall in love
lay it down, let it go, fall in love

(One more thang)
your love is a wonder to me
I just love you, really, I would really love you for free

All I want to do (all I want to do)
I don't want you to change your mind
I love you baby in your time
Hey lay it down

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love

See I love you, you see, I love you before my self
you're everything I need, everything I need
ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Ever since I started holding your hand
I've never, I've never seen such a smiling man
you made me happy baby

I almost, I almost I wrapped up
When I see you, I want to love you more, and more, and more
Hey lay it down

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
