Now I never thought that I'd be losing sleep at night
Over you now I don't know what to do
I promised myself that I would not cry
Over you now I feel it all inside

Thoughts of you
Keep driving me crazy
And if I don't sleep
Then it won't even faze me
Some people call it love
I call it sprung on you - ooh baby

Here we go
Here we go
I'm coming again
You got me messed up
I'm sprung on it

<i>[Chorus]</i>

I thought it would be easy

To get over you
Now I see that it's not in me
I think I'm going crazy
Going out of my mind trying to find
Someone to take your place

Thoughts of you
Keep driving me crazy
And if I don't sleep
Then it won't even faze me
Some people call it love
I call it sprung on you - ooh baby

When I'm all alone
There ain't nothing I can do
All I do is think of you
Ain't about to take my mind off you
You got me going round and round
My whole world's upside down
Let me love you, let me love you
Uhmmmm...here we go

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
