Day I met God, I got so carried away
Day I met God, I got so carried away
Not with the vision, but the streaks in his hair
Not with religion, but the size of his knob

The day I met God
The day I met God
It was pissing with rain
And we went 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo

Day I met God, I got so carried away
Day I met God, I got so carried away
Not with the vision, but the streaks in his hair
Not with the vicars, or the nuns or the priests 

The day I met God
The day I met the big boy, yeah
It was pissing with rain
And we went 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo

And the herald angels sang
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo.... 

The day I met God
The day I met God
The day I met God
The day I met the big boy, yeah
It was pissing with rain
And we went 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-hoo

We were coming back in the van
From Milan 
And I saw God
Right there
