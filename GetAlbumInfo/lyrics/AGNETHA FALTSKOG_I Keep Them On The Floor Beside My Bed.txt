I knew I had to leave that day
I couldn't take it anymore
Yes, I had it all by then
But I lost myself somehow
Well who cares what I do now

I never thought I'd hurt this much
My heart would break so easily
I'm a fool and that's a fact
I'm a fool now I can see
Our love was meant to be

The memory starts to flow
The picture is me and you
I keep them on the floor beside my bed
The images rewind
I loose myself in time
The movie still playes on inside my head

You're always here
That's how it seems
I feel you even in my dreams
I should have stayed and worked it out
That's what love is all about
Instead I left you all alone

Oh! The memory starts to flow
The picture is me and you
I keep them on the floor beside my bed
Summer nights together
Walking hand in hand
Why is love so hard to understand
To understand

I should have stayed and worked it out
That's what love is all about
Instead I left you all alone

The memory starts to flow
The picture is me and you
I keep them on the floor beside my bed
The images rewind
I loose myself in time
The movie still players on inside my head
The memory starts to flow
The picture is me and you
I keep them on the floor beside my bed
Summer nights together
walking hand in hand
Why is love so hard to understand
