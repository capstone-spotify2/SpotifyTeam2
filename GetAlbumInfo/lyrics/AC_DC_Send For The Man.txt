Do you want love
Dirty dirty love
Do you want lust
Just a little lust
You want a bad reputation
You wanna better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door

Send for the man
Send for the man

You like a dream
Dirty low and mean
You're good enough to eat
You're sticky hot and sweet
Need a shot of rhythm and loving
You make a black sheep a ram
This ain't no gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand

Send for the man
Send for the man

Send for the man

Send for the man
Keep away from that decadent Dan
Send for the man
He won't give a damn

Send for the man, Send for the man
Send for the man, Send for the man
