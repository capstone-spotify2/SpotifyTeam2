And it will take a little bit of extra time
To make it shine, to make it shine 
And it will take a little bit of extra care 
To bring it where you think it's there 

And there's no one else around 
This is what I've found Anyone you see 
Anyone you meet 
Some one at your feet 
Anyone could be that one 
Anyone you know 
Anywhere you go 
Some one in a show 
Could be that one

And it will take a little bit of all you've got
To get a shot, get a shot 
And it will take a little bit of extra care 
To bring it where you think it's there

And there's nowhere else to go 
This is what I know 
Anyone you see 
Anyone you meet 
Maybe down the street 
Anyone could be that one 
Everywhere you look
Pages of a book
All the years it took 
Everything got you down 

And it will take a little while to get back home 
The road is long, the road is long
And it will take a little work to get it back 
To mend the cracks, to bridge the gaps

Anyone you see 
Could be the one 
Anyone you meet 
Could be that one 
Some one at your feet
Could feel the same
Maybe you'd complete 
Could share your name
Anywhere you look
Pages of a book 
Everything she took
Never let it keep you down 

Holding out for used 
Broken up and bruised
Losable to lose
Anywhere you go 
Anyone you know 
Think it doesn't show 
Everybody knows 
Anyone you meet 
Maybe down the street 
(And it will take a little time to get back home) 
Some one at you feet
