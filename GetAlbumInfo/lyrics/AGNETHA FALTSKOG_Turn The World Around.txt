Now you and I descended
On a world with innocent hopes
We traveled that criss-crossed highway
And cascaded down the slopes.

It's time to look at who we are
And let the feelings show
It's time to leave the past now
And grow.

I've listened to endless voices
I've proceeded with endless tact
I've figured in endless numbers
And I've worked on the traits I lacked.

I've come too far, the time is right
The devil's made his pact
It's time to stop pretending
And act.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

Oh, turn the world around
Don't you limit your ranges
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

Oh, turn the world around
Don't you limit your ranges
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of (tomorrow's out of)
Tomorrow's out of sight.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

Oh, turn the world around
Don't you limit your ranges
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of (tomorrow's out of)
Tomorrow's out of sight.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight...
