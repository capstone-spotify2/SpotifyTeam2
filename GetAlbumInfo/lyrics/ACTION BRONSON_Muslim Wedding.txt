Should have brought that wasabi
That horseradish
Cubed up
Fuckin' sniffin' that horseradish

Yo I'm the young Laird Hamilton
Hoppin' out the chopper
Scorin' like I'm Messi but this game is far from soccer
Giambi on the lenses and the juice is from the doctor
Jar still full of drugs
An 80s Caddy painted aqua
Take these and freeze they nose
Dick sucked by a seasoned pro
Info on the need to know
Motherfucker you don't need to know
Gimme trees to blow
I keep the caesar low
I want the head, the shoulders, and the knees and toes
From the hottest summer to the freezing snow
Mind higher then a bleeding nose
I'm Bobby Fischer
Check mate
You're like a Spanish Roasted Chicken
Break your chest plate
And yes I just ate
I keep that napkin near me
My favorite uncle went to summer camp for racketeering

Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading

This be that whore house visitor
Watch em' while they scissor
103 your Roosevelt
Fancy on the shoes and belt
Nasty pussy tuna melt
Stinky like a China street
You're bound to find me where the corporate and the grimy meet
Lay flat on designer sheet
She kept asking me to grind her grease
So I pound a freak like a pound of meat
Top dog cause I hound the street
I'm makin' poopy on your head cause this is easy
Old Italian men inside the kitchen making cheeses

Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
