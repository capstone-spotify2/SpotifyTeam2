365 little lies we have written in our mind.
2.5 kids by 25 and youâre doing just fine.
Weâve been wired for it, but weâre tired of it.
Oh, weâre looking for something more.
365 different ways we can choose to live our lives.

Oooh, tell me what youâre gonna do.
Oooh, what have you got to lose?
Itâs now or itâs never. We donât have forever, no.
Oooh, itâs time for you to make your move.

Oh, donât you know itâs dangerous when you try to play it safe?
You live in boxes 9 to 5 always hoping for a raise.
Itâs enough for getting by, but tell me, does it make you happy? 
Youâve put your dreams on hold too long. Why wait another day?

Oooh, tell me what youâre gonna do.
Oooh, what have you got to lose?
Itâs now or itâs never. We donât have forever, no.
Oooh, itâs time for you to make your move.

We are all the same! And, we are all afraid!
We are all the same! Oh, we are all afraid!
We are all the same! (Take a step now!)
Oh, we are all afraid! (Gotta make it happen!)
Oh, we are all the same! (Whatcha waiting for?)
Oh, we are all afraid!

Oooh, tell me what youâre gonna do.
Oooh, what have you got to lose?
Itâs now or itâs never. We donât have forever, no.
Oooh, itâs time for you to make your move.

(It's now or it's never. We don't have forever.) <i>[x4]</i>
