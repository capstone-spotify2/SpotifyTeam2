Could be your eyes, could be your smile. 
Could be the way you freed my mind.

Your precious touch caressed my soul. 
You gave me everything I need, and know I'll lost. 
Lost forever.

<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i>
Lost forever, and you said this is going nowhere, girl. 
And you said I turned my back on. 
You said I'll not the only one for you.

Please give me one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up.
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you.

Could be the lies, could be my pride. 
Could be the days and nights so wild. 

Could be the times I wasn't there. 
And all the nights we didn't share, and now you've lost. 
Lost forever

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
<i>[Chorus]</i>

I can't sleep, I can't live without you by my side. 
So cold, so lost without as my guide. 
You made me realise I've nothing, nothing without you.

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Baby give me one last try
