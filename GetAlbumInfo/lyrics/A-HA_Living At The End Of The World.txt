Sometimes it leaves me with fear
Never saw the horizon this near
Look to the left then to the right
I tuck you in and kiss you goodnight

See there is something I know
We are not whom weâre told
We are more than weâll never know

And weâre living at the end of the world
Forget about all that youâve heard
Living our dreams on the highway
Itâs just another day
No matter what they say or youâve heard
Weâre living on top of the world
Weâre living our dreams on the highway
No matter what they say
Itâs just another day

I hear your heart beat in the night
You are like an echo of light
But in times when shallow runs deep
Your golden beauty goes cheap
Still there is something I know
Something yet to unfold
And we are more than weâll never know

And weâre living at the end of the world
Forget about all that youâve heard
Living our dreams on the highway
Itâs just another day
No matter what they say or youâve heard
Weâve made it to the top of the world
Building up speed on the highway
Weâve made it to the end
Living at the end of the world

Forget about all that youâve heard
No matter what they say or youâve heard
Weâve made it to the top of the world
Building up speed on the highway
Weâve made it to the end of the world
