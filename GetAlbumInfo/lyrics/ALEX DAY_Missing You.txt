Have I done
Alll I can
To make you
Understand

What if I
Fell asleep
Would you lie
There with me

Iâm just missing you
Iâm just missing you

How did you
Get inside
Only to
Say goodbye

I want you
More than you know
Thatâs the only thing I know

Iâm just missing you
Iâm just missing you

Iâm getting over you tonight
Wonât wait for you to ask me what Iâm doing
Cos Iâll throw my inhibitions to the wind
Iâm strong and I donât need this anymore
All I have to do is close the door

And Iâll stop missing you
Iâll stop missing you
Iâll stop missing you

Iâm on your side
And I always will be
Keeping the hair out of your eyes
And your face is close to mine
And I canât think straight
Because I can feel your breath on me
When you speak itâs in a whisper and every moment counts

I know Iâm missing you
I know Iâm missing you
I know Iâm missing you
I know Iâm missing you

But if I didnât miss you
It wouldnât be worth it in the end

Have I done
Alll I can
To make you
Understand
