Come on weather man give us a forecast snowy white
Can't you hear the prayers of every child like heart tonight
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep

Another tender Tennessee Christmas,
The only Chirstmas for me
Where the love circles around us
Like the gifts around our tree
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado
Than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me

Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel Town's for me
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting,
Still I think I'm gonna keep

Another tender Tennessee Christmas,
It's the only Christmas for me
Where the love circles around us
Like the gifts around our tree
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday,
It's the only place to be
A tender Tennessee Christmas,
It's the only Christmas to me

It's the only Christmas to me

Come on let us have
An every now and then
A tender Tennessee Christmas

Tender Tennessee Christmas
