Feelings, nothing more than feelings,
Trying to forget my feelings of love
Teardrops rolling down on my face,
Trying to forget my feelings of love

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl
You'll never come again
Feelings, whoa feelings,

Oh oh my darling
Whoa, feelings again in my heart
Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you

Oh my darl oh my darl
Again in my life
Feelings, all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl

You'll never come again
Feelings, oh my darl, oh my darling
Feelings oh my darling
Feelings again in my heart

Feelings, feelings
