You took my hand and you never let go
Well I was so sure but now I just don't know
You've got me thinking
You've got me thinking about you

Because you
You played my heart
Took my love
Did you plan this from the start?

Stop!
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking that these fights
They don't mean a thing to me
Who are you to be the judge of what I should be

And here we go yeah we're at it again
Wish I could say that we were more than friends
'Cause I've been dreaming
I've been dreaming about you (about you)

Because you
You played my heart
Took my love
Did you plan this from the start?

And if I could do it over again
I'd do anything to be yours in the end

Stop!
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking that these fights
They don't mean a thing to me
Who are you to be the judge of what I should be

Stop!
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking that these fights
They don't mean a thing to me
Who are you to be the judge of what I should be

When I looked into your eyes I saw what we should be
You may not care anymore, but you meant every thing to me

Stop
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking
That these fights
They don't mean a thing to...

Stop!
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking that these fights
They don't mean a thing to me
Who are you to be the judge of what I should be

Stop!
Just take a while
I won't wait another night for you to call
'Cause lately I've been thinking that these fights
They don't mean a thing to me
Who are you to be the judge of what I should be...
