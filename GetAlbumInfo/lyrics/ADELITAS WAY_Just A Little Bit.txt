I'm feeling disillusioned
And I can't stop thinking about you now
Your sex is so diluted
And your love will put me in the ground
Until you take it away
Turn all this love into hate
And then you leave me here dying

You're heartless stop this
Give me just a little bit
I could be your star
Let me take a hit of it
Give me just a little bit
I could be your lie today

This power's an illusion
You can't stop thinking 'bout me now
I let you think I'm losing this time
I got you figured out
It's an addiction to you
But it's a habit I choose
I even like when you're lying

You're heartless stop this
Give me just a little bit
I could be your star
Let me take a hit of it
Give me just a little bit
I could be your lie today

I'm feeling disillusioned

You're heartless stop this
Give me just a little bit
I could be your star
Let me take a hit of it
Give me just a little bit
I could be your lie today

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
I could be your star
Just take a hit of it
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
I could be your lie today
Just take a hit of it
Just a little bit

You're heartless stop this
Give me just a little bit
I could be your star
Let me take a hit of it
Give me just a little bit
