Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night
'Cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star
(Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...)

I'm a young single man at the age 25
Ex-communist, I search American life.
I have no cash, I have no job
But I don't give a damn as long as music is my world.

Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night
'Cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star
(Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...) <i>[x5]</i>

She's a hot sexy lady, skin is dark, dress is white
Driving a jag, California tag
She has the moves, she has the style
But I don't give a damn as long as music is my life.

Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night
'Cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star
(Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...) <i>[x8]</i>

Get up, get up (Get up, get up) <i>[repeats]</i>

<i>[x3:]</i>
Probably Madonna is the queen of disco
Time goes by so slowly

Probably Madonna is the queen of disco
Oh baby, I'm the king of dÃ¯sco...
