Grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all you cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 

I've been working real hard 
For just one reason 
I've been waiting all year 
For just one season 
The season that reminds me of palm trees 
The smell, the ocean breeze 
And the sense of being free 
Barbecues and pool parties 
What I call fun 

Hanging with the honey's 
And enjoying the sun 
Spendin' 4 hours just to clean the Benz 
So you can cruise down the 
boulevard with your friends 

Sights on the beach have got your mind blowing 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowing 
Right here is where you belong 
So if your down with me 
Get up and come along 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all your cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 

Had to take a sip of Ma's Homemade 
Freshly squeezed lemonade 
Check out the honeys in my brand new shades 
As they lay on the sand 
Topping up on the tans 
Take in the scenery 
The mood is fine 
Nobody's wearing their watches 
Nobody's checking the time 
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mine 
That's the summer the summer 
the summertime 

Sights on the beach have got 
your mind blowing 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowing 
Right here is where you belong 
So if your down with me 
Get up and come along 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all your cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
for the summertime 

Right now we're going to bring it to you one time 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride,
Leaving all you cares right behind 
Everybody is feeling the vibe 
of the summer, of the summer 

Grab your bags and lets go back inside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
But didn't we have a good time? 

Destinations home, that's where we're going 
the drinks are gone and the cash stopped flowing 
say goodnight to all of your friends 
'cause when tomorrow comes 
we're going to do it all again 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all your cares right behind

Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe
