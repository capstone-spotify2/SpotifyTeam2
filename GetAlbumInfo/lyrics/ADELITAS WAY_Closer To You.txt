As you walk my way
Do you see my face
Sad behind a smile
Fake it for awhile
Tell me what should I do?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

As I stand alone
Sinking like a stone
You can save me now
I can't live without
Tell me what should I do?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

If you walked my way
Would you see my face?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

To get closer to you
And all I do
To get closer to you
And all I do
To get closer to you
And all I do
