Today's the fourth of July
Another June has gone by
And when they light up our town
I just think what a waste of gunpowder and sky

I'm certain I am alone
In harbouring thoughts of our home
It's one of my faults that I can't quell my past
I ought to have gotten it gone

Oh, baby
I wonder if when you are older
Someday
You'll wake up and say
"My God, I should have told her
What would it take?
But now here I am and the world's gotten colder
And she's got the river down which I sold her"

So that's today's memory lane
With all the pathos and pain
Another chapter in a book where the chapters are endless
And they're always the same
A verse, then a verse, and refrain

Oh, baby
I wonder if when you are older
Someday
You'll wake up and say
"My God, I should have told her
What would it take?
But now here I am and the world's gotten colder
And she's got the river down which I sold her..."
