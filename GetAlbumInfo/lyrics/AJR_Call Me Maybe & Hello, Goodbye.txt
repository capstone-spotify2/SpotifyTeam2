I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way

<i>[Ryan:]</i>
You say yes, and I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no
You say goodbye and I say

<i>[Jack:]</i>
To call me maybe!
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!

And all the other girls,
They try to chase me,
But here's my number,

<i>[Ryan:]</i>
So I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

<i>[Adam:]</i>
You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way

<i>[Ryan:]</i>
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh
You say goodbye and I say
To call me maybe!

<i>[Jack:]</i>
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!

And all the other girls,
They try to chase me,
But here's my number,

<i>[Ryan:]</i>
So I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

<i>[Jack:]</i>
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
And you should know know that

(So call me maybe)

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!

And all the other girls,
They try to chase me,
But here's my number,

<i>[Ryan:]</i>
So I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
