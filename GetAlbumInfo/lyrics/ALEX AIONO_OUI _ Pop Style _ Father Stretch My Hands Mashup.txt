If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate, is warm long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Baby, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Baby, there's no we

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich,
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one sh-,
All my people wanna do is pop style, pop style
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, 
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it, 
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started.
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no..body
They still out to get me cause they never got 

Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted, yeah
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted, yeah
Just want to feel liberated, I, 
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated Iâm sorry

Yeah, look, I know youâre so independent and I know Iâm a little different,
from most of the dudes that you talk to I wonât let that be a limit,
Yeah I might be young but Iâm faithful I would never tell you something that ainât true,
yeah I would send you funny posts you relate to, we could go to Disneyland on a date too,
I just wanna get to know you better, like âwhatâs your favorite color?â,
tell me bout your brother and your sister and your mother,
tell me all the things you like to do in the summer, thatâs cool..
maybe we can do a couple, give me the chance and Iâll be all you need,
girl if me and you were a couple I would be sure that youâre living the dream, 

Girl let me rock body
I just want to feel liberated, oh, yea, ah yea, I...
