Why are the worldâs biggest sinners
Always saints when theyâre gone?
Itâs all about losers and winners
Not about whoâs right and who is wrong

Whoâs the thief, whoâs the traitor?
Whoâs the one to save the day?
And who will be in the spotlight
While the good ones fade away

Yes I realize itâs just a fact of life
Nothingâs ever really free
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
We canât escape our destiny

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour

No more Mr Nice Guy
No more Mr Right
Should I be like all the others?
Should I give up the good fight?

This never-ending struggle
Has been part of me so long
Is it a curse is it a blessing?
We know whoâs right, who is wrong

Iâm not complaining this is how I lived my life
I(âll) keep my pride my dignity
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
You canât cheat your destiny

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour

Yes I realize itâs just a fact of life
Nothingâs ever really free
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
You canât cheat your destiny

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour

Itâs the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
