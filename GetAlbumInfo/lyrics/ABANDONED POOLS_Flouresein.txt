Wipe away the summer air
You don't wanna see
That's you in that Photograph from 1973
And you don't even know me

God only Knows I wanna be
The other side of misery
Gimme a plate of Fluorescein
I'm gonna paint an ugly scene
All of the things I wanna say
Can't get a word out anyway
Falling away after today
Nothing to lose so come what may

Don't wake me

You got away from me somehow
And all we tried to be
Everything is different now
The mind's eye fails to see
And all we know is TV
