I know of a tavern not far from here
Where you can get some mighty fine beer
The company's true and the wenches are pretty
It's the greatest damn place in the whole of the city
If you're looking for crewmates, you'll sure find 'em there
Cutthroats and lowlifes and worse i should dare
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debauchery violence and sin

So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's Harbour Cafe

If you're looking to go on a glorious quest
There's a man there who knows of an old treasure chest
For some pieces of eithe an a tankard of ale
He'll show you the map and tell you it's tale
And then there's Nancy, the lovely barmaiden
She may be old but her beauty ain't fading
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debaucher violence and sin

So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's Harbour CafÃ©
