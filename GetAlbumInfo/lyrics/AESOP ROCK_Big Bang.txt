Well, so we meet again 
(He said he's grown spiritually since the last time) 

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects 
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedigods last flesh 
Poison functions accompanied by six armorclad 
Black horse and buggy mechanism 
Tucked the portion of my severed vision 
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket 
Wit a shoestring budget 
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now) 
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen 
Fee fie etcetera 
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin 
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone 
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin to paddle back home 
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention 
By eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences 
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering 
Now when the groom presents the ring 
The bride commence to blistering 
This textbook magnificently prude 
Prototype king beserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal 
Treasure (treasure), loose cannons span the starboard bow of
The clippership dipped in truth famine pressure 
Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous 
Beautiful cartoon trooper swallow Buddha futility with a teaspoon full of sugar 
I rock ready aim fire, when ya'll rock ready fire aim 
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge marksman, or poacher, it's all the same 
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be 
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see or hear a 'Yes sir, sir' 
YES SIR! 
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone 
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn 
Big bang, shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams, I think big things 
I'm a burn with this little light of mine
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'm a be a big bang 
<i>[repeat except 1st line is 'I wanna be a big bang, gotta be']</i>

I'm just a survivor of the wooly mammoth population 
Bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf 
Alien of shallow alchemy 
If you gon' metamorph the basemetal to precious 
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the pesants 
I'm floating the homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window 
Left an SOS infested bottle nested in his grip so 
With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow 

I observed him fly ten feet then drop the bottles to the devils 
Fertile circle turn fertile crescent via bad investment 
Despised every second, but I GUESS I LEARNED MY LESSON! 
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim 
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system 
Sticky panoramic contaminant planet 
In conjunction with phantom assumption 
Gutterbug alumnus candidates 
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse 
Just to help guide in your ship 
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch) 
Godspeed, straitjacket and ragged approach 
To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly 
From a BC generation disgust 
Community movement alluding to a 
'No blood given, no recognition' 
Life matter, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer 
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams have gathered 
But uh, that certain lack of avail 
I sail a choppy lot with bouancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks) 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>

Big bang, bi-big bang 
It's gettin bigger by the second 
Check it 

Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the others farewell 
I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similars repel 
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals 
I'm broken arrow to the f**kin bone (broken poem) 
I don't really believe in God 
But God, I'm scared to death of God 
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans 
Nor tear the Pod 
It's like I hike an acre unimpressed 
And slept on the sabre's edge 
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge 
I wanna know myself 
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves 
And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls

I push the ghouls to man overboard 
Pull the bulls onto my sword 
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor 
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar 
Got a mug of frigid, got a mug of solar, sliiidde over 
The recipe's design unplug the appetite for continuity 
By stitching together an esteemed congruence (beautifully) 
I peel back hearts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers 
Cauterized the wounded heads like 'Gimme gimme something major' 
Road side prophetic, ascend well 
Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system 
Blistering in a wishing well 
BIG BANG!
