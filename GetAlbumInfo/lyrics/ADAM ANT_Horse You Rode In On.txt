A young lady once decided 
That she was sick of stupid boys
So she threw quite a dancing party
Plenty of juice and lots of noise

When a young man asked her a question
In her bed what she had on?
When she replied "a pair of head phones"
You know the dear young boy was gone

Mister what did you say your name was
For I would hate to get it wrong
If you don't like it leave our party
And the horse you rode in on

After a while this girl was cornered 
And a big man scared her to death
Wanted to know what she held on to
In her bed, she smiled and said: "her breath"

As the boys got a little louder
Tried to see how far they could go
Asked her what she liked to have on in bed
She said "the radio"

Mister what did you say your name was
For I would hate to get it wrong
If you don't like it leave our party
And the horse you rode in on

Mister what did you say your name was
For I would hate to get it wrong
If you don't like it leave our party
And the horse you rode in on
