Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me, to lay down with at night

The colors of spring, are vivid and green
Since I looked, so deep in your eyes
All of a sudden, I'm filled with emotion
With feelings, I used to deny

Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me, to lay down with at night

You've given me purpose, and reason to worship
Someone much stronger than me
Gentle and tender, and always remember
The little things, a man really needs

Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me, to lay down with at night

As time moves along, I know we'll belong
To each other, 'till they lay me down
And when even then, I'll take your memory with me
To hold me, when you're not around

Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me, to lay down with at night
