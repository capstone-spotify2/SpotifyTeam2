Some people call me a walkin' disaster
Just a waitin' for a place to occur
But I still got enough that'll last her
Till the blood gets ready to burn

My meter's running, still got a lot of livin' to do
I live five days to your one
And you know it's true, yeah!

(Listen!) I got money, got fame
Got everything to play this game
No sorrow, no shame
Cuz nothin' matters when you're INSANE

It's never easy being the crazy
Just a job someone's got to do
Take a number and stand in the line
For the good life you never knew

My meter's running, still got a lot of livin' to do
I live five days to your one
And you know it's true, yeah!

(Listen!) I got money, got fame
Got everything to play this game
No sorrow, no shame
Cuz nothin' matters when you're INSANE
