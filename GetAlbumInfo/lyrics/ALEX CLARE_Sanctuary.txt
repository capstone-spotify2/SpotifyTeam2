You left me broken
So many tears I cried for you.
Tried to understand
all that we've been through

Lost, confused
Is this hope? Abuse?
I'll still shelter you,
keep you warm
Protect you from the storm
Holding you close to my heart

I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your open arms
and I will find sanctuary

Wrapped around you
The whole world just disappears
Time stands still when I'm with you
A moment feels like years

I feel confused
There's so much to lose.
My head is fighting with my heart,
it feels so torn apart

Holding you close to my heart

I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your open arms
and I will find sanctuary

Just making it up as I go along
Feels so right when I'm with you,
but I know it's wrong.

I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your arms
I will find sanctuary in your open arms
and I will find sanctuary.
