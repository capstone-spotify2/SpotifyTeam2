I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'd be satisfied now to gain one single thing

Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
I want my baby, tonight baby, I can't wait no longer
Here now baby

I give my heart and feeling of distress
Trying to ignore her pain, all the happiness
Anything you want girl, I will give complete
I'd do anything, baby, to overcome defeat

And don't say tomorrow come, it don't belong to anyone
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, oh baby, hey, c'mon

I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'll be satisfied to gain one single thing

Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, baby
I can't wait no longer, comin' over baby
