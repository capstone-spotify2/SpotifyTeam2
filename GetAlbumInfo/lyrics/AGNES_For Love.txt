I know I put you to the test again 
Like so many times before 
Your starting to loose your faith in me 
I know it's time for me to start to show 
I'm not gonna let you go 
We're not going down just take a good look in my eyes 

I live my life alone I'd tried to get it right 
And steer somehow, I always end up 
Breaking up and ? slowing down the line 
But I don't know why cause your everything in my life 
And I can't go on without having you by my side 
So please don't go away 

I know you say that I'm so far away 
But my life is complete right here 
No matter what I but you trough 
And I know it's time for me start to show 
I'm not gonna let you go 
I gave you my soul just take a good look in my eyes 

I live my life alone I'd tried to get it right 
And steer somehow, I always end up 
Breaking up and ? slowing down the line 
But I don't know why cause your everything in my life 
And I can't go on without having you by my side 
If we end I now, there's no reason to carry on 
So please don't go 

It's time to say goodbye to the crazy things I've done 
And put it all behind cause I live my life for love 
Listen to me when I say, hey I live my life for love 
Listen to me when I say, I'm not gonna let you go 
We're not going down just take a good look in my eyes 

I live my life alone I'd tried to get it right 
And steer somehow, I always end up 
Breaking up and ? slowing down the line 
But I don't know why cause your everything in my life 
And I can't go on without having you by my side 
If we end I now, there's no reason to carry on 
So please don't go, please don't go away
