Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are 
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky 
Seems to me you shine your light 
Down to me to say goodnight 
Twinkle twinkle my old friend 
Sleep is waiting round the bend 
While you travel through the Milky Way 
From afar 
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

Raindrops on a window pane 
Stillness of a summer rain 
Silently the haze drifts through the trees 
Slowly dawn is breaking through 
Yet a morning without you

Curtains rustling in the breeze 
I'm still trapped within my dreams 
Daylight makes its way into my mind 
Coming through 
Yet another morning without you

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Echoes of a voice I knew...

Half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All to soon 
Like an angel passing through my room

Long awaited darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace 
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All too soon 
Like an angel passing through my room
