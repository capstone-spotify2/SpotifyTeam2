Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
But when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No man enemy no man she dated has ever recovered
How is that nobody even knows her name yet
She said are you a fan of theatrical plays
As you proceeded to put her mask on cause she loves a good masquerade
Rum rumors has it that she almost like a phantom
Vanished and then afterwards she on to next one
This is emergency woot woot wishes by god
Struck down with a swift blow to the heart with his expelliarmus
I wish one for you and your guess is as good as mine
That nervous sense in my stomach pretty sure they were no butterflies
They are more like tiny parasite become a story of us
If that doesnât spell trouble I donât know what does

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(If that doesnât spell trouble I donât know what does)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(If that doesnât spell trouble I donât know what does)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
