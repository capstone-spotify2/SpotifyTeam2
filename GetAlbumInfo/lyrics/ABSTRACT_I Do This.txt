I do this for my father
Who've I've only seen
From time to time in my dreams
I do this for, you
I do this for my mother
Who's finally clean
And no longer a feen
I do this for, you
I do this for my sister
My wife and my kids
Cause they part of the team
I do this for
All the naysayers and haters
Who made me one of the greatest
I know it kills you inside
That's why I do this for you

<i>[Verse 1: Abstract]</i>
I do this for the kids who sit a bit outside the mix
Who maybe cope through humor, just to fit in for a bit
Who never let the world know when depressions setting in
To all of those who know you that impression don't exist
And it ain't counterfeit, it's just a way to counter it
I'm living things I dreamed about, I still encounter it
It ain't something that a cigarette or alcohol can fix
But all because of it I flipped it quick, went on to write some hits
This a success off another breath
This the first step in searching to be nothing less
Than be the best in what you do, to prove there's strength in being you
Learned so much in chasing dreams that I never would in school
Depends on where your passion lie, just know passion never lie
Life presents distractions, but your actions have to fortify
The things that you believe in have to scream it like a battlecry
And leave the ones who didn't lookin' stupid while they're asking why
Couldn't lie, I really do this for the ones I love
Those who treat the music as a vice and lyrics like a drug
Those who need advice on how to lift their spirit high enough
To break out of the box they make of lives they know aren't good enough
Just because it's how it is don't mean it's how it has to be
This is what the uninspired testifiers fail to see
Jealousy results from being that which others failed to be
And if it means you're not with me that honestly sounds fair to me

<i>[Verse 2: Abstract]</i>
Do this for my mother, she'll be working for the summer
Do this for my father cause these days I often wonder
What my life would have been like if I was not adopted
To grow up in a home where I was treated like a problem
I don't know, it's just a guess, your guess probably good as mine
Lucky that I grew up in a home that wanted me to shine
Lucky that I grew up round some mountain we were taught to climb
Without that inspiration I don't think that this would be my life
Do this for my friends who've scattered all cross the country now
I'm out in Sweden walking back through life so I can write it down
Make a living off the sound, so crazy to say out loud
I'm the biggest thing since Travis Rice to come up out the town
Sorry gotta stunt a little, used to have my dreams belittled
But it's all a part of it, I know people's minds are fickle
Lines between reality and dreams I blur like faded nights
Come up been so good for me, I wish that I could make it twice
