The way, the way, the way you make me feel boy

Ooh oh, the way I feel when you touch me
Ooh oh, no other like you can love me
Ooh oh, the way I feel when we kiss
Ooh oh, you got me feelin' love mist

It feels like sing-a-ling-ling boy
When I think about us
It feels like ting-a-ling-ling boy
Feel the mist of our love
Feels like ting-a-ling-ling boy
When I think about us
It feels like ting-a-ling-ling boy
Feel the mist of our love

Can I get this feeling now
Found no other in this world
Bet it we can take it slow
And forever be in love

Ooh oh, the way I feel when you touch me
Ooh oh, no other like you can love me
Ooh oh, the way I feel when we kiss
Ooh oh, you got me feelin' love mist
Ooh oh, the way I feel when you touch me
Ooh oh, you got me feelin' love mist

My arms need your love
No one else's touch
When I'm all alone
Feels like my heart's crushed
The feeling is right
My days you'll make bright
Together we rise
Need your lovin' tonight

Can I get this feeling now
Found no other in this world
Bet it we can take it slow
And forever be in love

Ooh oh, the way I feel when you touch me
Ooh oh, no other like you can love me
Ooh oh, the way I feel when we kiss
Ooh oh, you got me feelin' love mist
