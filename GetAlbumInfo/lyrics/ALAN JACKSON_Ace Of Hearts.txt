Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And I won a whole lot more than one night of romance

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.

Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.

I'm gonna hold on to
My ace of hearts...
