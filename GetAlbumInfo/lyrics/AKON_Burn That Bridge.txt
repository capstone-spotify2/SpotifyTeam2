Testing 1 2 3, can you hear me
Yeah yeah yeah

Your daddy was a real nigga
The real rolling stone of our time
Heâs the reason why you wanna be a killer
Still wondering why he left you behind
Now you a blood or crip so ainât you
Fuck that nigga, this my clip thatâs the motto
Living the life and hoping that you make it bigger
Either you end up in the cage or in the ground

Ohh youâre just like your daddy and your son will be just like you
Ohh youâre living on the edge and you know that you gotta

Burn this bridge down if youâre falling across it
Burn this bridge down like youâre playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge

Your momma used to be a hooker
So many men coming in and out the house
Sheâs the reason why youâre working as a stripper
On your knees picking dollars of the ground
No way youâll rustle for that money ainât attractive
Thatâs little Kim, Lindsay Lohan, Kardashian
You ainât gonna get no surgery on your figure
Theyâll only bring the wrong daddy for your child

Ohh youâre just like your momma and your daughter will be just like you
Ohh youâre living on the edge and you know that you gotta

Burn this bridge down if youâre falling across it
Burn this bridge down like youâre playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge

Let it burn let it burn
Find another way to the other side
Let it burn let it burn
Weâll make it to the top even if we gotta climb
Let it burn let it burn
Our kids are counting on us to still arrive
Let it burn let it burn
Now raise your lighters up I wanna see it light

Burn this bridge down if youâre falling across it
Burn this bridge down like youâre playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge
