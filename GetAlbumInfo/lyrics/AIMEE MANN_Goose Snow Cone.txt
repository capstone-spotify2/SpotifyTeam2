Look into the face of the goose snow cone
Should be shaking it loose but you do it alone
Every look is a truce and it's written in stone

Gotta keep it together when the friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly

Thought I saw at my feet an origami crow
It was only the street hidden under the snow
Always snatching defeat, it's the devil I know

Gotta keep it together when the friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly

Look into the face of the goose snow cone
I could pick up the pace but I couldn't go on
I just wanted a place but I ended up gone

Gotta keep it together when the friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly

Look into the face of the goose snow cone
