Everyone's a genius
Brushing up on irony
But no, no one's free

Everyone's a salesman
Gushing with sincerity
Or so, so it seems

I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back

Everyone's a rockstar
Look how cool and dark you are
Oh, what's become of me now?

We'll bust out the mission
We'll bust the holier than thee
OK Then we'll be free

I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back

Lay me on the table operate on me
Spin me like a record scratch the needle back and forth

I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back
