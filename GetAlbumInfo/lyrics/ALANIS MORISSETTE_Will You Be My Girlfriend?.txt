I didn't know how to ask unawkwardly.
I didn't know how to approach it.
I haven't known how to do this informally
Not cut out for dropping masks

I guess I give, and you give back.
Is that right?
Guess I listen and you feedback
Is that right
I guess I call when I need help
Is that right?
Will You be my girlfriend?

I haven't worn my heart on sleeves and been rewarded
with an open heartedness
I haven't felt I had the right to be supported
with a golden tenderness

I guess I risk and you risk back
is that right?
I guess I share and you share back
Is that right?
Guess I uplift you when you crack
Is that right?
Will You be my girlfriend?

Can I lean on your shoulder? 
Will you join me in some pact?
Will you see me as your sister?
Can we love enough to offer that?

I guess I thought that you would laugh and be daunted
And think me clingy and too much
I thought this much too vulnerable, and you'd not cut 
me slack
And think me intolerable

I guess I fall and you stay intact
Is that right?
I guess you hear me and won't attack me
Is that right?
Guess I reach out and you reach back
Is that right?
Will you be my girlfriend?

Guess I divulge and you wink back
Is that right?
Guess you cry, I pat your back
Is that right?
I guess I text and you text back
Is that right?
Will you be my girlfriend?
Is that right?
Will you be my girlfriend?
