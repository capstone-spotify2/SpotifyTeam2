Come on 
I'm not washed up
And you're not back luck
For anyone

Come on 
Things got dark
But now our story's just begun

If I was all that I could be
Would you then love me
Despite the history
Stupid things, I know the shame

If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home

Come on 
What will it take till you see these are better days
Come on
What will it take for you to find out the hard way

If I was all that I could be
Would you then love me
Despite the history
Stupid things, I know the shame

If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
You might as well come on home
Come home.
Come home.
Come home.

If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
Come home.

Yeah. 
I'm busting at the seams
To tell you everything
And it's scaring me 
Cause nothing's sure
And nothing makes sense anymore
I'm busting at the seams
To tell you everything
And it's scaring me
Cause nothing's sure
and nothing makes sense anymore
