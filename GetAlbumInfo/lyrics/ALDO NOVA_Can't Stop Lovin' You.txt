I didn't have to love you
But I did yes I did
At times your love was all I had
But now that love is just a faded memory
Of all the good times that we've had
I never tried to put any chains on you
I tried to take and give
But you kept saying you had your life to live

So do what you wanna do
And be who you wanna be
Go to the end of the earth
And I'll try to follow you, and I have
Say what you wanna say
And see who you wanna see
I'll always be there if you want my love tomorrow

You said I was a fool
But a fool couldn't understand
Or feel the love that I feel
So don't go puttin' any blame on me
I got no reason to give
'Cause I could understood, but you had your life to live

So do what you wanna do
Be who you wanna be
Go to the end of the earth
And I'll try to follow you
Say what you wanna say
And see who you wanna see
I'll always be there if you want my love tomorrow
And then there'll be no pain, no sorrow

'Cause I could never stop lovin' you
And I don't wanna stop lovin' you
What am I supposed to do, if I've got to stop
And I don't wanna stop lovin' you
'Cause I could never stop lovin' you
There's nothing more that I can do
And I'm never gonna stop

'Cause I could never stop lovin' you
And I don't wanna stop lovin' you
What am I supposed to do, if I've got to stop
And I don't wanna stop lovin' you
'Cause I could never stop lovin' you
There's nothing more that I can do
And I'm never gonna stop

There's nothing more that I can do
And I'm never gonna stop
What am I supposed to do
'Cause I never gonna stop
