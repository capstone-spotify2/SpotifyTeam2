Well, I was sent to a place in North Carolina 
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my suprise 
I could see a little light on the hill 
Well, the fire was glowing and really I was knowing 
I was really hot on the track
But in D.C. they said it couldnt' be 
But I'll be the one to bring 'em back 

'Cause I'm a revenooer man 
Hey, I'm a revenooer man 
I got a badge in my pocket 
And a gun on my hip 
And them moonshiners 
Better never make a slip 
'Cause I'm a revenooer man 
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can

Well, the moon was shining bright 
As I looked down the river 
I noticed on the side of the hill 
I can see a red light that was glowing bright 
I knew it had to be a still 
Well, the people down the road said it wasn't far 
But I better know someone 
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star 
I'll bet my bottom dollar I'll have 'em on the run 

'Cause I'm a revenooer man 
Yeah, I'm a revenooer man 
I got a badge in my pocket 
And a gun on my hip 
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man 
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can 

Well, when I got back the woods were bare 
Must've knew I was on my way 
Well, I heard the branches shatter 
And they started to scatter 
I heard two or three of them say 
It's the revenooer man 
It's revenooer man 
He's got a big 45 and loads to fill 
Dragging and shagging to another hill 
It's the revenooer man 
And he'll get us if he can 

Yeah, I'm the revenooer man 
And I'll get 'em if I can...
