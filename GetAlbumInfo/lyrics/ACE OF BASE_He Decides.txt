He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad

If he doesn't love you
You're afraid that you can't go on 
Living without loving
Never makes a person strong, no
If he really loves you
Let him show you that instead 
I will be here with you 
'Cause I know that you're afraid of love

Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad

You'll never change my mind my friend
Don't let that feeling go
This love might change your world around 
In time you'll have to know, oh yeah

Whether you should go 

Oh yeah

Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad

Whether you should be happy
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy

He decides
Whether you

I know that
He decides
