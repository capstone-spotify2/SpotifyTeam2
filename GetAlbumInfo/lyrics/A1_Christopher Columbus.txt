Standing in line, talking âbout nothing
When you walk right by
And I wanna say something but 
Iâm so shy it hurts
You donât see me if I gave you my compass
Then would you be more like Christopher Columbus
And explore my world

Hey now Iâve gotta tell you
No Iâm bursting to tell you
I canât keep it inside

Oh here goes, the truth is Iâm yours
But I may not be necessarily
What youâre looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come knock knock on my door

So the secretâs out Iâve been discovered
Iâm feeling vulnerable my heartâs uncovered
But thereâs no reply
Iâll still be here
Iâll still be waiting
Iâll keep a look out until your ship comes sailing in
Will you ever be mine

Hey now how can I show you
Iâm bursting to tell you
I canât keep it inside

Oh here goes, the truth is Iâm yours
But I may not be necessarily
What youâre looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door

Am I too late
Have you been discovered
I wish Iâd been more like Christopher Columbus
And found you first

Oh here goes, the truth is Iâm yours
But I may not be necessarily
What youâre looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door
