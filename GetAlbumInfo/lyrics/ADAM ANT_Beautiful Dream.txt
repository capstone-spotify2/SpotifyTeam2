She was a kissing my back and my neck and my face I was a 
looking around for the perfect place
To lay down beside her and say baby
This is a time to make babies

Prettiest girl that I've ever seen
I look at you and I think it's a dream
I love your voice and your sexy body
Let's go deep inside into the love stream

Looks like a picture in a gallery
Her legs were long and slim and she walked up to me
Wide at the front and wide at the back
Her hips were curved only her stomach was flat
An IQ of 690
Everything one woman can be

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Push push because I like it like that
Push push and then she pushed back said
Don't stop it's never felt better
I think I'd like to carry on forever

Beautiful dream more than a dream
In fact in love stream, love power
It was a 
Beautiful dream more than a dream
In fact in love stream, love power

Love and hate will never be friends
This is a dream I don't want to end
I'll be your friend I'll be more than your friend
This is a love that I must defend

Slow slow and it grows it grows
Fast fast and it lasts it lasts
On top top til you jump right off
Underneath don't stop don't stop

Now it's time to change position
We gotta make a big decision
Already did this once before
lets get off the bed and onto the floor

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It was (Push) motion, Love devotion 
Sex is emotion, in motion
I think I'd like to carry on forever

This is a dream who's time has come
And you and me are the only ones to
take you down to these special places
Let me touch your mouth let me kiss your face
one and a one and one makes two
Sleeping together like dreamers do

We look to love to make something new
darling darling it's all you 
it's sex that sets your mind and body free
Sex keeps away from the HIV's
open the lock if you got the key 
Sex made you and sex made me
So let's turn it up, let's turn it down
It's better at the second time around

<i>[Chorus]</i>

It was a Beautiful dream more than a dream
In fact in love stream, love power

Fades away
