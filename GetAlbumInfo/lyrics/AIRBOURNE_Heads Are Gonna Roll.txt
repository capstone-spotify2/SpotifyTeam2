Where were you late last night
Heard you were with another guy
Straight up don't tell me no lies
You better have a good alibi
Coz babe if you been naughty
Yeah and you been bad
One day you better look out honey
Coz when I get back baby you know

Heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna take this place to hell all night long
I said heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna get the job done then honey I'll be gone

Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll

I could feel the knives in my back
Twisting and turning making their attack
But now the blades have finally snapped
It's about time I got mine back
So babe if you been naughty
Yeah and you been bad
One day you better look out girl
Coz when I get back baby you know

Heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna take this place to hell all night long
I said heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna get the job done then honey I'll be gone

Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll

I said heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna take this place to hell all night long
I said heads are gonna roll
Yeah I'm gonna get the job done then honey I'll be gone
Yeah heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
Heads are gonna roll
