you know you don't have time to sit around
waiting for the perfect chance to come your way
and you'll never find the answers
to the questions you ask
by listening to what other people say
you've got to let originality be your inspiration
you know plagiarism is a crime (dexter!)
even if it turns out to be a miserable disaster
you will live to try another time - that's why i say

make up your mind and do what you want to do

well you've got to be joking, if you say your thoughts
have fallen into someone else's hands
and you've got to be crazy, if you think your life
is just a mess of threats and tough demands
well you just can't be that far away from what you want
to think that nothing's gonna get you there
'cuz the truth is you were born
with everything you need
no you don't have to be a billionaire
all you have to do is

make up your mind and do what you want to do

if you're gonna do it, do it right!
<i>[solo]</i>

in the end your gonna see that it was worth your time
the results are gonna make you smile
there's really nothing to it, if you use your head
and concentrate for just a little while
all it takes is just a twist of your wild imagination
new ideas will come tumbling out
can you feel the time slipping?
don't keep the world waiting
listen up, if you can hear me shout

make up your mind and do what you want to do
