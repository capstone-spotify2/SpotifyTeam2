Watch out, get outta my way
Did ya hear what I say

Everybody, you don't have to choose it
You don't have to prove it
It's only rock 'n' roll
Mama don' told me, papa don' scold me
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table, don't you snake on me
Mama don' scold me, daddy don' scold me
Told me, show me
You know that he told me

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water

Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street, breathe your last breath on me
Mama don' told me
Poor boy get home
Hot loving, trigger happy feeling
Touching up and teasing
You know it so bad
Mama don' told me, papa don' scold me
Told me, showed me
Rock 'n' rolled me

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Hell, hell, hell, give em hell

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water

Come hell
Come hell
Come hell
