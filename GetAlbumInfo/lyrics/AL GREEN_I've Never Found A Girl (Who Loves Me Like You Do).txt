Ain't no love (baby) like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, shut up in my bones
(I got to say it)
Ain't no lonely days
Ain't no lonely nights
Every thing that she does
You know the girl's alright

(I got to say it)
I ain't never, never found me a girl
(I wouldn't lie about it, baby)
Never, never found me a girl
(To squeeze me tight at night)
Never, never found me a girl
Nobody to love me like you do
(I ain't lying about it, baby)
Love me like you do

(Sweet baby)
Ain't no man got a sweet woman like me
She's everything in the world
One man could claim
She's every poor boy's dream
(Let me say that)
She's every very rich man's prayer
I don't need no money, honey
Because (you know) she's always there

Never, never found me a girl
(Somebody to keep me walking in my shoes)
Never, never found me a girl
(She always brings me good news)
Never, never found me a girl
To love me like you do
Love me like you do (baby)

Never, never found me a girl
(And here I stand with tears in my eyes)
Never, never found me a girl
(And I'm caught by total surprise)
Never, never found me a girl
To love me like you do
(Oh, sweet baby)
Love me like you do (baby)

You do
(I ain't never found a girl)
You do
(You squeeze me tight, love me right)
You do
(Got me walking in my shoes)
You do
(Make me feel good)
