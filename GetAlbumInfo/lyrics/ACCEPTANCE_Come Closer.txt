She's waited too long
For someone to call
Head down in the streets
Fantasies, what she'll see

Some things move in the night
You keep holding me tight
She wears clothes made of silk
For a night some would kill
For a night some would kill

Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
The day calls, the night calls
She dreams big, she don't know
(Keep getting closer)
The first time's the last time

Just like the air he's breathing
She gets this funny feeling
Take a moment, take a moment
Make the moment oh so long

Some things move in the night
Just keep holding me tight
Shade the gold, make it real
Dancing souls what you steal
Tell me what would you steal?
(Steal, steal, steal)

Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
The day calls, the night calls
She dreams big, she don't know
(Keep getting closer)
The first time's the last time

Keep getting closer, closer, closer
Keep getting closer, closer, closer

Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
Keep getting closer
The day calls, the night calls
She dreams big, she don't know
(Keep getting closer)
The first time's the last time

The first time's the last time
The first time's the last time
The first time's the last time
