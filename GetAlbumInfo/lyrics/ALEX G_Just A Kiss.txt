Lying here with you so close to me
Itâs hard to fight these feelings
when it feels so hard to breathe
Caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

<i>[Adam Stanton:]</i>
I never open up to anyone
So hard to hold back
when Iâm holding you in my arms

<i>[Both:]</i>
We donât need to rush this
Letâs just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I donât want to mess this thing up
I donât want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one Iâve been waiting for my whole life
So baby Iâm alright with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
(Iâll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find)
Itâs never felt so real
(No itâs never felt so right)

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I donât want to mess this thing up
I donât want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one Iâve been waiting for my whole life
So baby Iâm alright with just a kiss goodnight

No I donât want to say goodnight
I know itâs time to leave but youâll 
Be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I donât want to mess this thing up
I donât want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one Iâve been waiting for my whole life
So baby Iâm alright

Letâs do this right with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
A kiss goodnight
