Storefront, streetcars rattle
One more losing battle
What is Columbus Avenue to you now?

Last call tattoo parlor
Deathbed sword swallower
What is Columbus Avenue to you now?

The place where you failed
To make your story go over
The place where you bailed
And let the bottom drag you under
Drag you under

Cheap shot paranoia
Exiled from Victoria
What is Columbus Avenue to you now?

The place where you failed
To make your story go over
The place where you bailed
And let the bottom drag you under
Drag you under

Where you moved with a ghastly precision
To the echoes of bones in the air
Finding hope in an X-ray division
Of a world that's not there

Cafe sinners bother you
Empty pockets follow you
What is Columbus Avenue to you now?

The place where you failed
To make your story go over
The place where you bailed
And let the bottom drag you under
Drag you under

What is Columbus Avenue to you now?
