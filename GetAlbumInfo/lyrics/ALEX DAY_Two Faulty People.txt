We are two faulty people 
We break and we bend
If we haven't shattered
We might make amends
For our sharp edges
And rough ends 
And we'll find our home

We are not like the people
That you'd like to meet
We've been re-conditioned
With no guarantee
Now we're second-hand
But we wear it proudly 
On these old bones

When we were brand new
We planned our adventures
To whatever we wanted to be
Then I will swept up
And left us in trenches
Still we have each other 
For company

We are two faulty people
We break and we bend
If we haven't shattered 
We might make amends
For our sharp edges 
And rough ends
And we'll find our home
And we will find our home
