Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze

Wanna improvise with you
Put the world to rights with you
Let me put your mind at ease

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
Out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...

Come and raise a glas with me
Reminisce and laugh with me
Go for broke and paint with me

Come on roll the dice with me
Flip the bird to life with me
We can turn this all around

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there

Doo doo doo doo doo...

All I'm saying is
Climb the wall you've been facing
Catch the wave you've been chasing
We've got something to live for now

Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze

<i>[Chorus]</i>
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there

Doo doo doo doo doo...
