<i>[Alan]</i>
If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end

<i>[Lee Ann]</i>
And if my broken-hearted love dont find a way to mend
I'll go on loving you 'till the end

<i>[Alan]</i>
The years and miles may separate you from me

<i>[Lee Ann]</i>
The pain may lessen more as time goes by

<i>[Alan]</i>
But as for me your memories will never fade

<i>[Both]</i>
And I'll go on loving you 'till the end

If we're ever free to love again I know

<i>[Lee Ann]</i>
Straight back to your waiting arms is where I'll go

<i>[Both]</i>
And I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end

<i>[Lee Ann]</i>
And I'll go on loving you

<i>[Alan]</i>
'Till the end
