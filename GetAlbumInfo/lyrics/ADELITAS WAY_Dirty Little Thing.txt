I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you look at me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no

It's late at night she's at my window
(I'm a fool)
She's drunk again and wants to take it out on me
(You know you do)
She never says goodbye
but what we did plays in my mind
All over you

I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You show me things that I've never seen
My dirty little thing

The sun is up she's out my window
(now you're gone)
The sky will fall and I know she'll be back again
(I know you will)
She takes control of me
and always gives me what I need
Again and again

I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You show me things that I've never seen
My dirty little thing

Tie me up and take control
I know you like what's going on
I wanna see how far you'll go
I like when you strip me down
You wear me out
You take me to another place like no one else

I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You show me things I've never seen
My dirty little thing
Dirty Little Thing
