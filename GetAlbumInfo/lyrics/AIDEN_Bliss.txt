I saw the truth, mom's a whore.
I saw the mark as she passed through the door.
I saw the truth, you're a whore.
Distill the scene and don't lie to me no more.

So what's killing you?
Is it the demon inside?
Look out you're turning blue..
A suffocating lie.

You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.

To wake up she fucks the pain. (Wipe those tears away.)
She wears make-up to hide the shame. (Wipe those tears away.)
Her sanity rides low and self esteem won't grow.
Tonight she'll miss and all she knows, and all she knows, all she knows is bliss.

So what's killing you?
Is it the demon inside?
Look out you're turning blue..
A suffocating lie.

You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.

Her black eyes filled with the love she wrote:
"I'm not insane, I'm sorry I have to go."
These walls are painted red, she put a bullet in her head.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye is all she said.

So what's killing you?
Is it the demon inside?
Look out you're turning blue..
A suffocating lie.

You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
You're all I've got.
