You got me feeling, feeling like this all the time
You got me hanging, hanging onto every line
And I can't take another minute
Take, take another minute
Maybe I should give in
Or should I just keep living?

Too late, too late, it's now or never, never
We'll slip away, we'll chase the day, day

You got me paralyzed
The way that you move, the look in your eyes
Don't say goodbye
The way that you move, move into the night
I'm paralyzed
If I ever hear you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You got me breathing, breathing heavy all the time
You got me thinking, thinking I can be out of line
And I can't take another minute
Take, take another minute
Maybe I should give in
Or should I just keep living?

Too late, too late, it's now or never, never
We'll slip away before we're safe

You got me paralyzed
The way that you move, the look in your eyes
Don't say goodbye
The way that you move, move into the night
I'm paralyzed
If I ever hear you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm not the type to look back
I'm not the type to look back
You mesmerize me too, if you beg me to
I think I could do that for you

Now or never, never
Now or never, never

You got me paralyzed
The way that you move, the look in your eyes
Don't say goodbye
The way that you move, move into the night
I'm paralyzed
If I ever hear you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
