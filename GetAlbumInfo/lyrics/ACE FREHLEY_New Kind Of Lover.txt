She's made of shadows
That live in the night
Ooohh I dream of things
No one would dare
Last night she came to me for a second time
Through the walls, suspended in the air!

(She's) a new kind of lover
She loves like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
(She's) a new kind of lover
She makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that shes a ghost

She knows my secrets
When we're alone
She plays them out
While I'm asleep
Last night she woke up up with a touch so cold
Can it be, she's playin' me for keeps

(She's) a new kind of lover
She loves like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
(She's) a new kind of lover
She makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that shes a ghost

I don't wanna know
Please don't let me know

(She's) a new kind of lover
She loves like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
(She's) a new kind of lover
She makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that shes a ghost
