I done made it up in my mind,
(To) live right, die right
I done made it up in my mind
Serve God 'till I die

I done made it up in my mind,
(To) live right, die right
I done made it up in my mind
Serve God 'till I die

Well if you go down to yonder for,
To search among the sheep
You'll find him there, so I've been told,
The one they love to keep
But consecrated cross I bare,
The du-ty set me free
And then go home my pride to wear,
But there's a God for me

Oh I done made it up in my mind,
(To) live right, die right
I done made it up in my mind
Serve God 'till I die

I done made it up in my mind,
(To) live right, die right
I done made it up in my mind
Serve God 'till I die

I done made it up in my mind,
(To) live right, die right
I done made it up in my mind
Serve God 'till I die
