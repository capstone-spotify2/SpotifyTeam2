Just Chaos!

Maybe he like to brag
Did he invent himself
He live 'till the end of time

Oh Munchhausen was a sun of a gun
He had his share of wild adventures
He rode the cannonball like no other man
And pulled himself up in the air

Just Chaos!

Whether he liked to brag
He lives 'till the end of time
With his immortal lies

Oh Munchhausen took a trip to the moon
And beat the sultan and his navy
With a company containing just five
He gunned them down just by himself

Such a special baron man Munchhausen
He spread chaos around the world

Just Chaos!

Maybe he liked...
