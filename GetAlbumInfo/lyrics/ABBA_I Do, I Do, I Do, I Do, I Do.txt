Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? 
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cos it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cos it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? 
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
