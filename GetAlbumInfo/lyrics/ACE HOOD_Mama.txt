Mama, can you hear me?
Mama
Mama, can you hear me?
Mama, can you hear me?
Oh oh oh
Mama, can you hear me?

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
May eleven special, I was born in God's favor
Mama gave birth in tears through that hard labour
I just wanna thank you, ain't no way I could repay you
Strongest woman that I know, you've been my motivator
And just know I'll be everything that you said I would
Only focus is hoping that all my family good
A lot of ups and downs, a lot of hard times
A lot of cloudy days, prayin for that sun to shine
I was hard headed, granddaddy diabetic
Lord bless her soul, granny kept a fool ready
Five kids, three jobs, how you ever did it?
Tryna make a livin, hustle got me reminiscin
Daddy chose lust over all us
Tell me what's the type of man who never kept in touch
How do you feel? Mama showed me the real
Can't revover them years, too much emotion to feel
We was covered in bills, mama takin them pills
Got er stressin for days, then why the fuck ain't you here
It's why I love er to death, she was dead when they left
Prayin for me every day, Lord honor my steps
I hope you hear my Lord, if yo mama's around
Gotta cherish the love, gotta savor the smile
Never go for nothing, gotta keep it 100
You are the epitome of a strong black woman,
You hear me?

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Dear mama I just wanna say I love you
And if you left toda I don't know what I'd ever do
Sayin this boy ain't nothing like yo mama
Through the road blocks, fake friends and the drama
Mo grilfriends and a chick named karma
Real eyes realize I could call on er
Any time of day, any time of night
Been there from the start up on this journey called life
Now I'm 24 and grown, tourin doin shows
Thankful for it all, know it's been a bumpy road
As we starin at my Rollie, started reminiscin
Boy my bad ass, used to run from all them woopings
But I understand, made me a better man
You hear me mama told you would never want again
I put my pain on the beat, you fed it all to the streets
I'm a believer in me and I be livin the dream
Oh Lord, black boy bout to get feel
Who'da thought that I'd be countin up a couple mill?
All them TV and them magazines were label deals
Talkin bout the struggle, start to give a nigga chills
God it's the press, people still hate
Wasn't for my mama, don't know where I'd be today
Lord have mercy
Don't know where I'd be today

<i>[Bridge: Betty Wright]</i>
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me? <i>[x2]</i>

When all your friends, all your false friends are gone
You know mama's gonna stay and stay and stay and stay 'cause a mama
Mama, can you hear me?
Yea, that's how we do
That's how we do

Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love
Ain't no love like mama's love
Mama, can you hear me?
Ain't no love like mama's love

When your friends tell you how they gon show up and come
And they know bout it there but got it mama
For your support I know you know about a mama
Oh you can count on mama all day, all night, anyway
Mama
I wanna talk about a mama
You know what I'm talkin about
Mama, can you hear me?
Mama
Mama, can you hear me?
