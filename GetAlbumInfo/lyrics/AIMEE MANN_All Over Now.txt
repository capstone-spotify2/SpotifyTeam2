Though I let you steer
You, a cavalier
Inch became a light year
It was pathetic

Well, you can write the play
At every word I say
But I don't have to stay
To see the credits

'Cause it's all over now (All over now)
Yes, it's all over now (All over now)
And I'm free

I was one of few
Who'd stick up for you
And so you never knew
You were a punch line

I could not convince or trust you
To pick up on my hints, must you
Leave your fingerprints
On everything I call mine?

Well, that's all over now (All over now)
Yes, it's all over now (All over now)
And I'm free
Yes, I'm free

From your interference
Which had the appearance
Of making it clear that
It's got nothing to do with me

It's got nothing to do with me

(It's got nothing)
It's got nothing to do with me

It's got nothing to do with me

And I warn you now
The velocity I'm gathering
