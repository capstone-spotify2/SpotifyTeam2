Honey roll over and lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed, and make you rock
Run it up the flag, send it on home
Push you to the wall, and make you moan

She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
She turn it on, upside down
She turn me on, inside out
She turn it on, all around
She turn me on, she turn it on

Baby bend over, touch your toes
She take over, the bomb explodes
A rockin' rollercoaster, flyin' off the top
Take you high diving, off the long drop

She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine

<i>[Chorus]</i>
