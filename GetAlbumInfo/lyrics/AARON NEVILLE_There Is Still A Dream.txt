When will we open our eyes
And finally discover
We are united by one blood? 
When will we realise
We're sisters and brothers
And what the world
Needs now is love? 
There's a dreamer inside
Each one of us
Who wants to believe

There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream (oh)

(aah)
A brother down on his luck
Fallen to chances
We could pick the brother up
A sister down on her knees
Prayin' for answers
Why don't you show
The sister love? 

All over the world
Life is unjust
But I do believe

There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope

After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream

And everyone needs one
'cause no one is freed from
The worries of life
That drag us down
If you can't make it
My hands can take it
We'll stand
Together and pray

There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(to show the world)

There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(whoa-oh)
(to show the world)
There is still a dream
(there's still a dream)
There is still a dream (oh)
