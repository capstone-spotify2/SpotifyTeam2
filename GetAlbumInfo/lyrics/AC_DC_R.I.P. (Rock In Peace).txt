Leave me alone
Like a dog with a bone
Like a stone that's been thrown
Let me be on my own

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Outta my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

(Feels good, for my mama, just like I knew it would)

I get my kicks
Outta playin' my licks
Outta layin' my chicks
Down on Route 66

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Rock, rock, rock in peace

Outta my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Rock, rock, rock in peace

Like Little Richard
Oh Jerry Lee
Chuck baby
I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace
