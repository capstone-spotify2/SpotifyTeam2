Whoo
Lovin' your smile
Lovin' your style
Don't you get it?
Got what I need
You gotta believe
I'm already yours
Let your heart do all the talking (hoo!)
Give it a shot
Give what ya got
Take me flyin'
Give me your lips
Give me the kiss
I've been dyin' for
Let your heart do all the talking

Take my hand
Understand 
That dreams can come true

<i>[Chorus]</i>
And all you gotta do
Is to go, is to flow
With the motion, you
Gotta know, gotta show,
Your devotion
I just wanna be close to you
(in the sunshine)
Wherever the sun shines
(in the rain)
Wherever you go
Let your heart do all the talking

You're makin' a mistake
You're makin' me shake
With desire
Don't need a break
Don't wanna wait
'Til the fires gone
Let your heart do all the talking
Get in the game
Get in the zone
Get in the action
There's really no shame in letting  me know that I'm the one (yeah)
Let your heart do all the talking

Take my hand
Understand
That dreams can come true

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Let your heart do all the talking <i>[x2]</i>

Now finish what you've started
Because you brought it
There ain't no better time
Don't be so chicken-hearted
If you want it
Lay it on the line

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
