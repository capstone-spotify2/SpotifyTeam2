I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you
I hope you're ready for me
I got an axe handle pistol on a graveyard frame
That shoot tombstone bullets... wearin' balls and chain
I'm drinkin' TNT... I'm smokin' dynamite
I hope some screwball start a fight
'Cause I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
I'm ready for you... I hope you're ready for me

All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little hair
I know you feels like I ain't nowhere
But stop what your doin' baby come overhere
I'll prove to you baby... that I ain't no square
Because I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you... I hope you're ready for me

I been drinkin' gin like never before
I feel so good... I want you to know
One more drink... I wish you would
I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good
'Cause I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you... I hope you're ready for me
