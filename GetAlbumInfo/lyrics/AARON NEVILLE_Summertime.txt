Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin', I know they are jumpin' and the cotton is so high
Your Daddy's rich and your Mama is good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
No need to cryin'

One of these mornings
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You will spread your wings
Spread your wings

Then you'll take to the sky
But till that morning
There is nothin' gonna harm you
With your Daddy and your Mama keep on standin' by
They're standin' by

But till that morning
Until that morning
There is nothin' gonna harm you
With your Daddy and your Mama keep on standin' by
With your Daddy and your Mama keep on standin' by
Summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime
