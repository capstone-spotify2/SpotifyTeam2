It happens everytime I think about the reasons why I sittin here alone at night at night and not with you
The heartache takes control and lets me know just what a fool I was and how you cant erase the things you do
And sorry just cant mend the broken heart Ive handed you, break apart is what most broken hearts tell you to do

But Im a long, long way from over you, dont think Ive ever seen so many shades of blue
They say that time will heal, dont know if I ever will cause Im a long, long way from over you

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>

Now over you just sounds like some lost city, people tell me how to find but somehow I just never do

And maybe its because I never wanted to at all of course now I see that I had the best in you
That clock just runs in circles, the days just go on by, the memories hold me closer no matter how I cry

Im still a long, long way from over you, dont think Ive ever seen so many shades of blue
They say that time will heal, dont know if I ever will cause Im a long, long way from over you

<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i>
