I saw you burn down every bridge. Turn your back on everything, leave all illusions behind. Leave the chains of childhood in the past. Destroying the ideas the imprison the mind. Burning Bridges never to indulge in self-deceit again. Who's kidding who when you're lying to yourself? Having fun burning bridges never to look back on the past that made you what you are. 

Keep your protest in your songs. Never voicing any real disgust, just charming antics of anger. The feeling's lost inside your vain big-headed dreams of grandeur. You're still stuck on trying to save the world. Politics without rhetoric, seeing clearly for just one moment, forgetting about the consequence. Burning Bridges never to indulge in self-deceit again. Who's kidding who when you're lying to yourself? Having fun burning bridges never to look back on the past that made you what you are.
