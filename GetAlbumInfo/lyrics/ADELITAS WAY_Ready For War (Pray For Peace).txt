You live your life recklessly
It's hard to hide jealousy
You talk a mile a minute
You take the truth and spin it
You took it to the limit (don't blame me)
Survival of the fittest
You cut my fuse and lit it
And I'm a psycho menace (don't blame me)
I don't wanna have to do this again

I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for change 'cause I've been here before
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war

My heart and soul is tempting me (To waste your place in history)
You start to fall bend and break, (Your weak disease is your misery)
You talk a mile a minute
You take the truth and spin it
You took it to the limit (don't blame me)
Survival of the fittest
You cut my fuse and lit it
And I'm a psycho menace (don't blame me)
I don't wanna have to do this again

I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for change 'cause I've been here before
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war

I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for change 'cause I've been here before
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
I pray for peace but I'm ready for war
