She makes the place a jumpin'
The way she moves around
She like a rump and rollin'
That's when she get it out
And when she start a rockin'
She bring me to the boil
She like to give it out some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

A picture clear for watchin'
The dish is runnin' hot
The box is set for pumpin'
She gonna take the lot
The way she get the butt in
She's gettin' set to ball
I like to chew it up some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

Can't get nothin' on the dial
The frigin' thing gone wild
All I get's the dumbed down news
New satellite blues

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
I got the satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

This thing's nothing but a load of crap
I'm gonna send it right back
You can stick it where it hurts...
Mac!
I got the satellite blues
