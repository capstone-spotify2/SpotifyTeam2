I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish this road would take me home where I belong
'Cause I have found no other place where I will stay
I'm tired and all my dreams have failed along the way

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
Though I wonder what my folks would think about me now 
I guess I've changed, like people do, when things go wrong
But in the end, somehow I know, we'll get along

Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
And all my friends, will they be there, when I come home
How I regret the day when I set out to roam

Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
