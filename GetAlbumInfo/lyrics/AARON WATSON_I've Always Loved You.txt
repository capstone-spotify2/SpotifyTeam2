I don't know how to explain it
But I know the words will hardly do
Miracles, signs, and wonders aren't enough for me to prove to you

But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will

Greater love has not a man than the one who gives his life to prove
That he would do anything
And that's what I'm gonna do for you

But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will

But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you...

Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will
