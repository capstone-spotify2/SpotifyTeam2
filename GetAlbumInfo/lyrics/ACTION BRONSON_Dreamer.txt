Ayo, my headbands filled with acid, out of body
Mind trick, mind sick like Magic Johnson's dick
You know your shorty lettin' Bronson hit
Stuff penis down the neck like it's lozenges
Two bags of drug sleep, 'bout to wake 'em up, though
Stay sharp, cut quarts with the cutthroats
Don't snort, use gloves when you cut dope
Won't stop, eat box on a plush boat
The brougham, forest green with peanut butter
Jelly belly, fuckin' in a smelly telly
African room, drugs up in the nightstand
Look in my eyes, "Daddy, make the light dance!"
Nice pants, cut off at the knee
Cuttlefish, cut up on the beach, out the sea
Mix it with the lime juice, smidgen of it's own ink
(Ah, the beat cut out)
