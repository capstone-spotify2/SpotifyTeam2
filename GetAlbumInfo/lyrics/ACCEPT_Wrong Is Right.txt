Do you believe, wrong is right
When you turn the world upside down
Don't pretend if you love
To be a mad-man on the run

I'm gonna suck - I'm gonna rock till I die
Why don't you join me to cut all the lines

Wrong is right - wrong is right
I'll never believe all the crap they say
Wrong is right - wrong is right
Who can tell what it's like to be insane

The power's on, we're dressed to kill
We're a gang acting wild
We don't care about the time
Monday morning we're back on earth

And I'm trying to be gorgeous again
Just my headache reminds me, what I've done

Wrong is right - wrong is right
There's time enough to regret
Wrong is right - wrong is right
Sometimes I've got to leave my usual way

Wrong is right - wrong is right
Don't give up to change your mind
Wrong is right - wrong is right
Do never do what you don't like

Wrong is - wrong is right - wrong is right
I'll never believe all the crap, all the crap they say
Wrong is right, wrong is right, wrong is - wrong is ...
