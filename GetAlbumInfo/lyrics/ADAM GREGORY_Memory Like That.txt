There are moments in your life 
That are frozen in your mind 
That will change the heart of how you feel forever
And I remember the rain 
The sky was black 
You were tryin' to fix a flat I knew I'd never be the same 
The second I pulled over 
It was me It was you 
The world fell away from where we stood
And the ground around us moved 
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed 
And only love can make a memory like that, a memory like that 
The very first time that we kissed I felt your fingers on my skin
As they wrote the worlds I love you baby 
There are reasons for the rain I can still see yesterday
All I have to do is close my eyes 
To picture our first memory 
It was me
It was you
The world fell away from where we stood 
And the ground around us moved 
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed 
And only love can make a memory like that, a memory like that 
Right here, right now
We're making new memories 
Of you and me, yeah 
It was me 
It was you 
The world fell away from where we stood
And the ground around us moved
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed 
And only love can make a memory like that 
A memory like that
Only love can make a memory like that 
A memory like that...
