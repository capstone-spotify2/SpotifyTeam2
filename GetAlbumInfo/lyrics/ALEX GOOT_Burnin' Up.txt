I'm hot
You're cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on my toes

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burning up, burning up
For you baby
Come on girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself
Back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself, I gotta catch my breath

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burning up, burning up
For you baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
You're staring at me
Oh I can feel it too

<i>[Chorus x3:]</i>
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burning up, burning up
For you baby
