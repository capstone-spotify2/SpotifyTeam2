In the heat of the night
You've pushed my juice to the limit

You slide so right
I know that you'ra going down

It's getting harder to breathe
You burn my bones with your fever

(I'm gonna get ya) - while you sleep
(I'm gonna wreck ya)- release your body heat
(I'm gonna get ya) - I know you're gonna come with me

I wanna be your - Hard Attack - Hard Attack
You gonna feel my Hard Attack - Hard Arrack

When you shiver and shake
I'm a man hell bent on a mission

We're doing it good
I'm a tiger on heat tonight
(I'm gonna get ya) - while you steep
(I'm gonna wreck ya)- release your body heat
(I'm gonna get ya) - I know you're gonna come with me
