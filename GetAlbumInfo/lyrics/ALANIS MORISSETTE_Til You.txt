Iâve been wasting time
Clawing my way to you
Taking no prisoners with my romantic crimes
Iâve been holding on imagining glimpses of you
Holding my breath while you come down the pike

Spinning my wheels around
Iâm here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
While I'm dodging bullets til you

Iâve been taking notes
Nursing the thought of you
Research and deliver 'cause Iâm biding my time
Iâve been holding on this magnet that calls to you
Entertaining myself with these consolation prizes

Spinning my wheels around
Iâm here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
While I'm dodging bullets til you

Theyâve been plenty fond
But mere placeholders for you
They fill this dance card
As you form in my mind

Spinning my wheels around
Iâm here, dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground
Iâm here, dodging bullets til you

Til you
