When it gets dark we're falling far tonight 
Under the moonlight chasing fireflies 
If I'd ask you, "do you think you want to?" 
Just say yes without feeling like you got to 
It's the way that you looked at me 
That night 

When the butterflies 
They came to life 
By your side 

So won't you pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 
Boy don't make me wait forever 
Oh-oh 
You know we'd be so much better 
If we could fall in love together 
Pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 

You lift me up take my feet off the ground 
With just one look it's like you've got me now 
Left me speechless, didn't know I'd feel this 
Just say yes, boy you know that we could do this 
I'm the one you've been dreaming of 
And that's why 

The butterflies 
They come to life 
Every time 

So won't you pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 
Boy don't make me wait forever 
Oh-oh 
You know we'd be so much better 
If we could fall in love together 
Pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 

It's in the sound of your voice 
You've got me caught up in your eyes 
And under all the stars 
Can you feel the butterflies? 
And even at the summer's end 
You left with all your promises 
I still remember when you said 
We could make it last 

So won't you pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 
Boy don't make me wait forever 
Oh-oh 
You know we'd be so much better 
If we could fall in love together 
Pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 

So won't you pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after 
Boy don't make me wait forever 
Oh-oh 
You know we'd be so much better 
If we could fall in love together 
Pull me closer, kiss me faster 
Take me to your happily ever after
