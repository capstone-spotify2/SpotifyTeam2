Out I started, late tonight
Blinded by the light
Strangest feelin' I have know
Don't know what's wrong or right

See the people, clubs and bars
Streetlife passin' by yeah
Screamin' engine, burnin' gas
I'm on overdrive

Danger, danger, save your soul
The finger's writin' on the wall
Where you are the angels are blind

Midnight, and I cruise along the highway
Midnight, and I'm all right on the highway

Midnight sky is bright and clear
New moon on the right
All at once, risin' haze
The freeway is my life

I'm on a high, spacin' out
Where I'm goin' I don't care
Can't you see, this is me
An indestructable boy

Danger, danger, save your soul
The finger's writin' on the wall
Where you are the angels are blind

Midnight, and I cruise along the highway
Midnight, and I'm all right on the highway
I'm all right

Midnight, and I cruise along the highway
Midnight, and I'm all right on the highway
Midnight, and I cruise along the highway
Midnight, on a never ending highway
