Leave your back door open for me and I
Put your keys in under the door on time
Seems we've been waiting for a long time
My delay surely will be a crime

You know whether we can do anything
I know that you can do everything
You said that we should try many things
Let's make an hour so we can do everything

I can find a way to make you love me more than you do
Caroline
I don't want to waste my time unless I'm loving you
My dear
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline

We had each other for too short a while
You caught my soul with your gentle smile
I can swim in your eyes so deep
Rest my lips upon yours so sweet

You know just how I feel for you
I know that my love is true
I'ma tired, I've been feelin' blue
Just let me do what I want to do

I can find a way to make you love me more than you do
Caroline
I don't want to waste my time unless I'm loving you
My dear
Caroline, Caroline....Caroline

I've tried all I can
There's no getting through
Hope you get all you deserve and some happiness too
I'm sure there's a better man
Somewhere waiting for you
But if he doesn't come along
You know I'll be waiting here for you

I can find a way to make you love me more than you do
Caroline
I don't want to waste my time unless I'm loving you
My dear
Caroline
I can find a way to make you love me more than you do
Caroline
No I don't
I don't wanna waste my time unless I'm loving you
My dear
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, Caroline
No oh Caroline
