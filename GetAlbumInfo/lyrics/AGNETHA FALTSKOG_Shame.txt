It doesn't matter what you say,
I don't believe you anyway,
Talking love is easy when it's new.
Slow down don't move so fast,
This feeling may not last,
I've been wrong before, haven't you?

Don't cry to me, if it's just a fantasy,
Shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to play with a heart that's true.
Shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to do the things you do.
Shame, shame on you.

It doesn't matter what you say,
I can't believe you anyway,
The only thing that counts is what you do.
Think twice before you leave,
This is real, not make believe,
The answer lies with you.

So go with her, if your body's sure,
Shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to play with a heart that's true.
Shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to do the things you do.
Shame, shame on you.

You're wasting my life,
Play with hers,
Someone's gonna lose,
Yes, I know who that is.

Shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to play with a heart that's true.
Oh shame, shame on you,
You should know better than to do the things you do.
Shame, such a shame, such a shame, shame on you,
Shame, such a shame, such a shame, shame on you,
Shame, shame on you....
