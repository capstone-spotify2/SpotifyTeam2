And the money she gave me, wasn't enough to pay the rent,
But before I get some all my money's long been spent,
It's nice to get away from all the noise back home
It's harmless in a way we don't have that far to go.

And in June we're three,
And it's nice, cos I love you, cos I love you, cos I love you.
With the rain came freedom, never was one more word so true
In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you
And I tried, and I tried for you
It's not easy, cos I love you, cos I love you, cos I love you.
All the food that we could buy wasn't enough to keep just one alive.
But we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes.
And I tried, and I tried for you.
I can take it, cos I love you, cos I love you, cos I love you.
It's not easy, cos I love you, cos I love you, that's all.
