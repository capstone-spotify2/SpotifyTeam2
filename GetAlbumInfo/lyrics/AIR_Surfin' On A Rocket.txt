Time for flying rockets 
For silver jets 
For surfing bombs 
Surfing on a rocket 

Don't pray to go 
Please take my hand 
Don't get me down 
Surfing on a rocket 

I'll be back one day 
Just pray for me 
I'm on my way 
Surfing on a rocket 

5 4 3 2 1 0 
No one can stop me to go 
You'll never see me again
