Your heart feels heavy now
The mist keeps rolling down
You never got that lucky break
They owe you, they owe you

Your friends have all left town
Your dreams are starting to drown
And you forgot that easy way
They showed you, they showed you

You are the one to blame
Living in total shame
Like the invisible man
You've got to stop as soon as you can

For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance

When there are things you gotta get out
Open the window and shout
You're gonna make your own luck
And show them, you'll show them

And while it all feels clearer now
You gotta kill that sacred cow
You gotta find the sun
And start growing, and glowing

You are the one to blame
Living in total shame
Like the invisible man
You got to stop as soon as you can

For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance

For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance
