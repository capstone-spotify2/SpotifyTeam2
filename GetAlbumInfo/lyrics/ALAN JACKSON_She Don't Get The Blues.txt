Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke 
Beneath them neon lights
And she don't like those hurtin' songs
'Cause she's already lived 'em
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em

Well she checks her broken heart there at the door
She ain't looking for romance,
She's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool
That gets caught up in her rhythm
'Cause she don't get the blues, she gives 'em

She's been on the losing end of love too many times 
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em

She's been on the losing end of love too many times 
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em

No, she don't get the blues, Lord she gives 'em...
