So try, so try, December you,
Even though it seems so hard to do. (ohh)
So try, so try, December you,
Even though it seems so hard to do. (ohh)

So goodbye, a good luck to all.
Just thinking about the things,
That I just can't sleep away,
Today.
Today,
Time will keep the best secrets;
Not honestly,
Not honest indeed,
Not honest indeed,
So try...

Time will stand still;
Let's vanish off,
And ignite into the atmosphere.
Let's trip to the country,
Where we'll run forever,
Break it down, never.
Run from the city,
Not from your problems.
Run from the country,
Not from your problems.

So try, so try, December you,
Even though it seems so hard to do. (ohh)
So try, so try, December you,
Even though it seems so hard to do. (ohh)

Let's build up movies about our dreams.
A figment of speech,
A figure just won't modernize,
Or stabalize our infinite lives.
Led by infinite fears.
Leading us to believe,
That time is the king.
Own up to your life,
So try.

Time will stand still;
Let's vanish off,
And ignite into the atmosphere.
Let's trip to the country,
Where we'll run forever,
Break it down, never.
Run from the city,
Not from your problems.
Run from the country,
Not from your problems. (oh)

So try... <i>[x3]</i>
So try try...
So try... <i>[x5]</i>
Oooh, Try, oooh, oooh,
I'm so blue yeah, I'm so blue.
