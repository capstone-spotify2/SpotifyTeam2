I can make it better babe
I could wipe your tears away
I can make you better babe
If you let me
I could be that better place
I could be your everyday
I could be your saving grace
If you let me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your heart beat
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your chest breathe
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep

I could be that thing you need
If you just believe in me
It's everything I wanna be, if you let me
Baby let me kiss your face
I promise I won't run away
Say bye bye to all the pain
If you let me

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your heart beat
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your chest breathe
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep

Turn the light off to ya turn the light on
Lay me down till I'm coming on up
You know which way to go so baby don't stop
If you're going down low then take me to the top
Whoa, oho,

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your heart beat
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep
The only thing between us should be the sheets
I wanna feel your chest breathe
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep

I can make you better babe
I could wipe your tears away
