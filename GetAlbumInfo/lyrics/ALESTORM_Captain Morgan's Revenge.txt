Countless years ago while lost in barren seas
There whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny
We took up arms and slain the officers of rank
And with swords drawn made the captain walk the plank

And as he fell down to the depths
He swore a deadly curse
"As sure as hell's my final fate
You'll all soon die, or worse"
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

We returned to port with sorrow in our chests
An evil shadow followed us on every quest
Never to feel joy again was our fate
Only misery and death, fear and burning hate

We broke the law, betrayed the code
Now time is running out
An unforgivable offence
Of that there is no doubt
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

Many years have passed now
Yet the curse still lives on
And now we rot in a black prison cell
Waiting for our true calling in hell
But for the lives we leave behind
Don't shed a tear, don't cry
The only way to break this curse
Is for us all to die
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits
