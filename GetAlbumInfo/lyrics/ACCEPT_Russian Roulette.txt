I know you raped me
And rocked my soul and life
You screwed my brain
And offered me a line

You set my heart on fire
To make me stick like glue
You know I'm coming
Down to the point of fear

You make me eat myself
In scream in pain in vain
To lose the last bit of identity
And forget humanity

That's what you like to do
To treat a man like a pig
And when I'm dead and gone
It's an award I've won

Do you think that pays
Pays for my life
Which I give now when I die

Wargames - killed in action
Wargames - for satisfaction
Shanghai'd - killed in action
Wargames

For you it's so easy
To erase my name
You might have a celebration
For the ones who died

Charity in general
Is tax-deductible as well
Ain't that exciting
Hahaha, when everything's alright

Do you think that pays
Pays for my life - hey hey
Which I give now when I die

Wargames - killed in action
Wargames - for satisfaction
Shanghai'd - killed in action
Wargames

What a lie to say I'm immortal
What a lie to sell me your fame
Where is God when I'm buried
Does he stop this bloody game

What a lie to say I'm immortal
What a lie to sell me your fame
Where is God when I'm buried
Does he stop this bloody game

Wargames - killed in action - wargames

Wargames - killed in action
Wargames - for satisfaction
Shanghai'd - killed in action
Wargames - aaah
Wargames - killed in action
Wargames - for satisfaction
Shanghai'd - killed in action
Wargames
