Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Like don't you know man don't you know it's long gone
Like don't you know man don't you know it's all wrong
She's all gone
And she ain't coming back
When she was needing you you should have been right there for that
Now she headed home
You still all alone
Should had heard the phone sooner she ain't texting back
Didn't have time for that
You can choose and rap
Made that decision didn't listen now you'll live with that
Cause she was there for you
When everything was headed south
Came back and you weren't the man
You used to be all about
Blinded by the lights and your teenage fantasy
We be living for now
You were living for how it bout to be
You were bout to live that rock star life
She could have been your rock star wife
And now you're sitting home all night
All because you didn't grasp what was in your sight

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Are you happy?
No really are you now?
Figured out all the shit
That had you tripping out
Got so ready for the lights
And then you chickened out
So you were all about your dreams
What the hell you talking bout
Didn't move didn't make moves in the place you were
Weren't igniting anything
Waiting for it to occur
Would be nice but you know success is not an open door
Sitting at that opening not sure who you were waiting for
Gotta bust through like you don't know what lies behind it
Cause if you wound up you know that you won't ever find it
Listen to you
I mean you go back and rewind it
Play your own tapes back
Remember why you're fucking grinding
It's to inspire youth
To inspire truth
It's to inspire making a living off of what is you
I mean you're really giving when you're really giving you
So you go go and get it
Don't look back at what you lose

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words

Another night slips away
In other words
I should say other words
You should say other words
