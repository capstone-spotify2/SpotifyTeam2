Callin' all players, Don Juan, Romeo too
Don't you turn away, something I say
Could keep her faithful and true

Used to say, satin, silk and lace
Fascinate a pretty face
Bet you're life she'll stay
I was stunned, struck dumb y'all
Total strangers when she walked away, she told me

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real we make a melody down in my soul

Callin' all players, Don Juan, Romeo too
Please don't turn away, everything I say
Is with affection for you

She's in pain, cause' when you hit and run
Like you're blind, deaf, and dumb, every dreams' undone
Only one way to hold her
Be for real before she walks away

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real I get a tickle down in my soul

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real I get a tickle in the middle

Round and round, they all fall down
It's just a losing game when you break it down
(Let me just break it down)

<i>[Repeat: x2]</i>
It's how you say it, all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real I get a tickle down in my soul
