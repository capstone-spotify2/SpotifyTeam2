If I could leave one thing behind,
Let it touch the hearts of others,
Make a difference in your time.
If I could give what you gave me,
Your beating heart, unselfishly,
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.

And that's a long long time
That's a long long time
What can't be broken
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.
That's what we leave behind.
What can't be broken
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.

If I could leave one thing behind,
Let it hold the quiet promise
Of better days to come.
And I should thank you endlessly
For the way you made me see
It's not the destination,
It's the journey.

And that's a long long way
It's what we live for.
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.
And that's a long long way
It's what we live for.
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.

Do you know that I love you?
Do you know it for sure?
Do you know that I keep you in my heart
Forever more?

And that's a long long time
That's a long long time
What can't be broken
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.
That's a long long way
It's what we live for.
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever, past forever.
It's what we live for.
The kind of love that lasts
Past forever.
Ooh ooh, past forever.
