I've got this Caribbean queen 
Rubbin' in my coconut sunscreen 
You'd think you'd be the last thing on my mind 
I've got a beautiful ocean view 
Ten thousand miles from you 
So why couldn't I leave this broken heart behind 

Oh the sunshine is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise 

Well I keep on tellin' me 
There's other fish in the sea 
But your memory keeps reminding me I'm wrong 
There's a party 'bout every night 
And I should be out doin' it up right 
Instead of watchin' re-runs of Gilligan's Island all alone (all night long) 

Oh the moonlight is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise 

This time next week I'll be headed to Texas On a big jet airplane 
Oh when I get home you know this broken heart is gonna hit me like a hurricane 

Oh the sunshine is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise
