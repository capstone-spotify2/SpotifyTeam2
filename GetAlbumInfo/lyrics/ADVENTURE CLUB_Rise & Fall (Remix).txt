No fear
We are going skyward
We've just begun
Diving, head first
Going higher, straight for the sun
Against the odds, but we go-oh-oh
With the flow, your heart is strong, made of go-o-old

One breath in this moment
We'll stay 'til we're chosen, and through it all
With our eyes wide open
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
With our eyes wide open
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
(with our)
With our eyes wide open
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall

With our eyes wide <i>[x6]</i>
With our eyes wide open

We wear, one crown,
Ruling over, straight from the clouds
Riding 'til dawn, we all wonder
When is the fall
Against the odds, but we go-oh-oh
With the flow, your heart is strong, made of go-o-old

One breath in this moment
We'll stay 'til we're chosen, and through it all
With our eyes wide open
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
With our eyes wide open
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
(with our)
With our eyes wide open
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall

We rise and fall
We rise and fall
We rise and fall

We rise and fall
