You ready?

I'm supersonic, bionic
A lady and a freak if you slip me a g and tonic
I know exactly how you want it
So watch me wear and breaking it down
And putting my flame around it
So now let's get this party started
I guarantee you know
Everybody's done it like I've done it
I know you're thinking it's ironic
Just get me on the track and now we run it

Let me show you moments of ecstasy
Verging, no make believe
Flash lights and fire fantasies
<i>[?]</i> and waterfalls
Countdown, we're taking off
Flying inside a fantasy
Now everybody let me see you just

Stop, now we gonna rock
Tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
I wanna see you stop
Let me see you rock
Now we gonna tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up

You're guessing on it, own it
A <i>[?]</i> lady <i>[?]</i> on the rocket
And if you got it, better flaunt it
Been doing my thing, you wanted the ring
You had it then you lost it
Another level, yeah we on it
Been doing it electronic
It don't need no major on it
And if you see it, want it, grab it, shut it down

Let me show you moments of ecstasy
Verging, no make believe
Flash lights and fire fantasies
<i>[?]</i> and waterfalls
Countdown, we're taking off
Flying inside a fantasy
Now everybody let me see you jus

Stop, now we gonna rock
Tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
I wanna see you stop
Let me see you rock
Now we gonna tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up

<i>[Wretch 32:]</i>
Saying stop, drop and roll, me, Alesha on fire
Every time I say "oh", makes my Z's roll higher
Flyer than a flyer, so the airwaves like us
Always gonna ball, I don't need no striker
Not everyone can claim they know AD
Britain's got talent, they can sell HD
1p A, can get a gold AP
Cause what I wrote on A4 can get my old A3

Stop, now we gonna rock
Tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
I wanna see you stop
Let me see you rock
Now we gonna tip it down, take it up top
Don't stop 'till you get enough
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
We keep it coming 'till the sun comes up
