I remember your taste
You're the life I gave away
Failure wrapped around my neck
You're the ghost that held me back
Now I am letting go
Drowning myself in the frozen waters
I feel the words escaping
They break from my thoughts
and disappear from my mouth
They leave behind a taste
The taste of failure
So familiar it reminds me of you
Don't say you'll save my life
I never asked you for anything
But you wanted more
Drowning in your frozen waters
I was sinking, you were my frailty
Drowning in your frozen waters
Don't you say that you'll save my life
I'm vanishing
I'm giving up on myself
Closing my eyes forever
Throw my body into the spinning and twisting
I bend into something else
A catastrophe
A murderer of my hopes and dreams
This is not my life
When winter ends
my new life begins
Bend and break
In pieces I was for you
You were my frailty
Don't say you'll save my fucking life
