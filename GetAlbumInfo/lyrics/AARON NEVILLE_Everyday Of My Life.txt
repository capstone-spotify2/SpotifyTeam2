One lonely night, has stumbled upon a dream
In my ordinary world, with eyes like an angel
A voice like a song from the heart
You came into my world, you crossed the river of time

You climbed the mountain of hope, yes you did
You brought me all the love that I've been living for
And now I can only ask for one thing more

Just to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day

I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day of my life

Just like the stars shinning down from the heavens
Into my solitary world
Just like the glow that comes when the rain is over
Bringing warmth to the world

You are the dawn of my days, yes you are
You are the lantern that lights my way
You are the love that I cherish in my heart
I prayed to heaven that we never part

I want to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day

I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day

Every day I thank heaven for you
Every night I pray just to

Just to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day

I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day of my life

Have and to hold you
Be with you every day
Love and adore you

Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)

Have and to hold you
