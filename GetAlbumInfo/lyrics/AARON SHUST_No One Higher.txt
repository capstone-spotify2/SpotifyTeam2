Our Father, Creator
You hold our hearts together
There's no one higher than You

Redeemer, Defender
Our great and mighty Savior
There's no one higher than You

You are always with us
Gracious to forgive us
By Your power we've been set free

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one higher than our You

Majestic in wonder

There's no one higher than You

Your beauty, Your splendor
Your glory knows no measure
There's no one higher than You

You are always with us
Gracious to forgive us

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one higher than our You

Let my life forever praise the glory of Your name
There is no one higher than You

There is no one higher
No one greater
No one like our God
There is none more able
Christ our Savior
Great and glorious

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one higher than our You

Let my life forever praise the glory of Your name
There is no one higher than You
