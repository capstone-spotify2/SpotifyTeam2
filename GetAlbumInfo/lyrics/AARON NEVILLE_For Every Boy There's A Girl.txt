For every boy, there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me

I pray at night alone in my sleep
That someday my lover I'll meet
'cause I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
There must be somebody for me, for me

I pray at night that you'll come back to me
I love you with all my heart and soul
Darling, I would never make you cry
I want you to come to my side

For every boy there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me

There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me
