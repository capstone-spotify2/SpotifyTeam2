By looking in his eyes something turned me lose in this hot night
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
I can feel your sex winding up the girl in the red dress
And my brain is gone, what is going on, I'm burning inside
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child - love child
I gotta tell myself that he was born as a love child
And the story of his way should not make me stay in this hot night
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child - love child
Don't know what I am
A woman or a man
Many troubles behind me
I'm doing all I can
But I'm what I am
Leave me alone - don't mistreat me
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child - love child
