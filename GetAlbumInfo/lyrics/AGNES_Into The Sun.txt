We walk the streets, we follow light, I follow you
You take me on, you lead the night, I stick to you
You hear my heart one beat ahead, you draw me in
You take the night one step ahead, you let me in

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are drowning in the bright light
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing 'till the night dies

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are blinded by the big lights
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing in the sunrise

We leave the streets, we fly away too high to reach
We walk alone from here to way, way out of reach
I hear the sound from deep within one beat ahead
We're closing in, I see the edge one step ahead

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are drowning in the bright light
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing 'till the night dies

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are blinded by the big lights
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing in the sunrise

We are starlight, black sky lit up
We are starlight, black sky lit up
We are starlight, black sky lit up
We are starlight, black sky lit up

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are drowning in the bright light
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing 'till the night dies

Out of the fire and into the sun
We are blinded by the big lights
Out of the fire and into the sun
We are dancing in the sunrise
