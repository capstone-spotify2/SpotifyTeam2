I like my steak well done, my taters fried
Football games on monday night
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man

I like my coffee black
Ol' tv shows
My women hot and my beer ice cold
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man

I don't like caviar, sushi bars,
The irs or phony stars
I'm a haggard fan
A meat and potato man

I like my fishin' holes, lightnin' bugs
Flatt 'n' Scruggs, and my woman's love
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man

I like my wrangler jeans, cowboy boots
Cornbread and beans and country roots
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man

I don't like politics, hypocrites
Folks with poodles dressed like kids
I'm a hounddog fan
A meat and potato man,
Yeah, that's what I am
A meat and potato man...
