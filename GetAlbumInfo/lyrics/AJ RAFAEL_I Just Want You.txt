There's something I gotta say to you
But I'm so afraid of what you'll do
Ohhhh

I'll just admit this to you now
That I'm stuck on you like glue somehow

Don't wanna feel so cold inside
I wanna feel the warmth that I feel with you all the time

Surrounding me just like the wind
'Cause you're the one who makes me sing

Help me find myself like how I found you oh
I need you so we can live happily too ohh
I just want you

I wanna go out with you tonight
A picnic with candlelight
I might just hold you tight

Tell me you wanna be my queen
If not it's okay a princess seems just my type I promise I'll be there tonight
I'll keep you warm in winter's white
And in the summer walks on beach sound nice
I want you now to talk with on the phone for hours at a time
Baby I just want you to be mine all mine

I wanna be your valentine your Christmas wish your pickup line
I wanna be the one who knows about your friends and foes and the tv shows you love
Look above the stars spell out your name with an exclamation point at the end of the day you're the one who makes me say
