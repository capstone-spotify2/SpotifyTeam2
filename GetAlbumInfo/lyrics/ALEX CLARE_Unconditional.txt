I don't
No, I don't know enough
I don't know nothing at all
But, I know this good love
Good love
You don't
No, you don't need enough
You don't need nothing at all
But, you need this good love
Good love
Woa, woa, woa

You need love
The sum of mine
Got no time for ache
That's just fine
Life's too short
To be angry
Take it out
Take it out on me

Get to know ya
I wanna play a part
I wanna know every inch of your heart
So let rain
A love supreme
I want the unconditional kind
It's what we all dream of
It's what we all dream of

I don't
No, I don't know enough
I don't know nothing at all
But, I know this good love
Good love
You don't
No, you don't need enough
You don't need nothing at all
But, you need this good love
Good love
Woa, woa, woa

Be it now
If you wanna be
I got something to give
No negativity
Don't know what it is
But, it is something good
And I won't let it lie
Or be misunderstood
There is nothing
Nothing left to say
So, I show my actions
In the deepest way
The riddle of you
So selfless
Never be broken
I feel helpless
Feel helpless

I don't
No, I don't know enough
I don't know nothing at all
But, I know this good love
Good love
You don't
No, you don't need enough
You don't need nothing at all
But, you need this good love
Good love
Woa, woa, woa

I don't
No, I don't know enough
I don't know nothing at all
But, I know this good love
Good love
You don't
No, you don't need enough
You don't need nothing at all
But, you need this good love
Good love
Woa, woa, woa
