they want us to tell them
what to burn into the groove
we're just gonna sit
and let them make the first move
the radio obsession
doesn't mean a thing to me
i don't like first impressions
and i don't watch much tv

i don't want to think about it
who, what, when, or where
i don't want to think about it
i don't really care
i don't want to think about
creating something new
i don't want to think about it
because i've got much better
things to do

i don't want to think about it
i don't want to see
i don't want to know
the kind of fool
they'll make of me
the public gets what they deserve
not what they demand
unless we all decide to be
a business, not a band

i don't want to think about it
who, what, when, or where
i don't want to think about it
i don't really care
i don't want to think about
creating something new
i don't want to think about it
because i've got much better
things to do - just like you

it's just an awful nightmare
and i get these awful headaches
and i can't get any sleep at night
i don't know what to do
i don't know where to turn
or what to think
i haven't got a clue
i don't know what's come over me
i'm getting dizzy
please will someone make it stop
