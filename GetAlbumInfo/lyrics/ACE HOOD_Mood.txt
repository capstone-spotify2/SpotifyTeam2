Haha, shit
Cause I'm in the mood baby
I'm in the mood nigga
Don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
Shit

<i>[Hook:]</i>
I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessin's
Jump out the coupe, where fuck is the roof? Flexin'
I'm with the crew, you ain't makin' moves then exit
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sext
Ooh, ause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood

Brought a car with a horse, got a young nigga whippin'
I just pull up at the light, shittin' on your Honda Civic
I got racks in my pocket, dead fresh catch a body
That potato on a shotty, count that money for a hobby
I just pull up to the villa, big shit, Godzilla
Young nigga, chinchilla, all ice like itâs winter
Hit the mall, blow a check
On the gram, gotta flex
Ain't no love for my ex, oh lord boy you blessed
See I'm in the mood to fuck up your mood, I'm covered in jewels
I just brought a crib with too many rooms, it came with a pool
I know what you're thinking, got rid of my neighbors, had too many rules
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, we never gon' lose
I'm gonna get everything a nigga prayed for
Fuck me and call me daddy ain't that what you came for?
I'm in the mood, I'm like fuck it, put twenty chains on
Go hit the club, pour the bottles to see the light show

I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessin's

I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sext
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood

Middle finger in the air, that's my motherfuckin' mood
Twenty-twenty with the vision, I got panoramic views
In my cup, got the screw
Phantom ghost, peek-a-boo
Nigga sleep, let 'em snooze
Ace Hood got the juice
I'm the motherfuckin; man, twenty bands for a <i>[?]</i>
I just brought a foreign, pay for it like a boss do
Nigga in the mood, keep it cool, goons crazy
Walk in the club with them Haitians
The fragrance amazing
I just might cop me a crib and only live in that bitch
I might just cop me a whip and only drive that new shit
I might just charge every hoe that I encounter for dick
Then pull up on my old teacher who said I won't be shit, bitch

I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessings
Jump out the coupe, the fuck is the roof? Flexing
I'm with the crew, you ain't making moves than exit
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sex it
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
Ooh, cause I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessin's

Cause I'm in the mood baby

Don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
Shit
