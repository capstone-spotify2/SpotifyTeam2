I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)
I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)

Oh, though you said you would
I only wish you could
I know I'm trying to be someone

Say I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You got to ride
(You got to ride)
Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried
I really tired to sleep at night
(Sleep at night)

Before the break of day
Turning another page into life's mystery

And the light of day
I can now hear you say
I then take this trip
With me to eternity

Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You need a friend
(You need a friend)
Oh and as soon as I wake up
The sun begin to shine, I start to rain
(Start to rain)

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
I, I could be with you

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
Now I wanna be with you, oh yeah

I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't wanna ever leave you
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me all alone

I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me away
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't want you to ever leave me all alone
