I'm here
Just walking on a wire
I'm tripping on my words
I'm burning with desire
Cause now there's you
You've given me a name
A story with an ending
That I would never change

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
And if you ever need me
I'll be there for you
And if you stop believing
Just know we'll make it through
And when you're down and broken
Well, I'll be by your side
Cause I know that today
Is the first day of the rest of our lives

So take
All that's left of me
My heart into your hands
Your hands are all I need
And now I'm feeling high
Cause your love is like a drug
You've given all you can
But I cannot get enough

<i>[Chorus]</i>

And I'm giving it all
Yah I'm giving it all to you
Yeah there's nothing that I wouldn't do
So I'm giving it all
Yeah I'm giving it all to you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

So take my hand
I'll lead us on
Through stormy seas
And rivers strong
In all that's dark
Our colors bright
So now I say
To you goodnight..
I say goodnight..
