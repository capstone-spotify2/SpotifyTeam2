Like Maria's love for her Tony I fell
Such a West Side Story scene
You lock me up with your love
Now we're partners in crime
And you crown me to your queen

Listen to your heart and follow me
Oh Oh
Live and let die
Listen to your heart and follow me

You are the one
You're my golden ratio
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio

So they play in my mind
Took a bit out of time
Understand but can't forget
Now I'm drawn to you like the desert to rain
Can't undo and won't "fregret"

Listen to your heart and follow me
Oh Oh
Live and let die
Listen to your heart and follow me

You are the one
You're my golden ratio
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio

I turn like the flowers
Turning to the burning sun
And the giving ground
They don't understand us
They're living in another world
In another time
In another time...

You are the one you are my golden ratio
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before...

You are the one
You're my golden ratio
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio
Ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio
