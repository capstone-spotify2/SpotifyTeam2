I just died in your love, I'm in Heaven
Girl don't wake me up from it
'Cause you is a blessing
Oh baby, yeah you is a blessing
Don't you never forget it,
Said he never treat you right
He be in and out your life
You didn't gave him your heart and soul
I know it's something I can't do
'Cause I hate to see going through
The things you going through
So while we're laying in this dream right here

Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up

Baby, tell me how it feels to you now
I finally got you here
I finally got you here
All the things you need, I give to you now 
I finally got you here
I finally got you here

Man of the year, 
Feeling proud, and you know I'm that nigga tell me what's to fear
Girl, I wanna love you
I wanna love you
Let me do it right, do it right
Look in your eyes
I could feel it when I touch you, oh
Fuck it with them lames
Girl, that's how it go
I never played the part, just to steal your soul
Everything we're doing now you ain't losing, no
I just wanna give you everything and more

You say he never treat you right
He be in and out your life
You done gave him your heart and soul
I know it's something I can't do
'Cause I hate to see going through
The things you going through
So while we're laying in this dream right here

Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up
Never wanna wake up

Baby, tell me how it feels to you now
I finally got you here
I finally got you here
All the things you need, I give to you now
That I finally got you here 
I finally got you here
