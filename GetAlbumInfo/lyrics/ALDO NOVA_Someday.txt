I woke up this morning
And you had gone away
You left a few words in a letter
There wasn't much to say

You wrote
Baby I'm sorry
We sure had some fun
You'll find another
And signed it with love
All of my love

Someday
When you need a friend
Just call my name
You know I'll be there
Someday
I hope you understand
Cause you are my woman
And I am, I am you man

So I heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend
That you're doing fine
You know I always knew that you would baby
But after all this time
Do you still have my picture?
Do you still wear my ring?
Does your heart beat a little faster when you hear my name?

Someday
I'll hold you in my arms
I said I love you I need you
God couldn't tear us apart
Someday
I'm going to shake your hand
Cause you are my woman
And I am, I am you man

Only you can save me
Give me shelter from the storm
So cold and lonely
Cover me, baby cover me
Never let me go

I'm too proud to beg
I'm too tired to cry
I'll do anything to show you baby
What I'm feeling inside
Just look in my eyes

Someday
I hope you understand
You can't change the world
But I'll do what I can
Someday
I'll wipe away your tears
I'll hold you so near baby
Someday
You say that love ain't over till you set it free
Baby come back to me
I'll wrap you in my arms
Someday
I'm going to take you home
Right back where you belong
Here in my arms
Someday
You say that love ain't over till you set it free
Baby come back to me
I'll wrap you in my arms
Someday...
