Half Past Loving You 
I'm getting there yeah
I got a ways to go
But I'm getting there
The memories don't hurt like before
I'm getting there
I'm getting there

It's half past loving you
A quarter 'til I
Find a love that's new
Time will heal the heart
That's broken in two
It's half past loving you
It's half past loving you

I'm getting there yeah
I got some work to do
But I'm getting there
Everyday I'm a little more over you
I'm getting there
I'm getting there

Someday I'm gonna wake up and not be
thinkin' about you baby
Someday
