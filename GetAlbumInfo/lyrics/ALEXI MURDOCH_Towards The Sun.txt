See, the clouds are creeping towards the sun
And I'm slipping away unseen by anyone
The light is turning gray; the day is done

Water is so cold and heavy on my mind
I dreamed of walking with you but I fell behind
Looking for a road I could not find

And now the ice is stirring and spring is near
There is no one calling but the sound is clear
And though I'm not yet gone, I'm still not here
