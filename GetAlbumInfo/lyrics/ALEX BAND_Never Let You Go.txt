I can hear you
Call my name
Sitting beside me
Like a burning flame

My eyes are closed but
I feel you breathe
Whispering softly
Listen to me

I will never, ever, ever
Let you go, you know
I will never, ever, ever
Let you go, you know

Take my hand
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me

I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
On my own two feet again

Something about you
It caught my eye
A romance that
I cannot describe

And I remember
The way you taste
The smell of your skin
The touch of your face

I will never, ever, ever
Let you go, well, you know
I will never, ever, ever
Let you go, well, you know

Take my hand
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me

I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
On my own two feet again

And when you can't go on
And you fear you won't survive
You can turn to me
I'll be here, right by your side

Well, you know
I will never, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

Take my hand
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me

I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
On my own two feet again

And every night
Every dream
With every song
You'll hear me sing

I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
On my own two feet again
