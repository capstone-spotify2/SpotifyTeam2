You steal from the hungry... you take from the poor
You swindle the rich man... and then you steal more
Greed is your life-blood... and white collar crime
Your hands don't get dirty... no, you steal with your mind

But the days of your reign... are all over now
The fortress you built for yourself, has come crashing down

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
No limos, no yachts, no homes
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
Vultures pick at your bones

Welcome to main street... you forgot your champagne
All of your off-shore accounts, have gone down the drain
Your stocks are all worthless, your paper trail burns
Your riches have turned into rags, the tables have turned

An eye for an eye... justice is served
Vengeance is ever so sweet, when you get what you deserve
No, no, no, no!!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
No limo's, no yachts, no homes
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
Vultures pick at your bones
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
Only life in your cell
There is no shelter... (no shelter)

No, you can't take it with you to hell

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
No shelter... (no shelter)
No limo's, no yachts, no homes
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
Vultures pick at your bones
There is no shelter... (no shelter)
Only life in your cell
No shelter... (no shelter)
No, you can't take it with you to hell
