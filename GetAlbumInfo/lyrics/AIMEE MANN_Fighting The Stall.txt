It's all right once you're in the air
Just hope there's altitude and prayer
And if we survive the takeoff
The chances of accident are small
As long as there's some procedure
For fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

So now we're drawing straws to see
Just who will get the duty free
When you're on auto-pilot
And running on fumes and alcohol
The moment of truth deciding
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

And I'll go down in flames just for the hell of it all
Because I couldn't take
Standing in place
Waiting to fall
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

So we'll attempt the landing
And spiral into a fireball
'Cause that was the understanding
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall
