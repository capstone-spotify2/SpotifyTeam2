You tell me of a place you like to go
You say it will reach out and seize the sorrow
And we always mean to act on what we say
So come on, oh darling now... hurry, hurry, let's go

We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling

I told you of a place that I had been
It was dark and I was supremely alone
No matter now if the compass fails again
'Ð¡ause in your love I built a home

We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling

We're all we need
We're all we need
We're all we need
We're all we need

We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling

Most certainly I'm where I'm supposed to be
In a molten sun; with you I am free
Today our hearts won first prize
'Ð¡ause we're wise with the feeling

We're all we need
