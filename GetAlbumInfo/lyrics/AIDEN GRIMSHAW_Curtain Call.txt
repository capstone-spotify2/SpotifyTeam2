Curtain calls, there's no more alcohol
As the rain begins feel it soaking into your bones

Don't let time be wasted
Let your heart dictate this
Take my hand and follow me
Lose control with me tonight

Give me all your love please oh
Give me all your love please, please, hey
Give me all your love please yeah
I said give me all your love please, please

Silent stares
Big leap, I'm unprepared,
But I'm fighting it
Reigniting this once more
Burning bright sensation
There's no medication
But they could recreate
This world we make 'cause it's ours

And you say oh my love
You know I've come to bring you peace

Give me all your love please
Give me all your love
Give me all your love please
Oh and all I need is all your love,
And all I need is all your love,
Is all your love
Is all your love

Oh my love, you know I've come to bring you peace
You'll be saying oh my love
You know I've come to bring you peace

I need your loving all day baby
I need your loving all night
I keep you warm and I hold you tight

I need your loving all night
I need your loving all day
Said only you can hear the words I mean to say

Give me all your love please
Give me all your love
Give me all your love please
Oh and all I need is all your love
And all I need is all your love,
Is all your love
Is all your love

Curtain calls, there's no more alcohol
As the rain begins feel it soaking in
