Well I tried to tell you baby
Running makes no sense
Now you got me baby
Up against this fence
And Ain't that a shame... shame shame
Shame... shame the way you do
Well it's a shame... shame shame
Oh it's a shame on you

Well now you walk out in the evening
Don't even say you're gone
6 o'clock in the morning
You come walking home

And ain't that a shame... shame, shame
Shame, shame the way you do
Oh it's a shame... shame... shame
Hey it's a shame on you

Well I be sittin' there waitin'
Listen everybody
Cryin' for you to come home
Especially you girls
When I wake up baby
Is it right to be left alone
I'm sittin' here all alone
While the one you love is never home

And ain't that a shame... shame... shame
I love too hard... my friends sometimes say
Shame... shame the way you do
But I believe... I believe that a woman should be loved that way
Well it's a shame... shame... shame
But it hurts me so inside to see her treat me so unkind
Oh it's shame on you
Somebody... somewhere tell her it's unfair
