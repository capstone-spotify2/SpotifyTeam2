I'm sorry
I'm a stand- up guy
Fuck y'all

See when you get the wave you can dictate
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Play big bank take lil' bank
Boy been special like a 38
Slick talk never mind anyway
Ima come see you like the rent late
Get a nigga crushed on a Wednesday
Chevy do you dirty check the intake
Snapping on the beats like a photo
Looking for revenge if you don't know

Oh yeah, oh yeah
When you go the wave you can dictate
I don't give a fuck what a bitch say
Oh yeah, oh yea
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Oh yeah, oh yeah
How are you? Juno
Been taking care of business on the low low
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Praying that my dawg get his life right
I love getting head on the turnpike
Foot steady stepping on your windpipe
You can tell it's foreign by the headlights
I got a bad bitch, Puerto Rico
Compare it to the flow that's a kilo
How he get rich he a negro?
Kunta Kinte in a new whip
Cosmetic clips give your facelift
Hit G5 for the day shift
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
I been in the gym and got macho
Swerving on a hater like a pothole
You don't understand these niggas GABOS
I send my niggas through catch a Vato
Niggas want beef bring a milkshake
Better know you fucking with a Jefe

Oh yeah, oh yeah pussy
When you go the wave you can dictate
I don't give a fuck what a bitch say
Oh yeah, oh yea
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Oh yeah, oh yeah
How are you? Juno
Been taking care of business on the low low
Oh yeah, oh yeah
