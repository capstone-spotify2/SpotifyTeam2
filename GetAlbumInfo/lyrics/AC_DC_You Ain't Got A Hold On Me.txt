You can roll me round your finger
You can roll me if I'm blind
You can roll me tally ho ho
I'm the easy rollin' kind
But don't think I'm facin' down hill
'Cause soon you'll see
You'll lose your grip and slip
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you let me be
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You can take me to your bedroom
You can take me to your heart
You can take me to a climax
I won't fall apart
But don't count on me givin' it
All back to you
Just because I'm hooked on livin
Doesn't mean I'm hooked on you

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you let me be, no no
You ain't got a hold on me
Oh let me be

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you just let me be
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me

Hey you ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
