<i>[Intro - Missy Elliott]</i>
I've been around the world (mmmmm)
And I still can't find my baby
See I searched high and low
And I still...still can't find my baby

<i>[Verse 1 - Aaliyah]</i>
(Ashame) It's ashame (shame, shame)
That I've searched the sky, high and low
Still can't find my baby..
Where could he (where could he be at?)
Where, could he be? (where could he be?)
Let me walk the streets
Through snow and sleet
Until I find my baby, baby

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
(Oh) It's a crime (crime, crime)
When you take this poor heart of mine
Use it for a rug to walk on (a rug to walk on)
Then you're gone (gone)
Then right out my life for the last time
I'm gonna find my baby, baby

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi (ay-yi-yi)
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye (he didn't say goodbye)
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die? (until I die-die-die-die)
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Yeah-yeah

<i>[Chorus (repeat 2x)]</i>
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he with another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi

<i>[Outro (Tweet):]</i>
I keep searchin' and searchin'!
