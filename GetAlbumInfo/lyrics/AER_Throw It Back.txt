<i>[Verse 1 â Dave:]</i>
I step in the room, with two brews
Iâm reppin FAM, the next up
No second guessing my plan
Flippin' Oâs for 380 baby
Lately I just pace it
Workinâ on the same shit
Just not in my basement, now Iâm east side chillin in my own crib
We all faced watchinâ goons doing dumb shit
I host the party while girls ainât gettinâ off me
If I donât like the look of your posse, oh
Sag in my jeans, followin dreams, not stoppin
I been over that robotic routine
Make them flip out, head over heels, Iâm built for it
Show me to somebody important, or tell them

<i>[Chorus â Dave:]</i>
Itâs the FAM, letâs get it goinâ
If youâve got a full drink, throw it back, itâs on
I donât plan on gettinâ to know ya, so girl letâs live in the moment
Throw it back! if youâve got a full drink! Throw it back! Throw it back!

<i>[Verse 2 â Carter:]</i>
All black change of clothes in my back pack
You can only see the top of my head from in front of this fat stack
Graffiting the game, painting my way to a million, I tagged that
I can grab the cheese without getting caught in a rat trap, that, that
That angle of you, for that I hate me too
Itâs obvious that I bring the party like a lake thatâs blue or a steak with a chew, 
or a private gate waiting for me to step Through, Iâll catch you, controlling the empire that Iâll get soon

<i>[Chorus â Dave:]</i>
Itâs the FAM, letâs get it goinâ
If youâve got a full drink, throw it back, itâs on
I donât plan on gettinâ to know ya, so girl letâs live in the moment
Throw it back! if youâve got a full drink! Throw it back! Throw it back!
