Iâm in hellâs kitchen with the Lordâs mitten
Runnin tail bishop, Iâm the Mel Gibson
Brave hearted nigga, keepin rap livin
Young legend, Merry Christmas and the flow gifted
Uh, and I mean what I say
Not a game nor a gimmick when you mention my name
Niggas pill poppin and dancing too much in the game
Talkin bout yo fortune and fame, yall soundin the same
We need a change, what happened to that real in the booth?
Letâs take it back Queens Bridge back when Nas was the truth
Iâm talkin Everyday Struggle to Big Poppa and Juice
And to consumers who still assuming this message for you

Death around the corner, nobodyâs gonna miss you
Boy I tried to tell em, they ainât wanna listen
King of the south, who got a problem wit it?
I rebuild a building, make you come and visit
Letâs have a moment of silence
Compare me to a prison of violence
Iâm a murderer, fuckin murderer
I never heard of ya
Kickin down the door, took my chances like a burglar
Word to my mama bout this drama, boy you oughta know
Thereâs a bigger difference 'tween real rap and metaphor
Donât get it twisted, I body them niggas
You know Iâm the realest, you cannot prevent it nigga
Still

I got what they missin, nigga come and get it
How dare you think these niggas really competition
Call the mortuary, make a reservation
Bar for bar I ruin niggasâ reputations
Uh, yea my flow is the illest
And I never had no feelings, I should visit the dentist
Niggas talkin out of term until reality visit
Til somebody bring the comma, thatâs for who made attendance
You niggas finished
Never can fuck with my coalition
You with me or you runnin, lil nigga thatâs yo decision
Screamin fuck em (fuck em)
To you and yo opposition
And hereâs what I think of they listin them names mentioning
PSA bitches
