Missiles rain down on me
I take em all
Gun fire, ceasefire, I still bleed
But I'm not in denial
I surrender every inch of me
Put my hands up for the world to see
Missiles rain down on me
I take em all

I'm all alone in this world
But I'm a peace with my flaws
I don't abide by the law
A rebel with a cause

'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
(A rebel with the cause)
I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)

Call your soldiers off me
I'm breaking out
Be myself and I know war may
So put your weapons down
I surrender every inch of me
Put my heart out for the world to see
So call your soldiers off me
I'm breaking out

I'm all alone in this world
But I'm a peace with my flaws
I don't abide by the law
A rebel with a cause

'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
(A rebel with the cause)
I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
I won't ever given to wars
Now that I'm breaking through
I'm taking back all of me
From you

'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
(A rebel with the cause)
I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
'Cause I'm a renegade! (renegade...)
(A rebel with the cause)
