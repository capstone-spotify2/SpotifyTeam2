Bow down I'm invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

Believe me
You've never met a mother fucker like me
Bet you've never seen the things that I've seen
Bottled up inside this time
Cause I'm taking back my life

I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'll break you a hundred different ways
And I'll make you remember my face
Thought that I would let you leave
It's hard to stop what you can't see

I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible

I will waste you
When you can't escape me now
And I will break you down
(Invincible)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

Invincible
Invincible
Invincible
