Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry

Just last year when I was only seven
Now I'm almost eight, as you can see
You came home a quarter past eleven
And fell down underneath our Christmas tree

Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry

Mama smiled and looked outside the window
She told me son you better go upstairs 
Then you laughed and hollared
"Merry Christmas"
I turned around and saw my Momma's tears

Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry

Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry

No,I don't want to see my Momma cry
