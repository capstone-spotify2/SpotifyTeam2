<i>[Intro]</i>
(It could be a better world)
(If it wasnât for this)
(And wasnât for that)
If it wasnât for this it wouldnât be that
You heard?

Bad bitches, top down
Foreign cars, poppinâ bottles
And niggas broker than my pride
We givinâ niggas what they want
Dirty money weâll be spendinâ
Came from the bottom, now all my niggas winninâ
Pull up in that drop, niggas get offended
Hundred on the watch, Iâm shininâ every minute

<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i>
Yeah â I remember nights on those porches,
Iâm dreaminâ Porsches and Benzes
Drinkinâ Hennessey plottinâ on other ways I could win
Back in the day I was troubled when knickerbockers was in
Mama off in the kitchen cookinâ my favourite again
Had my sights on a million, most my niggas was dealinâ
Stashinâ that work in them Civics, runninâ that board like the inning
Hoppinâ up in that new Chevy, that bitch was too pussy tinted
Heard them jack boys are lurkinâ, bet Iâll be one of the victims
A cold world, a cold world
Tryinâ to make a dollar for my daughter and my olâ girl
Gotta make a way, Iâm chasinâ paper, Maybach chauffeur
If you donât grind then you donât shine, nigga, thatâs word
Eh, thatâs word â I say âhey young world, how you doinâ today?â
âYou ever ran out of answers, all you could do is pray?â
She told me âbaby, youâll recoverâ what my granny would say
Donât got no grudge with my daddy, a millionaire to this day
I taught myself how to be a man, ainât no father to thank
I felt that nigga should be around just to show me the way
Just know he wasnât, I was out here thugginâ,
Lookinâ at them dope boys stuntinâ, fours on them Cutlass,
Pockets full of them hundreds, bitches love it, low-key in buckets
No kind of budget, screaminâ âfuck itâ when you came from nothinâ
Came from nothinâ, wordâ¦
(If it wasnât for this)
(And wasnât for that)

<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i>
Okay I hustle, itâs off the muscle, this shit my religion
Youngin focused, Iâm on it, and I wanted to seize every figure
Had to make our way out the struggle and sacrifice with decisions
Ridinâ low in the Taurus, I always prayed for the Bentley
Had a whole other mission, to get rich on you bitches
Tired of goinâ to the bank and they say my funds insufficient
Only one thing to do, I had to go out and get it
Always wanted to ball, I had to play my position
And I did just that, put on my city in fact
I kept a milâ in my safe, and plus thereâs 12 in the gat
200k for the whip, you see the 30-day tag?
Iâm on a boat with some bitches, I give a fuck if you mad
We livinâ â straight out the gutter to makinâ millions
And I did it with real niggas
(If it wasnât for this)
(And wasnât for that)
