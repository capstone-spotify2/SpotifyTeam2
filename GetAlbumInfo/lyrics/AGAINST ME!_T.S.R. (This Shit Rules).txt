The party's over
A CD skipping
It's the same hook repeating
Grows more grating with each passing second...

And the walls contain a resonation, laughter, and conversation.
It was fun while it lasted, but now we should be going.
I hope everybody had a real, real good time
The hospitality's partaken, my head is flying my heart's racing to keep up. 
And I hope I haven't overdone it nooo... 
I hope my body can take it. I hope I make the occasion.
It's only this fucked up.
I start realizing all this living is just dying 
and if these are my friends, if this is my home,
if this is how i spend my nights, how I communicate, and demonstrate a love of life. 
My eyes roll into the back of my head, if these are the last words that I've ever said
No I'm not ready to die just yet.
