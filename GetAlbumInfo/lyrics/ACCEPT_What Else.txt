Heroes - keep dying
Nations - dividing
Principles - they're gone
It's war

Wallstreet - buy in politics
Jesus - up for sale
Do anything - for money
I'm a whore

What else - what's in it for me
What else
What else - what's in it for me
What else

Deadlines - headlines
Make me - the biggest star
I don't need personality
'cause it's war

I'm greedy - I'm deadly
Don't give a fuck anymore
Anything for money
I'm a whore
