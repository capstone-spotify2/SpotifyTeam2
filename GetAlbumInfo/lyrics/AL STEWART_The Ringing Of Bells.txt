Upon this day, if all else fails
It seems we'll have to face the truth
I believe for my part in this thing
I really did love you.

What you loved was love itself
And trying to make a lie come true
I believe for your part in this thing
You hardly even knew.

All along the city streets
You can hear the voices swell
Like the ringing of bells.

Memories on days like these
They echo like the rain in wells
Like the ringing of bells.

The saturation point's been reached
Can't soak up any more regrets
I believe from the start of this thing
I must have paid some debts.

Looking at you now and then
You seem to be like someone else
I believe at the heart of this thing
You hardly knew yourself.

All along the city streets
You can hear the voices swell
Like the ringing of bells.

Memories on days like these
They echo like the sea in shells
Like the ringing of bells.

All along the city streets
You can hear the voices swell
Like the ringing of bells.

Memories on days like these
Run deeper than time can tell
Like the ringing of bells.
