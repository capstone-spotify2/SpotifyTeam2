Listen, all around the world, the people crying, can't find somethin' to believe
They put so much faith in people who are lying, they're so easy to deceive
Ain't no mystery, you know the words to set you free, there for all the world to see
When you got it on your side, there's no reason left to hide, you got to give it to receive
Yeah the message is love

Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love (oh-oh)

Deep in every heart, there's an answer, what will it take to make it real
Leave and console my wall of confusion, still can't tell you what you feel

Hey, yeah, why must it be the sign of something burning in the night to make us
hunger for the day
Oh, there ain't no mystery, just love enough to let it be
Everybody knows the way, yeah, the message is love

Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love (oh-oh)

Can you hear the sound, must be the ear-ear-ear-earth spinnin' 'round
We're gonna find out, just what the world, just what the world is all about
The message is love
