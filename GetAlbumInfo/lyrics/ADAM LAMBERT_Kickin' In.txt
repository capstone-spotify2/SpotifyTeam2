She wants to be up there
In the air where the clouds live
The sweetest seeds make the best trees
30, 000 feet she can smile and now

She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?

You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
Honey are you up there?

You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
Honey are you up there?

She wants to introduce me
To her friend Eddie
What is she tryin' to do to me?
He got words that rhyme
He got a dirty mind
Persuasive
Am I about to do it now?

She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now?
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?

You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
Honey are you up there?

You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
You can feel it, it's kickin in
Honey are you up there?

Bounce, bounce, bounce,
Bounce, bounce, bounce,
Bounce, bounce, bounce.
Bounce, bounce, bounce,
Bounce, bounce, bounce,
Bounce, bounce, bounce.

And now, she puts her shot glass down,
She asks for another round,
She wants to hit the clouds,
Honey are you up there?
Now, she puts her shot glass down,
She asks for another round,
Girl, don't you hit the ground,
