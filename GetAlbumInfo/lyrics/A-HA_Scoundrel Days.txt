Was that somebody screaming...
It wasn't me for sure
I lift my head up from uneasy 
pillows
Put my feet on the floor
Cut my wrist on a bad thought
And head for the door

Outside on the pavement
The dark makes no noise
I can feel the sweat on my lips
Leaking into my mouth
I'm heading out for the steep hills
They're leaving me no choice

And see...as our lives are in the making
We believe through the lies and the hating
That love goes free

For want of an option
I run the wind 'round
I dream pictures of houses burning
Never knowing nothing else to do
With death comes the morning
Unannounced and new

Was it too much to ask for
To pull a little weight...
They forgive anything but greatness
These are scoundrel days
And I'm close to calling out their names
As pride hits my face
See...as our lives are in the making
We believe through their lies and the hating
That love goes free through 
scoundrel days

I reach the edge of town
I've got blood in my hair
Their hands touch my body
From everywhere
But I know that I've made it
As I run into the air

And see...as our lives are in the making
We believe through the lies and the hating 
That love goes free
Through scoundrel days
