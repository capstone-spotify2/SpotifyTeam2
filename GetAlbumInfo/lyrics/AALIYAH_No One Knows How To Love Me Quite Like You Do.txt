No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do 
No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do

Liyah you're the only one for me,<i>[3x]</i>
the one for me, the one for me

<i>[chorus]</i>

No one knows how to love me quite like you do... <i>[4x]</i>

<i>[Verse 1]</i>

When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you put my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority

<i>[Bridge]</i>

(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
(Cause I like it) cause I like it, babe
Don't stop cause no one knows...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[Verse 2]</i>

When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your goddess

<i>[Bridge]</i>

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[rap]</i>
Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spitin' tracks, as if it were tobacco
It's the ninties, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "book", you say "read that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you...
Uh! Forever my man!!!

<i>[chorus]</i>

Liyah you're the only one for me, <i>[3x]</i>
the one for me, the one for me <i>[till fade...]</i>
