If you ever lost 
I can be your shelter in a storm 
I can be everything you need and more 
If you need someone to hold you 
When you're feeling oh so alone 
I will be right there to guide you home 

Even if it feels 
Too much for you to take 
Even if the sun 
Seems to fade away 
I will try my best to make it OK again 
I'll promise I'll stay oh baby I will be there 

Oh baby you can count on me 
Whenever the dark is all you see 
Baby when you feel afraid 
I'll try to give you 
The courage that you need 
Won't you count on me 

I know sometimes it's hard 
For you to believe it'll be OK (it'll be OK) 
I want you to trust that things 
Will turn out right 
When you feel like you're surrounded by a world 
That so cruel (so cruel) 
I will be right there by your side 

Even if it feels 
Too much for you to take
Even if the sun 
Seems to fade away
I will try my best to make it OK again 
I'll promise I'll stay oh baby (I'll promise I'll stay) 
I will be there 

Baby you can count on me 
Whenever the dark is all you see 
Baby when you feel afraid 
I'll try to give you The courage that you need 
Won't you count on me 

Even if everybody else 
Looks the other way
Never give up on hope 
Together we'll find away 
It may seems impossible now 
But later you'll see (later you'll see) 
Better days will come 
Oh baby 

Oh baby you can count on me (yeah) 
Whenever the dark is all you see 
Baby when you feel afraid (feel afraid) 
I'll try to give you (I'll try to give you) 
The courage that you need (baby) 
Won't you count on me 

Oh baby you can count on me 
Whenever the dark is all you see 
Baby when you feel afraid 
I'll try to give you 
The courage that you need 
Won't you count on me
