I wanted to save you
Give breath that escaped you
But you stayed down (stayed down)
To resuscitate you
Breath my breath back into you
You stayed out (stayed out)

I wanted to shake you
To scream to awaken you
You stayed down (stayed out)

In your slumber you saw everything
Everything but me

Why must we stop?
Why must we stop now?
Why must you crush our glow?
Don't you know that heaven is slow?
Don't remake our heaven

I wanted to save us
Wept words that escaped us
But you stayed out (You shut them out)
I fell down to face you
To find you were wakeful
And you'd forced me out, I'm nothing now

In your slumber you saved everything
Everything but me

Why must we stop?
Why must we stop now?
Why must you crush our glow?
Don't you know that heaven is slow?
Don't remake our heaven

Why must we stop?
Why must we stop now?
Why must you crush our glow?

Don't you know that heaven is slow?
Don't erase our heaven
