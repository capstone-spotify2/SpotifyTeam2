I pushed you away
How could I say those words I can't take back?
But now that you're gone
I can't see anything but you and me

But maybe it's too late
For us
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're right)
(Too late)
Give me a sign
(For us)
Maybe it's too late for us

Cannot let go, how will I know
That you'll understand?
Cause I want to run back, run to you
And tell you it all wasn't true

But maybe it's too late
For us
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're right)
(Too late)
Give me a sign
(For us)
Maybe it's too late for us

No one knows
No one knows
