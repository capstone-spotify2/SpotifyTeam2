The story begins like any other
We started off so wonderful
You left me high and dry as a bone
You cut me off and I donât blame you

Youâre needed out there
And everyone is calling you

To open up brighter skies
Show the world how to fly
Spread your wings and make things right
Open up brighter skies

Iâm wasted again
Too much time alone I guess
I donât know why
I can not stop
You left me high and dry as a bone
You cut me off and I donât blame you

Youâre needed out there
And everyone is calling you

To open up brighter skies
Show the world how to fly
Spread your wings and make things right
Open up brighter skies

Take me over
Take me there
Take me somewhere Iâve never been

(They count on you)
To open up brighter skies
Show the world how to fly
Spread your wings and make things right
Open up brighter skies
