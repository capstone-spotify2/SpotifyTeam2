You know I always had the strength to fight
But I got tired of the wars at night
Thinking they would end if I gave in
But I wasn't strong enough

..To let you win
..To let you win
..Let you win

I knew the fight but I didn't know the cost
And how to stop the wheels when they're in spin
I thought you couldn't love a man who'd lost
No, I wasn't strong enough

..To let you win
..Let you win

It used to scare me to wake up wondering
If I'd forgotten what I was fighting for
You know that you said that you were weak and I was strong
Well, I wasn't strong enough

..To let you win
..To let you win
..Let you win
..To let you win

You know I always had the strength to fight
But I got tired of the wars at night
Thinking they would end if I gave in
But I wasn't strong enough

..To let you win
..To let you win
