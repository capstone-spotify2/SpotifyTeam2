Up until the day you met the family
Youâd never felt that pain begin to drain, oh!
And up until the day you sold the family
Youâd kept that fractured face from being shown.

Letâs play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones.
Now finally you can see me turn to stone.

Up until the day you cracked the fountain
Iâd never felt my life drain in that way, oh!
Up until that day you tainted the water
Youâd kept that average face from being shown.

Letâs play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones.
Now finally you can see me turn to stone.

Whoa
Dumb kids
Dumb kids
Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Dumb kids

Letâs play
Turn to stone
Like you played with broken bones.
Now finally you can see me turn to stone.

Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Were we only playing like dumb kids?
Dumb kids
Dumb kids
