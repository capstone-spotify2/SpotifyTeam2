Ev'ry man I meet is in a hurry to find a new romance
Always wanna leave the party early, maybe I like to dance
Slowly, if you really wanna love me
Take it easy when you hold me, I might let go
Back to, straight into, look me in the eyes
If you want to (want to) talk to me
Take your time, don't be shy, tell me your name
If you want to (want to) walk with me
I'm the kind to wait for somethin' special instead of fallin' too fast
I believe the night is something precious, that's why I want it to last
So, slowly, if you really wanna love me
Take it easy when you hold me, don't let me go
Back to, straight into, look me in the eyes
If you want to (want to) talk to me
Take your time, don't be shy, tell me your name
If you want to (want to) walk with me
What are we gonna do
You're little lookin' like you're somethin' new
And I like the way you move
I don't let it go
Oh, back to, straight into, look me in the eyes
If you want to (want to) talk to me
Take your time, don't be shy, tell me your name
If you want to (want to) walk with me
Little by little I'll let you know
If I want you to take clutch to me
