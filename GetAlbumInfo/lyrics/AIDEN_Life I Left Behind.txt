I remember when I used to wake up
I remember what I used to be
I remember how I used to wake up so wrong now
I remember this life I left behind
On empty shelves 
In empty rooms
In lifeless skies
In lifeless skies
In empty shells
I remember when I used to
Be my own self
I remember when
We were so young
I remember when I used to
Wake up so lost now
I remember when
we were so 
My friend
My own
My end

Break 
watch me break

She won't have to stand and walk alone now
to stand and walk alone
Don't have to stand and walk between us now 
forever wanting

This life has never made me question
is it wrong to think
how empty is the answers
This life has never made me question
is it wrong to think
how empty is the answers

This life I left behind
This life I left behind for you
Arrghhh!!!
