That night I still remember
It was warm in the middle of summer
Your voice like a lullaby, so low, so sweet
Thought you had me but Iâd never been so free

Now youâre scared but you donât know why
You keep running but thereâs nowhere to hide

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
You never thought Iâd ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just canât get over me

Weâll spend the night watching movies in the dark
Youâre playing bands Iâve never heard of
And I know you tend to always overthink
But tonight itâs as simple as just kiss me

Now youâre scared but you donât know why
You keep running but thereâs nowhere to hide
Scared to care because then you lose
Try and hide how you feel but I feel it, too

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Take all of your doubts and throw them away
Weâre falling tonight tell me that youâll stay
Youâll stay

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
