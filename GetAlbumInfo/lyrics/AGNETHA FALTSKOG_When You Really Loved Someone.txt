Soul searchin'
Heartbroken
Eyes open
Some say
You're only cryin' in the dark

Life changes,
Rearranges
Time passes
Some say
You're only cryin' in the dark

He promised you his love would last forever
The day he said goodbye
All you wanted
Was to lay down and die

When you loved someone
Really loved someone
And you lost that one
Well, then nothing really matters
No forgiveness, no politeness
No one else could take his place
No one, no one
Oh-ooh

Come together, honey
Let him go now, honey
Save your heart
They say
No more cryin' in the dark

Gotta break loose, have some fun
Let yourself go, come undone
I know your friends mean well, but
Ooh

When you loved someone
Really loved someone
And you lost that one
Well, then nothing really matters
No forgiveness, no politeness
No one else could take his place
No one, no one
When you really loved someone
Loved someone

You'll never be the same

Hmmâ¦
When you loved someone
Really loved someone
And you lost that one
Well, then nothing really matters
No forgiveness, no politeness
No one else could take his place
No one, no one
No one
When you really loved someone.
