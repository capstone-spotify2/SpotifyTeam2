Flat line, no life
Give it to me, there's no one around
If I fly too high
You suffocate me just to keep me down
I let you in under my skin and now you taste it
Another hit, another reason you made me

So low, so low
So low, so low

Why do you hate me?
Why do you take me to the bottom of myself?
If you wanna relieve me
Why do you make me feel like I'm in hell
Sticks and stones can break my bones
Can break my bones in two
But only you know what to say to get me
To get me, get me low

So low, so low
You make me feel
So low, so low

Too close, shadow
Drawing out all this misery
I'm in deep, I can't sleep
<i>[incomprehensible]</i> before your sympathy
And now you're in under my skin, you sink your teeth in
Another hit, another reason you made me

Why do you hate me?
Why do you take me to the bottom of myself?
If you wanna relieve me
Why do you make me feel like I'm in hell
Sticks and stones can break my bones
Can break my bones in two
But only you know what to say to get to me
To get me, get me low

So low, so low
You make me feel
So low, so low
You make me feel

I'm feeling so high
Now I'm feeling low
Maybe it's time that I should let it go
It's lifting me up
Now I'm underground
You make me feel
You make me feel
So low, so low
So low, so low

Why do you hate me?
Why do you take me to the bottom of myself?
You wanna relieve me
Why do you make me feel like I'm in hell
Sticks and stones can break my bones
Can break my bones in two
But only you know what to say to get me
To get me, get me low

So low, so low
You make me feel
So low, so low
You make me feel
So low, so low
You make me feel
So low, so low
You make me feel
