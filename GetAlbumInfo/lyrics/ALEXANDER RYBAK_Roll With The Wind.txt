I won't blame the hurting on you
You left in the sweetest way
I won't say that it's you
Making me feel this way
It's the heart and the soul and the body and the brain
Driving me insane 
But the wind and the land and the fire and the rain 
Always stay the same

I wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
I, oh
I wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
I, I

I won't claim it's all cause of you
I guess that I played a part
It's just that I never knew
I'd fall for you from the start
There's a hole in my heart and a picture in a frame
Driving me insane
But the wind and the land and the fire and the rain
Always stay the same

I wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
I, oh
I wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
I, I

I would never blame you for the heartache
I would never blame you for the tears
I blame my stubborn heart, soul, body
Every single thing around me stays the same
No matter what

I wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
I, oh
I wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
I, I

I wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
I, oh
I wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
I, I
