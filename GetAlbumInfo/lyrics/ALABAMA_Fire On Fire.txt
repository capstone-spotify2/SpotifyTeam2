He was a stranger in a little town
She was sittin' alone in a crowd
Listening to the old jukebox playin' a song
From the moment we walked through the diner door
She felt something like never before
A feelin' so strong right from the start
It wouldn't stop - it was more than a spark

Fire on fire they were burnin' up
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try
'Cause fire on fire just won't die

It was gettin' late but they had all night
They sat there talkin' 'bout their lives
He was sellin', she was gettin' ready to buy
That ole neon light was glowin' dim
But he could see by the way she was lookin' at him
Tonight would be different, somethin' had changed
His lonely heart was feelin' a flame

Fire on fire they were burnin' up
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try
'Cause fire on fire just won't die

She needed him, he needed her
And they both knew, without a word
There was no question, there was no doubt
There was no way they could put it out

Fire on fire they were burnin' up
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched
Fire on fire, in each other's eyes they just had to try
'Cause fire on fire, fire on fire
Fire on fire just won't die

Oh, no
Fire on fire
Just won't die
Fire on fire...
