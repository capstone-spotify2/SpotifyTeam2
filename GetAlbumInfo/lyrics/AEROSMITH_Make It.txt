Good evening people, welcome to the show!
Got something here I want you all to know
When laughin' people bring on primal screams
You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams!

Make it!
Don't break it
I said make it!
Don't break it
Do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you

You know that history repeats itself!
But you just learned, so by somebody else
You know you do, you gotta think up fast
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last!

Make it!
Donât fake it
I said make it!
Donât fake it
Then you do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues!
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose!

You're only paying your dues!

Too stinkinâ proud but youâre gonna pay!
If youâre gone Iâll get you anyway
Although you know what youâve been goinâ through!
Your only dreams feel like a tattoo!

Make it!
Donât break it
I said make it!
Donât break it
Then you do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues!
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose!
