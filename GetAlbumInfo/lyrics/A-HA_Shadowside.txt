The shadowside 
You say I have
Is making everything 
Go bad

You say I donât 
Care enough
For all the things that
I have got

But I do
And I will

I donât want to see myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If you ever let me go again,
In the shadowside Iâll end

The shadowside
Where I go
Iâm never where
Iâm needed so

You say I donât
Give enough
That I donât care for
All Iâve got

But I do
And I will

I donât want to see myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If youâre letting go of me again,
In the shadowside Iâll end
