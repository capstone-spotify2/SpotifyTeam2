She had the word
Had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game
Called the play
She hit me low
Said now you go your way
I'll go mine
And that's the start
Doctor, doctor
Ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

Don't need no drink
Don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later
Send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator
Long distance lips
On the telephone
Come tomorrow
Come to grips
With being all alone

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

A bullet to bite on
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Come on now
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Bullet to chew
I'll make the lady chew
I'll make the lady chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on
You're a bullet baby
I want a bullet to bite on
