Change with the light

Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Change with the light
Change with the light

Smile on my face
Like doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
I'm changing
I change with the light
Hiding away running from reality
Who am I
Am a doctor in this game

Aaah

Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right
Feel my vibrations
I will change with the light
Feel my body talk
Be mine
Never Stop
Shake it right
In the night

Change with the light
Change with the light

Morning has come
As the sun catches my face
I realise I'm alone with myself
Yesterday all was dark
I was dancing on the floor
In this light
I'm completely another me

Oooh
Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right
Feel my vibrations
I will change with the light
Feel my body talk
Be mine
Never Stop
Shake it right
In the night

Change with the light
Change with the light

Rock it to the beat
While you're shaking my mind
Changing my face
Cause you were mine
Excited by your beauty
Makes me totally blind
Hypnotise me
Mess up my mind

All the voices
I can't resist my night sight
All the choices
That the daylight brings
Like a diamond
Sparkling and shining
All my hours
Don't don't stop the music

Change with the light
Change with the light

Oooh
Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right
Feel my vibrations
I will change with the light
Feel my body talk
Be mine
Never Stop
Shake it right
In the night

Change with the light
Change with the light

Change with the light

Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right
Feel my vibrations
I will change with the light
Feel my body talk
Be mine
Never Stop
Shake it right
In the night

Change with the light
Change with the light

Change with the light

Change with the light
Turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right (Change with the light)

Oh, change with the light
Feel my body talk
Be mine
Never Stop
Shake it right
In the night

Change with the light

Change with the light
Turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
