Where there is heartache
Where there is hatred
Where there is suffering
You are there
Where I am wounded
Where I was weeping
Where I was weakest
You are there

All the way You fill my cup
In the fire You held me up

Jesus You were, You are
You always will be there
Jesus You were, You are
You always will be there
Why would I run? 
I know You're here
When You are with me
There's nothing to fear
Jesus You were, You are
You always will be

Where there is hope and
Where there is mercy
Where there is justice
You are there
When I needed breakthrough
When I needed healing
When I need freedom
You are there

Savior 
Reigning for ever
You have been
And You will always be
Holy, Lord God almighty
You have been
And You will always be
