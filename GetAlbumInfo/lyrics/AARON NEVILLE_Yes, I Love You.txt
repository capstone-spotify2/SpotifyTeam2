I'm changing my mind,
Never gonna learn about how to feel again
Cause you, you've opened my heart,
And I just can't hide, I love you still.

I know you mean it, when you say you need me,
You say you won't leave me, you'll always be here,
You won't regret it, cause I'll never leave you,
And I won't deceive you, I need you too,

Yes, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Yes, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Oh I do, girl, I love you

We belong together, loving forever, enjoying this life,
We'll do what's right, we'll do it tonight, will you be my wife
I know you mean it, when you say you need me, won't ever leave me,
Saying you'll be right here my baby,

You won't regret it, no, don't you forget it,
I'll never deceive you, I need you too.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Yes, I love you, I love you,
I love you

Forgive me for what I've put you through,
I'm learning to put my trust in you,
Believe in me and I'll show you,
Cause I'll always be here,
I love you

I love you baby, oh I love you baby, I love you,
I love you, from the bottom of my heart girl,
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you
I love you, love you, love you, love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, love you, I love you,
Oh believe me darling
