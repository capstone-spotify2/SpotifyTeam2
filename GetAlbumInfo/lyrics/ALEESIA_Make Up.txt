You've been in love
Is it not enough?
Cause it feels like we're running in circles

Two worlds apart
But the same at heart
Don't know what it is but something feels wrong

What's your confession?
Wanna tell me now?
You need more time?
Will you tell me later?

Here's my suggestion
Get it off your chest
But don't pretend
That it won't happen again

Whenever we make up
It's your sense of apology
That gets to the heart of me
Until it starts again

And we break up
We both know we're playing games
And inside we feel the same
When we're the ones to blame

We make up and break up and make up
We promise not to fight again
Until we break up and make up and break up
Tell me when we'll wake up

We wanna talk
But we won't give in
Cause we are too worried about who's gonna win

It's not your fault
But you should remind
We been here before, we're wasting time

Here's my confession
Wanna tell you now
Don't need more time
Gotta tell you later

What's your suggestion?
Should I hold it in
And to myself
That it won't happen again

Whenever we make up
It's your sense of apology
That gets to the heart of me
Until it starts again

And we break up
We both know we're playing games
And inside we feel the same
When we're the ones to blame

We make up and break up and make up
We promise not to fight again
Until we break up and make up and break up
Tell me when we'll wake up

Baby, we'll get it through
Cause no matter the weather
Our love has kept us together

I can't live without you
And I don't want to do this again, yeah
Do this again, no, no, no

Whenever we make up
It's your sense of apology
That gets to the heart of me
Until it starts again

And we break up
We both know we're playing games
And inside we feel the same
When we're the ones to blame

We make up and break up and make up
We promise not to fight again
Until we break up and make up and break up
However we break up
Tell me when we'll wake up

We're still in love
And that's enough
