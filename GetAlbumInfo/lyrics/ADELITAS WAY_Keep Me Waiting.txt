There's the road, you should go
Cause every time we talk we fight
And you don't have to let me know this show
Everything you say sets in slow, again
Just got done wondering now I know you're gone
It's gone away

How could you keep me still here waiting?
And I feel when I try
And you'll tell me they'll be no sunshine
How could we have this conversation?
And I feel when I walk
A thousand miles for you is too long

There's no rose, you should know
Seven little cross we've tried
You don't have to send me off, I'll go
It's every single day was let me know
A man has got me wondering why I lost your love
It's gone away

How could you keep me still here waiting?
And I feel when I try
And you'll tell me they'll be no sunshine
How could we have this conversation?
And I feel when I walk
A thousand miles for you is too long
Is too long
Is too long
Is too long

Down that road, down that road
I see your conscious swaying
I see it in your eyes
I feel like its the first time that I'm ripped up inside
And the other one's trying
I see you constantly with him, I feel it in your vein
I feel that I guess the first time that I'm ripped up inside
And the other one's trying

How could you keep me still here waiting?
Cause I'm feeling like the something sorrow
