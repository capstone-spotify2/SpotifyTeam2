My first ride
Wait outside
I'm steppin' inside

I don't really care
What everybody says
That a hot ride with the girls away, anyway
All I wanna do is drive, okay
Can't stay, can't stay, and I can't wait
Any day, any day now
It's official
AC, I'ma place my initials
You little weasels
Now I got diesel
I can hold the steering
Real steady, get steady
When I gotta refuel
Crank the track up
Now I'm grown up, and all sewn up
I'm comin' through
With the system blastin'
Bangin' my head
Hell raisers raisin'

Watch me
Ride 'til the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go
Don't tempt me
I wanna roll to the Hoop
In the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'

Catch me
Or ya gonna be
Left lonely
In the dust
Of the one and only
Can't hold me
Control me
When I'ma
Ridin', ridin', riding
(uh uh ah ah ah ah uh ah ah ah uh)
Ridin', ridin', riding
(uh uh ah ah ah ah uh ah ah ah uh)
Ridin', ridin', riding

Trouble burn
Rubber burn
It's my turn
I'm here when you cross the road
Mark the turn
Feels like Formula One
But oh no
I'm getting pulled over
By the one five oh
What the deal, yo, uh
Officer tell me
What's the problemo

(You were driven way to slow)
(You gotta do 60 you were doing a 4-0)

Let me see your drivers license
And registration
I don't need one, it's Aaron's Alien Nation

I'm just Carter
Here we go, then I laugh
If you let me off I'll
Write your daughter and autograph
Then he laughed, and said 'sure'
Gimme your ticket
He said 'boy look'
Get outta here before I lose my cool
And act like a driver
(You know the rules)

Watch me
Ride 'til the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go
Don't tempt me
I wanna roll to the Hoop
In the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'

Catch me
Or ya gonna be
Left lonely'
In the dust
Of the one and only
Can't hold me
Control me
When I'ma
Ridin', ridin', riding
(uh uh ah ah ah ah uh ah ah ah uh)
Ridin', ridin', riding
(uh uh ah ah ah ah uh ah ah ah uh)
Ridin', ridin', riding

Slow down

My first ride
I'm steppin' inside

Watch me
Ride 'til the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go
Don't tempt me
I wanna roll to the Hoop
In the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'

Catch me
Or ya gonna be
Left lonely'
In the dust
Of the one and only
Can't hold me
Control me
When I'ma
Ridin', ridin', riding

Watch me
Ride 'til the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go
Don't tempt me
I wanna roll to the Hoop
In the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'

Catch me
Or ya gonna be
Left lonely'
In the dust
Of the one and only
Can't hold me
Control me
When I'ma
Ridin', ridin', riding
(uh uh ah ah ah ah uh ah ah ah uh)
Ridin', ridin', riding

Ridin', ridin', riding
