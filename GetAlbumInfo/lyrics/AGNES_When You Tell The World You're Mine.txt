I'm standig by an angel
Tears well up inside
Feelings are belonging
Of graditute and pride

I'm blindet by your presence
In this moment that we're in
If God was to describe you
Where would he begin
Your colours blend together
And you become the light

If only you could see the way you shine
Darling when you tell the world you're mine

You're the future I belive in
I know you through and through
Your each and every heartbeat every breath

Everytime I look at you
I'm blindet by your presence
In this moment that we're in
If God was to describe you
Where would he begin
Your colours blend together
And you become the light

If only you could see the way you shine
Darling when you tell the world you're mine

You're mine against all odds my love
What we have it is unbreakable

If God was to describe you
Where would he begin

I'm blindet by your presence
In this moment that we're in
If God was to describe you
Where would he begin
Your colours blend together
And you become the light

If only you could see the way you shine
Darling when you tell the world you're mine

I'm standing by an angel
