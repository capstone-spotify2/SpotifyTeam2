I was lost before I found
The danger in love, the danger in love
Lost my breath to the ground
But the danger in love, the danger in love

Keeps me hanging on
Hanging on, hanging on

Feels like I've got nothing to lose something, lose something
Holding forever, will I lose something, lose something?
Shake off the leather from my face something, face something
Hold you forever, will I lose something, lose something?

I was cursed, where did I go?
With fear in my hand, and a chill in my soul
Lost, now I can see
The danger in love, she's all I need

She keeps me hanging on
She keeps me hanging on

Feels like I've got nothing to lose something, lose something
Holding forever, will I lose something, lose something?
Shake off the leather from my face something, face something
Hold you forever, will I lose something, lose something?

Keeps me hanging on
Ooh, keeps me hanging on
Keeps me hanging on

Feels like I've got nothing to lose something, lose something
Holding forever, will I lose something, lose something?
Shake off the leather from my face something, face something
Hold you forever, will I lose something, lose something?
