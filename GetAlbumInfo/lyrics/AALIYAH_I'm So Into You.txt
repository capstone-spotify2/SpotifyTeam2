<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
Baby can't you see I got a thing for you
I really like the way you do the things you do
Take control of me fullfill my fantasies
Here's my pager number won't you get with me

<i>[Bridge]</i>
It's just the little things you do that turns me on
You really turn me on
And you got it goin' on I'm into you

<i>[Chorus]</i>

<i>[verse 2]</i>
My dear I feel so weak you knock me off my feet
And it's good to know you love me just for me
I'll be here all the time I'll never let you go
There is something that I have to let you know

<i>[bridge]</i>

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[rap]</i>
Well can't you see Aaliyah's got a thing for you
And the second chapter like the things you do
So pull up to my bumper and I'll ride wit' you
And let's go rollin' down a block or two
Now add a little bass to the E Q button
Now all of a sudden I gotta whisper sweet little nothing
Aaliyah told me to tell you to call her
(I'm so into you)

<i>[chorus till fade...]</i>

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na!!!
