(Oooh yeah)
Burnin' alive, set my soul on fire
Runnin' with a gun, this place is gonna burn
No firewater, or novacaine
No thunderstorm, no john wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So watch out 'cause this place is gonna burn

Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
(burnin' alive, burnin' alive)

They be smokin' your hide, come runnin' wild
Tell you nothin' to fear, cause the buck stops here!
He came from a little town called hope
And someday, maybe, it'll go up in smoke

(I say)
No firewater, or novacaine,
No thunderstorm, and no john wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So watch out, cause this place is gonna burn

Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all out war, an all out war
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive

Somewhere, there's a little town called hope
And someday, maybe baby, he'll inhale that smoke!

(yeah, we're) burnin' alive, burnin' alive
(burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive)
It's an all out war, an all out war
Hear the battle roar, it's an all out war
(yeah we're) burnin' alive, burnin' alive
(burnin' alive, burnin' alive)

(yeah) watch the place burn down
