The word is out; there's gonna be a gang fight
Everybody knows that someone's goin' down
The night is hot; the moon is like a spotlight
So many screams; I swear I never heard a sound
Not a sound

You hear the sirens sing all night long
To live in the jungle, boy, you gotta be strong

Sometimes you gotta fight
(Get ready!)
There's the cut of the knife
(Get ready!)
So roll the dice on your life
(I'm ready!)
And pray the night don't bite you

See the switchblade dance, a brother go down
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
There's a new breed comin', gonna rock this town
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
You better run for your life
(Get ready!)
'Cause if you're standin' up, we'll fight you

Well it's a war zone, baby, and I need a friend
Even the rats are out of town by ten
You better keep your ass behind locked doors
While the cops treat all this like a civil war

So here they come to fight
(Get ready!)
You better watch your back tonight
(Get ready!)
I got them in my sights
(I'm ready!)
Rumble!!!

Well you're all invited to a switchblade dance
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
You're quick on your feet; it might be your last chance
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
And if I hit you once, you're gonna kiss the ground
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
'Cause there's a new kid comin', gonna take this crown
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
You better run for your life
(Get ready!)
'Cause if you're standin' up, we'll fight you

Can you hear the sound... of an ambulance going downtown?
Nobody's safe tonight!

I see the names there written all along the wall in
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
Don't have to buy the paper, you can read it all in
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
You know that just last night, I lost another friend
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
One of these nights, it's gonna have to end
(Blood on the bricks, blood on the bricks)
But 'till then...

(Get ready!)
(Are you ready?)
(I'm ready!)

Rumble!!!
