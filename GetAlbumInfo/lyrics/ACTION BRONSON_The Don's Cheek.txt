<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Catch me on Venice Beach working on my base, no blonde streak
Swimming trunk, 30K in arm's reach
I'm on the boat, in the water like a swan's feet
To show respect you kiss both sides of the Don's cheek
360 on the Seadoo in a tux
Call my homie, tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Placido Polanco Crib, his bitch was black
She started purring, I kissed the cat
Aristocrat, wrist dancing like a disco bass
In the holster, same shit color as Sisqo's hair
635 slam like a suplex
Cheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test
I'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the chunky coupe
Hold on, wait till it thunder, here's the gun to shoot
Beige leather to the calf, where my math at?
You gonna babysit my joint? Then pussy pass that

<i>[Hook:]</i>
I'm getting paper regardless, I'm never facing no charges
I got your honor under the armpit
The gavel slam and I walk
Hammer dances on the porch, downtown gallivanting with a horse
Two different drugs to choose, I need the third thing
Oriental style shirt
Flapping in the wind like a bird's wing
I need that good green, ugh, motherfucker need that good green

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
I got the face like a grown lion, my people hold iron
Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan
Hold my son up, show him to the kingdom
While all his blood brothers became drug runners in England
Made in Queens, Handball courts and 40s
Shorties smoking blunts, spades in the corner
We moving white like David Spade in the sauna
All the money chronological, it look like callaloo
Provide the crew designer suits, exotic food
Erotic nude and polished shoes, impala smooth
Roll up, looking like Sinbad with the earring
Lightskin sucking my penis while I'm steering
I'm pro
