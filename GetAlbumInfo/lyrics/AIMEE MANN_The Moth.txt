The moth don't care when he sees the flame
He might get burned, but he's in the game
And once he's in, he can't go back
He'll beat his wings till he burns them black

No, the moth don't care when he sees the flame
No, the moth don't care when he sees the flame

The moth don't care if the flame is real
'Cause flame and moth got a sweetheart deal
And nothing fuels a good flirtation
Like need and anger and desperation

No, the moth don't care if the flame is real
No, the moth don't care if the flame is real

So come on, let's go, ready or not
'Cause there's a flame I know, hotter than hot
And with a fuse that's so thoroughly shot, away

The moth don't care if the flame burns low
'Cause moth believes in an afterglow
And flames are never doused completely
All you really need is the love of heat

No, the moth don't care if the flame burns low
No, the moth don't care if the flame burns low

So come on, let's go, ready or not
'Cause there's a flame I know, hotter than hot
And with a fuse that's so thoroughly shot, away
