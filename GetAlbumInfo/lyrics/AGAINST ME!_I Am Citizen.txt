Christ we were dying in the streets running one last anthem through your heart. Swearing life on liberty I'll take a dream an ideal die sound in a lonely death. Pass this compromise on...... My regrets to Columbus (GA) and nothing more when Reagan became the final word. Just one month later they shot Lennon dead, will anybody cry for me? All nations claim until they day that I die, I am citizen. We'll let music rule our life, celebrate shortcomings. If it's not angry young and beautiful, I don't want any part of it. Who do you have to cheat to get what you want, who do you lie to, to get what you need? You deserve everything you got coming to you... 

(just because you can't play an instrument doesn't mean you shouldn't.)
