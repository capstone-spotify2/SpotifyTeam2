Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Hanging with my homies
Talking jive
Smoking marijuana, drinking Cult 45
Hey homeboy, let's get drunk today

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Bumping my music very loud
Limping down the sidewalk so high
Slap my brother, let's get drunk tonight

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Now I'm nice and tipsy
And I'm high-igh
Flirting with the ladies
Walking by-ie-ie
Hey pretty lady, let's hook up tonight

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Buckaa!
