I've been riding these blue highways
Another night has made me stop
My weary bones can go no farther
And here's where they'll drop

In my dreams your arms will find me
They will hold me through the night
Then release me to my journey
As another day grows light

I've got so many miles to go
And promises to keep
Right now all I wanna do
Is be anywhere on earth you are

I've always been a gypsy
And the road calls me to roam
But each day brings me closer
To the place where we call home

Still got many miles to go
And promises to keep
Right now all I wanna do
Is be anywhere on earth you are

In my dreams your arms will find me
They will hold me through the night
Right now all I wanna do
Is be anywhere on earth you are
