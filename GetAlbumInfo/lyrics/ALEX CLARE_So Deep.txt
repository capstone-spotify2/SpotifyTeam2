You know I got a fire
Burnin' so deep
You know I got a fire
Burnin' so deep
And it burns so sweetly
Make a man weep

I got a love
Older than time
Yes, I have a love
That's older than time
And the way it feels
It must be the reason why

Got this burning
Down in my bones
Got this burning
Down in my bones
And the way it feels
It moves my soul

You know it's so good
Touching you so madly
You are the only one
That can ever set me free

You know my flesh
It burns
So, so, long
Yes, my flesh
It hungers
So, so, long

Like a man in giant dusty land
Nowhere to go
I'm like a man in a giant dusty land
With nowhere to call home
