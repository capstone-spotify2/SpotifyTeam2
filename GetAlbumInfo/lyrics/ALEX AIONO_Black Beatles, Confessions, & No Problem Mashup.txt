That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world all her friends know me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

<i>[Will:]</i>
Every time I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called I told you, "Baby, I'm working."
I was out doing my dirt
Wasn't thinking 'bout you getting hurt
Hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like
Man, not givin' a damn who sees me

<i>[Both:]</i>
So gone, so wrong
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinking about me, bein' the good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you've a good man
One that never would do the thing
I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself it ain't good

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one, on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
Guess, I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I gotta tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so gone I don't know what to do
But to give part 2 of my confessions

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
If one more label tryna stop me
There's gon' be some dreadhead hittas in ya lobby (huh!)

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
Will and Alex ridin' through the streets,
They'll be like "There he go!"

<i>[Alex:]</i>
OK OK it's okay
Girl, your body so sweet like a Yoplait but you say I gotta wait
Cause I know you ain't the type of girl hitting third base on a first date
This different though
Love so quick holla Usain Bolt
And I really hated to see you go
So hit me up when you get back home

<i>[Will:]</i>
I got what you need
Smooth like WD
You weak at the knees
SWV no one love you back to sleep (C-Breezy!)
Free verse yeah I got that
R&amp;B for the pop tracks
Finna pop that
Two bros from Ngati Porou
Tell me how you gonna stop that

You don't want no problem
Want no problem with me
