I ain't been gettin' high...
Not even a little, baby I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly, I...

Notice, you think that you know this
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh yeah

Otay, pray them haters go away
Always hella clowns around here, look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This is still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a snow day

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I

Mama told me not to sell work, sell work
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt
Mama told me not to sell work
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt

I spy with my little eye
Oh, I
I spy with my little eye
I spy with my little eye
Whoa
I spy with my little eye

Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
That, you all know this song right? Let's go

Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old

Know some young hittas like to swang, like to swang
Know some young hittas like to swang
Know some young hittas like to swang, swang, swang
Know some young hittas like to swang
Hop out, drop, top, what y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

I spy with my little eye
Mama told me not to sell work
I spy with my little eye
Isn't she wonderful
