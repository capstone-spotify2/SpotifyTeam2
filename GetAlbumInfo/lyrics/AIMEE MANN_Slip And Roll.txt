You went from moonlighting
but you came out fighting
I saw you larger than life
throwing your knife
gone into deep hiding

But you were so charming
that it was disarming
I wondered what was behind
having to find
an army that keeps arming

Oh, Slip and roll, honey
stick the jab, kid
donât just trade punches
like your father did
cause this playing the odds
isnât fooling the gods
so slip and roll til youâre willing to take the hit

So we just keep hoping
although the deckâs sloping
youâre thinking, Throw me a bone
or leave me alone
to do what they call coping

Oh, Slip and roll, honey
stick the jab, kid
donât just trade punches
like your father did
cause this playing the odds
isnât fooling the gods
so slip and roll til youâre willing to take the hit

And you can take it, take it, take it, take it
weâve all seen that guy take it on the chin
oh, take it, take it, I know you can take it
but when will you take something in

Oh, Slip and roll, honey
stick the jab, kid
donât just trade punches
like your father did
cause this playing the odds
isnât fooling the gods
so slip and roll til youâre willing to take the hit

And you can take it, take it, take it, take it
weâve all seen that guy take it on the chin
oh, take it, take it, I know you can take it
but when will you take something in
when will you take something in
