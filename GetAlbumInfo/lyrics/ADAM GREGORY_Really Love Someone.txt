its feelin like a week
but it could have been an hour
could have been a minute
since i watched you go
i'm feeling incomplete
a little outta beat
feelin like i just lost
what i was looking for
then you see her standin
like a face in the crowd and its raining down
and you just walk by on your lonely way home
and you think about it
could have maybe changed your mind
but i guess now you just dont know
you just dont know
no your never gonna know

when you really love somebody
when you really love someone
when you really think about it
and you just get numb
when youre feeling like theres never
gonna be another one
when you really love someone

thinkin maybe i
better swallow my pride
cause it sure aint worth missin you
sometimes when the weak get weak
and the strong get confused
when you win you lose
then you see her standin
and shes all dressed up
lookin so darn good
you wanna take her home
and you think about it
could have maybe changed your life
but i guess now you just dont know
you just dont know
no youre never gonna know

when you really love somebody
when you really love someone
when you really think about it
and you just get numb
when youre feeling like theres never
gonna be another one
when you really love someone

you wanna hide it
you wanna fight it
you wanna drop it
and right

when you really love somebody
when you really love someone
when you really think about it
and you just get numb
when youre feeling like theres never
gonna be another one
when you really love someone
