Oh where did it begin,
This desire in my heart
Born from out of the wind,
Left alone in the dark
Sow the desolate plain,
New horizons to share
All my Eden divide,
Generations to share

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Don't stop, it feels so familiar
Stay here and show me a new sunrise
You know I want you,
Can the innocent survive
And if I love you, can we touch to stay alive
For every reason, I will do the best I can
Daytime hunger, night is woman,
Primitive man
All the future is passed
With a wave of my hand
All direction is cast
From the woman and man

<i>[Chorus]</i>
