Your pretty face disguised in a veil of fear
Drip with tears
As I gave you one last kiss 
Before the fall 
(Before the fall)
Hold my hand you're so beautiful
Let's escape from this life and end it all
On three, we're jumping from this ledge
This building's tall
I'm sure we'll wake up dead
But I still love her

Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we'll make it last
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye

A picture perfect attempt at
A quick and painless death
Came and meant 
Something so much more 
Than all the rest 
(Than all the rest)
Hold my hand and don't forget to breathe
There's nothing left for you
There's nothing left to leave
On three, we're jumping from this ledge
This building's tall
I'm sure we'll wake up dead
But I still love her

Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we'll make it last
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we're falling fast

With these moments we hold dear 
(Inside my heart)
And the seconds we have left
(Inside my heart)
I know you're here inside my heart

With these moments we hold dear 
(Inside my heart)
And the seconds we have left
(Inside my heart)
I know you're here inside my heart

Hold your hand with mine
In this picture perfect light
There's one last chance for us
Tonight
I hold your hand with mine 
So everything is fine
So say goodbye, now say goodbye 
Tonight

Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we'll make it last
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Yeah, we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
Say goodbye (Goodbye)
