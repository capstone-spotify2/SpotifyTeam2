Elvaston Place, a run-down basement in South Ken 
Hiding your face behind the railings in the rain
Stony steps to a small grey herd of dustbins blinking in the sunlight
Our yesterday lives crouched by the fireside
In Elvaston Place.

Holes in the lace, curtains, splintery window frames
A small furnished space, we never knew the landlord's name
Electric bar to warm your winter toes, evening paper for the bath mat
Watching the face, happy beside me
In Elvaston Place.

The city's spreading like a stony tide across the countryside
I live alone now in London town
Cars and buses everywhere, they hide the sun and eat the air
You need a friend when it gets you down.

All the money that I've ever owned, I'd give it all tomorrow
If I could lay happy beside you
In Elvaston Place.

Elvaston Place, I stopped to look at you today
New whitewashed face behind the railings in the rain
You once held a love of mine, she changed just like the weather
The Kensington skies go on for ever
In Elvaston Place.
