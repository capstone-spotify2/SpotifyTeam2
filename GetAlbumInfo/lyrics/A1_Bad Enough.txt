Baby come back, hear me out
Is there any way to reach you now
Sitting on the edge thinking out loud
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know

Crying out loud, I wanna do good
I do it all for you if I could
The way it looks now from where I stood
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know

But running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough

Take a little time think this through
See it from another point of view
Putting myself in any old shoes
Maybe there is somewhere that you go
Somewhere that only you go

Trying to move on, all the way down
Waiting for your head to hit the ground
Whatever you're in we'll figure it out
I'll tell you there is something I do know
That wherever you go

Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad <i>[x4]</i>
If you want it bad enough

All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
All in your head (you can fight, you can fight)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head
You can fight it

Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough <i>[x2]</i>
