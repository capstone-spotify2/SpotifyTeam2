I know you're leaving
I won't ask you to stay
I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If that's what you've gotta do
I understand

It's not that easy setting you free
But that's how it's gotta be
And as you're walking away
As I'm watching you go
There's one thing I want you to know

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no one's there to hold
And you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday I'm just a heartbeat away, wo

Saying goodbye isn't saying we're through
Just know through it all I'm still here for you
Light a light in the window
When your lost in the dark, ooh
These arms would be happy to hold you again
If ever you miss me or when you
Start thinking about
All the nights that we shared
Darling you know I'll be there

<i>[Repeat Chorus without last line]</i>

You walk to the door with nothing to say
I look in your eyes and you look away
You're leaving me now, but darling I hope
Hope - that you'll look back someday

(and remember my heart's with you...)
