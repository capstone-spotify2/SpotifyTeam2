Liars and murderers, pale faced intruders
Came one day to our shores
Years of deceit and injustice and greed
Led to the crimes and the wars
Hopelessly wronged, dragged from our homes
Placed into stockades
Loaded on wagons as cattle or sheep
Silently filled with this rage

And all through the nights, we sang and we cried
holding on dearly
What gives you the right to do this
Who are the savages now!

It's a trail of tears, keep home fires burning
We're on a trail of tears, to were dreams go to die

Suffering and dying, enduring the cold
Oppression without regret
Wantonly stealing our land and our gold
The Cherokee will not forget

And all through the nights, we sang and we cried
holding on dearly
Four thousand graves along the way
Who are the savages now!

It's a trail of tears, keep home fires burning
We're on a trail of tears, to were dreams go to die
It's a trail of tears, for our homes we are yearning
We're on a trail of tears, to were dreams go to die
