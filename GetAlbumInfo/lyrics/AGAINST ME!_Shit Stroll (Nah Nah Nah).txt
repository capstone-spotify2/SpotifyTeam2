Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 
Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 

Street lights 
Shed the light of vision to the calling plot 
You remember every moment 
Was there ever a time? 
Or has it always been like this? 
Tonight the bottle offers no answers 
These were the decisions you said you could handle 
This was the moment you said you were ready for 
So the unexpected doesn't appease me 

Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 
Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 

All day I saw around you
Construction of lies 
Tear apart your insides 
They're whispers
Not suggestions
Liar icons 
Too full of sense of direction
Blind, miracle cures 
Offer to sedate the friend of the flesh 
Seizes the benefit 
The words of the charade 
Save our companions
Will there ever be a time? 

Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 
Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh 

Spent a lifetime in order to realize 
What place I did it in 
The material in each and empty thoughts 
The standards of beauty 
Look straight fascist 
Save our social expectations 
Or are you just so far gone to realize
Too close up to understand 
Human nature versus man 
Disorder!
To understand anarchists
Still annoyed by us anarchists 
Sell our shit to all the kids 

Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh
Nah, nah nah nah nah, whoa-oh, ohhh
