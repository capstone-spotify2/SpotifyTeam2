I remember the prison of all memories
And Iâm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I was so crazy all the time I made you cry
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now youâre gone

I try to hide the pain but all I see is you
How can I do it, I donât have a clue
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now youâre gone

I remember the prison of all memories
And Iâm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday you will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I was so crazy all the time I made you cry
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now youâre gone

I try to hide the pain but all I see is you
How can I do it, I donât have a clue
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now youâre gone

I remember the prison of all memories
And Iâm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday you will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the prison of all memories
And Iâm drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday you will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down
