Alright
I feel good
I'm gonna make ya feel like ya should
Ya make me a shakin' sharp shooter but you know I never miss, oh yeah
Now time waits for no one, so take advantage of what you've got
And since time waits for no-one, I think its time that you gimme a shot
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you much more than a walk in the park
Now ya lookin' so tight, I'm gonna make ya feel just right
They're never disappointed 'cause they always come back for me, That's right
Now time waits for no one, so take advantage of what you've got
And since time waits for no-one, I think its time that you gimme a shot
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you much more than a walk in the park, c'mon

<i>[Solo]</i>

You're the best that I've seen
And you lookin' just like a dream
I've had so many girls but you should be on top of the list, Oh yeah
Time waits for no one, so take advantage of what you've got
And since time waits for no-one, I think its time that you gimme a shot
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
I'll give you what every girl wants (I know you want it)
(I know you want it)
(I know you want it)
(I know you want it)
