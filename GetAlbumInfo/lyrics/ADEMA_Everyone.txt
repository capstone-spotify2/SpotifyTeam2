I'm sick of the excuses that you want me to believe
I've been understanding, givin' everything you need
Using me is over now and soon you're gonna see
I'm done with you, I'm done with you

Would there be a difference if I followed what you say?
Taken from my mind and I can't seem to get away
Using me is over now and soon you're gonna see
I'm done with you, I'm done with you

Everyone is the same
Quick to point the blame
All I know is that life is a struggle 
Why, I can't seem to escape all the games that you play
All I know is that life is a struggle 

Sorry, I'm angry, I've fallen from everything
Why am I so angry inside my head
Life's all the same, It's gonna change,
I'm not ashamed to live my life

Everyone is the same
Quick to point the blame
All I know is that life is a struggle 
Why, I can't seem to escape all the games that you play
All I know is that life is a struggle 
<i>[Repeat]</i>

Why am I so angry inside my head
Life's all the same, It's gonna change, I'm not ashamed
