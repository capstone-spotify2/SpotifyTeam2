Ridin' round town, we were young like hope
Small town life really all we'd known
Product of the mountains till the sun came home
Live inside the moments where the sun stayed low
Remember plotting in the parking lot
Plotting just to spark a lot
Someone got a case or two and someone got the handlebar
Someone had a house to go
Someone had a camping spot
We would set up shop around the fire pit below the rocks
Someone brought the table
Someone brought the cups
Someone had the truck with the speakers that could bump
Some of us got lucky
Some of us got drunk
But all of us were lucky, we just didn't know enough

We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life gets
We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life is

She was sitting shot gun
Safety off, we ride or die
Talk is cheap inside a city where they let the money fly
Word get around quicker than the liquor on a Friday night
Parents heard about it for you cut the gas to try to glide
Nights on the run, days on the slopes
A reality shared by all of those I hold close
Trying to get nostalgic, but I'm cruising down the coast
Hard to do it in a place that's so far from home

I know home is where the heart is
The place that taught me we are the artists
Even though home hit it the hardest
Setting goals on an ever moving target
Journey to the top of the mountain peak
To see if outside the valley there was more for me
Funny, back then I couldn't wait to leave
But it's ingrained in my soul like a tread on sneaks

We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life gets
We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life is

Now whenever I go home, I never take it for granted
I take yellow stones over islands made of granite
I take open roads over sitting in your traffic
I take Bob Dylan over most of modern classics
Me, I grew up in the woods, never spent time in the hood
We all got perspectives and this is mine, I go real as I should
Could take you to the places where the wildlife roam
But nowadays it's getting so wild in life that you should go alone
I get reconnected, disconnected from my phone
No compliments or criticism clouding what I know
The river flowing through the canyon influenced my flow
Watched trees rise to the sunny sides, they taught me how to grow

We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life gets
We didn't know, we look back at days like this
We didn't know, the beauty and the thought exists
We didn't know
No we didn't know
How real life is
