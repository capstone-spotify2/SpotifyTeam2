I had a dream just the other night
It looked a lot like you
I saw a painting on the wall
Just like the one you drew
I ate a steak just the other night
It tasted just like you
Felt like a tank in my armour plate
But you could see right through

Words are easy, words are cheap
Wake you up, send you to sleep
Words defend when things get tough
But late at night they are not enough
Oh stay in the game
Oh stay in the game
What's in a name
Send you all insane

I wore a coat just the other day
It felt a lot like you
Emperor's new clothes and baby
You could see right through
So now you want my demon seed
Even though you know
I've been there once before
Sold my soul to rock and roll

Words can cut you to the quick
But that old chestnut Ich Liebe Dich
They only matter put to sound
Grabbed from the air and written down
