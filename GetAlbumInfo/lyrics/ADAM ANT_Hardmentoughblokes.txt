Hard men, tough blokes
You got to laugh when they tell you a joke (ha ha ha ha)
Hard men, tick tock
Step away or they'll beat you up (you up)

Ooh they are the hard men
Ooh they are the tough blokes

McQueen, Tim Roth
Vinnie Jones, you can all fuck off
Winstone, Statham
Don't get in my way, pal

Ooh the hard men
Ooh they are the tough blokes

Ooh they are the one percenters
Ooh they are the one percenters
Ooh they are the one percenters
Ooh they are the one percenters
McQueen, Del Toro
Behave, <i>[?]</i>

Ooh the hard men
Ooh they are the tough blokes

DeNiro, Van Damme
Winstone, Statham
Look away, all fuck off
Look away now before it kicks off

The hard men, the hard men
Ooh they are the hard men
Ooh the tough blokes

Hard men like mucking about
Give you the occasional clout
Don't try to be one of the chaps
You will find yourself on the wrong end of the slaps

'Cos we are the hard men
Ooh we are the tough blokes

Hard Men (hard men), tough blokes (tough blokes)
Hard Men (hard men), tough blokes (tough blokes)
