Thought you saw this last time, it's a rerun.
But this time it's changed you. 
You said you never watched it.
It's your free time.
Image passed, 
Forget your words you live it, 
You live it everyday.
Dead end stare, 
Eyes transfixed focused on destruction, 
Destruction of yourself.
This could be the last time I wait for you.
I wait for...
Take a while,
Things only you can change as you relieve, as you relieve.
Stay awhile,
Things only you can change as you revive,
As you revive yourself, yourself.
This is the last time I didn't belong with you.
It's the last time I played along.
Take a while,
Things only you can change as you relieve, as you relieve.
Stay awhile,
Things only you can change as you revive,
As you revive yourself, yourself.
