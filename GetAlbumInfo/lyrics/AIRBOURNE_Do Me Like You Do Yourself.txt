Alright
I said do me
Alright

I was flipping a record when I heard you next door
I pulled back the curtains
Couldn't believe what I saw, what I saw
The gates of heaven were open wide
Wouldn't be a sin if I came inside
The wolf is at the door so I tried knockin'
But you couldn't hear me, coz the house was rockin'

Your hands are movin' with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex, but you're all alone

Do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself
I say do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself

I was flickin' your doorbell when you buzzed me inside
You said come up the stairwell
I've been waiting all night, all night long
I was late to the dance but not the party
You skipped the romance, started without me
Lying naked on your bed
Doin' it with me in your head

Your hands are movin' with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex, but you're all alone

Do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself
I say do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself

Oh, yeah
Come on
Ooh
Like you do yourself

Do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself
I say do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself

Your hands are movin' with a mind of their own
Havin' the best sex, but you're all alone

Do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself
I say do me like you do yourself
C'mon, do me like you do yourself
Do, do me
Do, do me
Like you do yourself
Do, do me
Like you do yourself
Do, do me
Before I do myself
