Girl I hate to see you cry
Laying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears and listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way that it should
But I know the heart of life is good

Now you know it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
There in the circle of your friends
We'll defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way that it should
But I know the heart of life is good

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who is misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
