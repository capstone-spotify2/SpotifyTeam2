No room for doubt
accusations one to ten,
You've got my number boy
you've got my number boy,
No wasting time
now, you've got me dialed,
I'm one hundred eleven
less than perfection

Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (keep your disease)
sealed lips will not cease the calling (your disease),
Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (no shame)
sealed lips will not cease the calling 

Pathetic eyes
complimenting what's inside,
I've got your number boy
I've got your number boy,
So appalled 
as I watch you purge,
Now see if your fiction
reads salvation

Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (keep your disease)
sealed lips will not cease the calling (your disease),
Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (no shame)
sealed lips will not cease the calling 

No room for doubt
no pity is deserved,
You've got my number boy
you've got my number boy,
Coincidence 
you've assessed correct, 
I'm one hundred eleven
less than perfection

Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (keep your disease)
sealed lips will not cease the calling (your disease),
Pride has faltered now you're left crawling (no shame)
sealed lips will not cease the calling
