<i>[Chorus - Dave:]</i>
And I tried to make you understand that Iâm not sorry
No, Iâm not sorry, baby Iâm not sorry, Iâm not sorry
I dropped my walls, opened locks, let you in
Shared with you all those thoughts about movinâ in
Put all my trust in you while we were a fling
Cause I donât pretend, say it to the end
Iâm not sorry

<i>[Verse 1 - Carter:]</i>
Apologies wonât come from me
Donât believe ya to be someone of a quality
Youâre lower than the European economies
I know what you do when you visit your friends at their colleges
Spittin red cup mythology
And they all eat it up like piranhas see?
Donât acknowledge me anymore
I canât fuck with you
I donât know what to do
You were way too quick to get comfortable
We all know this shits nothing new
Girl iâve done enough for you
And Iâm hardly getting repaid
Many days since we laid
Are now we in fifth grade?
Youâre just afraid

Its a difference of opinion
I think ya wish it was different
But ya kissed him in the kitchen
So i went along and broke it
Sorry i donât wanna continue this intermission
Iâm in the middle of switching to someone more open
You thought i wouldnât notice
But i only focus on what i keep closest
Youâre a plague and i donât need no locusts
Go find out whats at the bottom of the ocean

<i>[Chorus - Dave]</i>

<i>[Verse 2 - Carter:]</i>
Where do we go now?
You know I wile out every time that I go south
Ainât nothin to talk about cuz Iâm on my own now
A situation that I hadda just pull out

I always knew that it wouldnât last
So you can get that tattoo w you own cash
Didnât wanna admit it but youâve got no ass
Itâs hard to get used to someone who moves so fast

So! Youâre dead to me, itâs not destiny
Ya took ecstasy in Chesapeake
You donât needa tell me the rest of it
And know my recipe is excellent
Youâre another notch on my headboard
Donât test me, payback had to be the next thing

Never ever let her get near me again
Oh shit donât hold me back
Peace and quiet you owe me that
Leaving you the loneliest
Girl fall back like the foliage
Ya canât change the past
Youâre never shakin that
I hate ya now, Iâm not sorry
