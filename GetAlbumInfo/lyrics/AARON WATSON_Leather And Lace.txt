I love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
Youâre saying Iâm fragile
I try not to be
I search only
For something
I canât see

I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you wonât be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you wonât be walking out the door

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew Iâd never want to leave
Sometimes Iâm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you light my nights
Somehow Iâd get by

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace
