As I look at this world
You know I'm beginning to see
That this is not the world
That god intended to be

I got to find a new world 
Where the people understand 
How to treat one another
Through out the land

Everybody pack up and go with me

I got to find a new world 
Were the people get along
Where everybody loves each other...

I wanna hear people say... can I help ya
I got to hear people say... come on in
I wanna hear people say... is there anything I can do for you
I got to hear people say... let me help you 

I wanna be able to walk when I wanna
I got to be able to talk when I wanna
I wanna be able to love when I need it ya...
