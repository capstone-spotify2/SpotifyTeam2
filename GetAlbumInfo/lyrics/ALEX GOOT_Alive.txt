Where am I?
Why did I decide to drive this way?
Iâm all alone
Itâs okay the GPS system will guide me home
I just want to go home
(I just want to go home)
I know this isnât the way to drive to jersey
but this is my decision
To go a little further than I usually go
When I drive this road I usually stay at home
(I usually stay at home)

I know thereâs nothing in my head
I think I might be dead
Iâm waiting for a sign to prove Iâm alive
alive and doing well
Iâm living for myself
Iâm taking life one day at a time

I know thereâs nothing in my way
nothingâs stopping me
And nothing can go wrong
On this journey to a place that happens to be
So far away from home
I usually stay at home
I usually stay at home
(I usually stay at home)

I know thereâs nothing in my head
I think I might be dead
Iâm waiting for a sign to prove Iâm alive
Alive and doing well
Iâm living for myself
Iâm taking life one day at a time
One day at a time

I love to leave this town when no one is around
I love to leave this town when no one is around

I know thereâs nothing in my head
I think I might be dead
Iâm waiting for a sign to prove Iâm alive
Alive and doing well
Iâm living for myself
Iâm taking life one day at a time
one day at a time
one day at a time
