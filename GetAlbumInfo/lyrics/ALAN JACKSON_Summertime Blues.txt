Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm a-gonna raise a holler
About a-workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Everytime I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says, "No dice, son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom 'n' papa told me, "Son, you gotta make some money"
"If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well, I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

<i>[key change]</i>
I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well, I called my congressman and he said quote, 
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm a-gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do 
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Yeah, sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do 
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
No there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
