I said, "Cover me, if there is a fire
'cause I want you to burn first"

She screamed at me, "I want to be desired"
I said, "Easy girl, I know it hurts

Let's all give thanks that I am a liar
'cause I got a feeling I just might get worse

Now there's nothing wrong with you I'm just tired
And I'm in a mood for a brand new curse"

You burn first
You burn first
You burn first

"Cover me, if there is a fire
'cause I want you to burn first"

She screamed at me, "I want to be desired"
I said, "Easy girl, I know it hurts

Let's all give thanks that I am a liar
'cause I got a feeling I just might get worse

Now there's nothing wrong with you I've just grown tired
And I'm in a mood for a brand new curse"
