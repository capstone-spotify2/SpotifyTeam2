Like a thief in the night
You should really get arrested
You're so smooth, it's a crime
I was yours in just a second
Didn't know this at all
Till I knew it was gone
But you've done this before
Might be part of your game
But I can't look away
It's too good to ignore!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery
And you should have known better
Then to go and take it all from under me
Cause you stole my attention from the start
From the start, from the start
Ya had my full attention from the start
From the start, from the start

It's not fair to run my mind, I'll admit you've got me blinded
Broke the rules, cross the light, but you know I kinda like it
You don't need a disguise, I don't know where to hide
So just lay down the law, might be part of your game
But I can't look away, is too good to ignore

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery
And you should have known better
Then to go and take it all from under me
Cause you stole my attention from the start
From the start, from the start
Ya had my full attention from the start
From the start, from the start

Uh, uhh, said you should have known better
From the start, start, start!

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery
And you should have known better
Then to go and take it all from under me
Cause you stole my attention from the start
From the start, from the start
Ya had my full attention from the start
From the start, from the start
