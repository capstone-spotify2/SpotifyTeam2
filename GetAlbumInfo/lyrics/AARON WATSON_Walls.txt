Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden 
And then fade away
And if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday 

You got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the dangers
And holds in the pain
Sometimes you're happy
Sometimes you cry
And half of me is ocean
And half of me is sky

'Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

Somethings are over
Somethings go on
Part of me you carry
And part of me is gone

'Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

'Cause you got a  heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down
