Devil's living in my shadow
Watches me every night
Don't know if there's something wrong with me
My better judge was clouded in my mind
Lord love me please
It won't let go of me

He stopped following me
I don't want to hear your whispering
In my ear no more
Just tryna live my life
The way that my mother always wanted me to

But I don't know what's right
Don't know what's wrong
These are the signs that have been here too long

Devil's living in my shadow
It watches me every night
Don't know if there's something wrong with me
My better judge was clouded in my mind

Lord help me please
It won't let go of me
He stopped following me
I don't want to hear your whispering
In my ear no more
Just tryna live my life
The way that my mother always wanted me to

But I don't know what's right
Don't know what's wrong
These are the signs that it's been here too long

Devil's living in my shadow
Watches me every night
Don't know if there's something wrong with me
My better judge was clouded in my mind

Help me
Help me
Help me

He just keeps tapping on my phone line
And it just won't go away
He just keeps tapping on my phone line
And it just won't go away

Just keeps tapping on my phone line
And it just won't go away
Just keeps tapping on my phone line
And it just won't go away

Just keeps tapping on my phone line
And it just won't go away
