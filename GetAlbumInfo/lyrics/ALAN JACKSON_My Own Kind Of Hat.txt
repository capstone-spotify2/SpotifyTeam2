Cowboys and outlaws, right guys and south-paws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lined, and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
'Cause I wear my own kind of hat.

There's two kinds of lovers, two kinds of brothers
Two kinds of babies to hold.
There's two kinds of cherries, two kinds of fairies
Two kinds of mothers I'm told I'm told
