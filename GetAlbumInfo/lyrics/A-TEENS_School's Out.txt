Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin all that noise
Cause they found new toys

Well we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
<i>[Cooper:]</i>
That's a drag

School's out for the summer
School's out forever
I'm bored to pieces

Well we got no class
And we got no principals
And we got no intelligence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

<i>[Cooper:]</i>
Well we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looks
Out for summer
Out till fall
We might not come
Back at all

School's out for summer (detention!)
School's out forever
School's out with fever
School's out completely
School's out for summer
