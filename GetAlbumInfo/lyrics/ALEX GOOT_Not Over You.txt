<i>[Alex Goot:]</i> 
Dreams, that's where I have to go to see your beautiful
Face, anymore I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know, that much is understood
And I realize

<i>[Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza:]</i>
If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say
I'm not over you
Not over you

<i>[Chrissy Costanza:]</i>
Damn, damn boy you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificient
I, I'm a boomerang doesn't matter how you throw me
So turn around, I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
<i>[Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza:]</i>
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doin'
I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and stay that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
<i>[Chrissy Costanza:]</i>
No matter what I say I'm
<i>[Alex Goot:]</i>
No matter what I say I'm
<i>[Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza:]</i>
No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Not over you
