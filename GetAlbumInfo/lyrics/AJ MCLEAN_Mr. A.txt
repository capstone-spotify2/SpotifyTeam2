When I step into the club everybody shouts hooray (a)
Walking down the street they're throwin' me my own parade
And when I close my eyes I see everyone lookin' at me
Don't ask me why never have to try so

Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
Hello, hello
I am Mr. A

They would think that you're insane not to wanna know my name
After lookin' in my eyes you will never be the same, no
What exactly do you think you'll find on the other side
So go ahead and try, 'cause I am that guy so

Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
Hello, hello
I am Mr. A

Lalalalala

Lalalalala

I'm everything, you can't stop me
I look so good
I look so fine
I know you would
You'd cross this line

I am Mr. A
I am Mr. A

Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
Hello, hello
I am Mr. A

I look so good
I look so fine
I know you would
You'd cross this line
