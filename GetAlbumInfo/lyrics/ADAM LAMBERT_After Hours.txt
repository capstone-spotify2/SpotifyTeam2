Gotta get out
Gotta get outside
I gotta get outside of my mind
Before I rip it out
I'm on a drive
I'm on a nightdrive
I gotta take a little trip, get twisted
And ride it out

Always after hours
I'm running red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
Always after hours
I'm running red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel

I'm on drive
I'm on a nightdrive
I gotta get take a little trip, get twisted
And ride it out

Always after hours
I'm running red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
Always after hours
I'm running red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
