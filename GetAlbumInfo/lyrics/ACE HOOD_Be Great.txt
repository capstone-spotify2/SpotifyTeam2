<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
Uh guess again they hesitant
Just to let him in
Walk a mile in my shoes
I swear they never did
Nor they never will
Finally I'm center fielder
See a mill cry tears, for my old fields
Looking back I promise mama that I never will
Gave me chills this humble nigga remaining still
Underrated be the best my ultamatum is in my flow
Cultivate'm, moving like a terminater ugh
So inspired the swagga they so admire
Sitting court side with the Boss with the empires
Used to be a dream I'm a smoking the entire
Moment
R.I.P. My homies
Differnent kind of strokes
For The boy Gary Colemen
Meeting different women
And I swear I gottem open
No love for them because my ice box frozen
Been to the bottom now it's spring like Poland
Wattup 'tho
Renegades we rewritin history
I'm inspired by the beat
Cups for victory

<i>[Hook:]</i>
Hey hey hey hey
And I been through that pain
In my life earning my stripes
But still I'm going fight this war
Cause they say that I won't
Show them I will
You with me let me hear you say
That we never gone stop aim for the top head to that sky
I just wantto be great
Be great be great be great
I just wanna be great
Be great be great be great
I just wanna be

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Hella passinate adamint yes accurate
Science to the game I study like that anatomy
Used to can't battle me now I triple your salary
Back full of batteries that's definition of strategy
Day I let them win homie that'll be death of me
Something you will never see
Dope like methamphetamine
Riding in some shit that probably dropping 2017
Martin Luther ain't the only one who had a dream
I just wanna be great MJ style
Doubted by the critics hiphop's stepchild
Little boy or girl why your head down
You can be great you just got to say it proud
On a mission my ambition got me living different
Big crib but a made man living in it
Words to my niggas they the living witness
Believe that I'm great glad you here to witness
