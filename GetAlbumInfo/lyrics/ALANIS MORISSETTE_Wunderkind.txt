Oh perilous place walk backwards toward you 
Blink disbelieving eyes chilled to the bone 
Most visibly brave no aprehended gloom 
First to take this foot to virgin snow 

I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind oh oh oh oooooh 
And I lift the envelope pushed far enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 

Destined to serve, destined to roam 

Oh ominous place spellbound and unchild-proofed 
My least favorite chill to bare alone 
Compatriots in place they'd cringe if I told you 
Our best back-pocket secret our bond full-blown 

I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind oh oh oh oooooh 
I am a pioneer naive enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 

Destined to seek, destined to know 

Most beautiful place reborn and blown off roof 
My view about-face whether great will be done 

I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind oh oh oh oooooh 
I am a ground-breaker naive enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 

I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind oh oh oh oooooh 
I am a Joan of Arc and smart enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 

Destined to reign, destined to roam 
Destined to reign, destined to roam 
Destined to reign, destined to roam 
Destined to reign, destined to roam
