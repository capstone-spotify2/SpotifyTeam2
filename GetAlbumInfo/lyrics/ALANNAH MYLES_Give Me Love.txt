Uhuh...
Uhuh...
Try a little kindness baby
Show a little empathy
When my eyes are filled with blindness
Try a little sympathy with me

Careful of the things you say with me
If you wanna have your way with me
Whisper in my ear real low but,

Spare Me The Sorrow...
(Give me love and you'll never be sorry, I'd rather be alone than lonely)
Spare Me The Sorrow...
{There's a price to pay for freedom, I wanna know if you are for me}

Uhuh... Uhuh...
Give love and you'll never be sorry
There's a price to pay for freedom
I can smell the morning glory
Will it in your heart and your will be done with me

Careful of the time you spend with me
If you wanna learn to bend with me
You can have your way you know but,

Spare Me The Sorrow...
(Give me love and you'll never be sorry, I'd rather be alone than lonely)
Spare Me The Sorrow...
{There's a price to pay for freedom, I wanna know if you are for me}

O child, comon child, comon' child,
Oh, oh child, comon' child
Oh, oh, oh, comon' child
Oh, oh, c'mon, comon' child
Mmmmm...

I only wanna see you smile
Rather be alone than lonely
I'd rather be, I'd rather be alone than lonely
Ah... with you

(Give me love and you'll never be sorry, I'd rather be alone than lonely)
Spare Me The Sorrow...
(Give me love and you'll never be sorry, I'd rather be alone than lonely)
Spare Me The Sorrow...
(There's a price to pay for freedom, I wanna know if you are for me)
Try a little kindness baby!
