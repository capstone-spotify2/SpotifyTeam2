If you think you're an island
Come and meet your god
To a field where it's buried
Somewhere underground

All good things in time
I know we'll be fine
Buried underneath
You are all I see
You are all I see
You are all I see

All good things in time
I know we'll be fine
Buried underneath
You are all I see
You are all I see
You are all I see
