Her eyes look cold. I see hate. 
This blade sunk deep inside your wrist, 
it's not worth fighting, just resist. 
With a knife, and a thought so sincere. 
Five times the pain so make it last 
donât walk away, donât walk so fast. 

Well I think Iâve lost my mind now, 
I know weâve lost control 
but now weâve got the time.

Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.

You look so good. Those black eyes. 
I know that now Iâve miss the boat, 
and helped in cutting my own throat. 
Iâve found the cure, 
Iâve found whatâs holding us. 
Hold on tightly, oh so dear. 

Well I think Iâve lost my mind now. 
I know weâve lost control 
but now weâve got the time.

Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.

So now whatâs next? 
You let the fire set you free. 
I know youâre already dead, 
but you promised me. 

Lets light this world. 
Weâll meet in the afterlife. 
Lets light this world, 
it's so cold tonight. 

All you need is fire and a friend to wish you well. 
Now wake up from this life.

Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up from this world of ours? 
It's so cold tonight. 
Weâre going nowhere fast. 
Can you wake up? Wake up, 
lets burn this whole place to the ground.
