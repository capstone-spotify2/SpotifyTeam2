The traveller is always leaving town
He never has the time to turn around
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere
He seems to be completely unaware

The traveller is always leaving home
The only kind of life he's ever known
When every moment seems to be
A race against the time
There's always one more mountain left to climb

Days are numbers
Watch the stars
We can only see so far
Someday, you'll know where you are
Remember
Days are numbers
Count the stars
We can only go so far
One day, you'll know where you are

The traveller awaits the morning tide
He doesn't know what's on the other side
But something deep inside of him
Keeps telling him to go
He hasn't found a reason to say no

The traveller is only passing through
He cannot understand your point of view
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find
The traveller in me is close behind

Days are numbers
Watch the stars
We can only see so far
Someday, you'll know where you are
Remember
Days are numbers
Count the stars
We can only go so far
One day, you'll know where you are
