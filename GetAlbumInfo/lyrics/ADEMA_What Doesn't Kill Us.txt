I call you on the phone
I sit here all alone
And try to find the words that I can't say
We waste them thirty days
We'll both be going our separate ways
Now there's nothing we can fall back on

I know i might sound selfish
But I cant, I can't help this

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Nobody knows what I've done (What I've done)
What doesn't kill us makes us (makes us strong)
And there's a place that I know (I don't know)
What doesn't kill us makes us (makes us strong)

There's nothing left for me
But paybacks deaf and next to me
When did I go wrong I don't know
I gotta leave and take what's time
Wasted youth and wasted time
Carve these into my stem so they will show

I know i might sound selfish
But I cant, I can't help this

<i>[Chorus]</i>

So give back everything you took from me
Don't believe in me
You don't care about me
I've had my lesson it set me free
Don't believe in me
You don't care about me

No

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Makes us
Makes us
Makes us
Makes us
