I toss and turn and lie awake...it torments me, I must know why
It just seems too easy...what is beyond that door?
As I take a step back I wonder could I go on and turn the key?

Look away! Turn away!
I should remember nothing is what it seems
For once in my life I will resist...temptation has
Come alive again!
When all is said and done I may not be able to move on
If I don't know what lies beyond
Desire is now the one in control
Am I strong enough to not ever know just what I'd find?
Should I press on?

I can almost hear anguished cries as they suffer
Welcome to the bodies!
I should run...
I should run but I just can't seem to move

Look away! Turn away!
I should remember nothing is what it seems
For once in my life I will resist...temptation has
Come alive again!
When all is said and done I may not be able to move on
If I don't know what lies beyond
Desire is now the one in control
Am I strong enough to not ever know just what I'd find?
What sinful trance awaits me as the key turns?

Now it is done...the key has been turned
All that is left is my embrace
Her trembling is driving me wild!
Her shrieks are so intoxicating!
Eyes filled with tears will strain to see
Welcome home! I am your prison!
