Nice try - if you wanna get me down
You gotta shoot me twice

Watch out - you better move aside
And try to realize - that I'm alive

Why me - can't you see
You're nothing I wanna be

Back off - you should be aware
diggin' in the dirt - isn't fair
What do you want from me
What are you trying to say

Stop diggin' in the dirt
.... diggin' in the dirt
Stop diggin' in the dirt
.... diggin' in the dirt

Gar lost - if you gotta dig in dirt
Just try your own

Calm dawn - it's making me sick
Right to the bone - we're nor alike

What do you want from me
What are you trying to say
Stop diggin' in the dirt
.... diggin' in the dirt
Stop diggin' in the dirt
.... diggin' in the dirt
