When all else fails and you have nothing
You know you really should believe in something
Take a look at what you have
To a dream that's not all that bad
Don't waste time with all your thinking
Wake up now your dreams are sinking
Making the change is up to you
You'll accept nothing less than the best

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Come, come, come on
Bring out the magic
Come, come, come on
bring out the magic

It's much quicker than the eye
It's your mind and it's there all the time
Say good-bye this is tomorrow
Make your mind up not to follow

You can lead yourself away
Understand, you can have what you say

<i>[Chorus]</i>

You can lead yourself away
Understand, you can have what you say

You can stay with me now
And tell me what you know
You can stay with me now
And tell me all you know

<i>[Chorus]</i>

You can lead yourself away
Understand, you can have what you say

<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
