There's a bottle, on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty, so right now I don't feel a thing
But I'll be hurtin', when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon

That's the difference between whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness, well that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do

That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder, if they ain't both the same
And one's a liar, that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's a long gone bitter truth

That's the difference between whiskey and you

I've got a problem, but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome, an' I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down, and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue

That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder, if they ain't both the same
And one's a liar, that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's a long gone bitter truth

That's the difference, between whiskey and you
Oh, that's the difference, between whiskey and you
