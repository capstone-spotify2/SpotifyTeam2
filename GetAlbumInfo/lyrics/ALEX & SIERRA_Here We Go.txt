Drinking in the water
Looking at the wild attire
Sitting by the benches
Like a desert wildflower

Tell me now, tell me now
What you want, what you want
Tell me now, tell me now
Don't stop, don't stop

Come closer
Let me lay with all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of rhyme and reason

Oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go

Silhouettes in dust clouds
Revelate in consummation
Nothing's ever too loud
When you don't need conversation

Tell me now, tell me now
What you want, what you want
Tell me now, tell me now
Don't stop, don't stop

Come closer
Let me lay with all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of rhyme and reason

Oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go

Oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
Oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone

Come closer
Let me lay with all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of rhyme and reason

Oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone

Come closer
Let me lay with all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of rhyme and reason

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're never better off alone
You're never better off alone
