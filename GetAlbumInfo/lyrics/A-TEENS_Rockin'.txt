We are leavin' it behind now
We've been tryin' to get this through to you
We've been waitin' for a long time
We've been watchin' your every move

I see your picture in the paper
I see you smilin' on the TV
Baby you gotta know it's for real
And you better quit what you're doin' and look out for us

We're gonna keep on rockin' all through the night
We're comin' out to watch the world pass us by
And we'll be stayin' here for a while
Coz' we'll be rockin' til' the end of time

We are miles away from nowhere
We've been walking down this same old road again
As the raindrops fall down on me
Oh why can't you see
I wanna be the one for you

I see your picture in the paper
I see you smilin' on the TV
Baby you gotta know it's for real
And you better quit what you're doin' and look out for us

We're gonna keep on rockin' all through the night
We're comin' out to watch the world pass us by
And we'll be stayin' here for a while
Coz' we'll be rockin' til' the end of time

If you want my heart I'll give it to you
If you want my soul
There's no problem to give
cuz as long as I live
I will always keep on rockin' for you
