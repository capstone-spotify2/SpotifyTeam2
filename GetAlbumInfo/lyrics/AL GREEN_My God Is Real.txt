There are some things
I may not know
There are some places
Oh lord, I cannot go

But I am sure
Of this one thing
That god is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Yes, God is real
Oh, he's real in my soul
Yes, god is real
For he has a washed
And made me whole

His love for me
Is just like pure gold, oh lord
My god is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Yes, god is real
Oh yes, god is real in my soul
Yes, god is real
For he has washed
And made me whole

His love for me
You know its just like pure gold
Oh yes

Yes, god is real for I can feel
Him in my soul
