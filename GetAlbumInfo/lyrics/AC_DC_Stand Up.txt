Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on the midnight, escapade
I didn't wanna steal your thunder
I wouldn't wanna play your game
Making all the headlines, getting on the front page

Didn't even know her number, didn't even know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel, and a pretty face
Woman wanna get you under
Woman wanna get you tame
Loving on a hot night
Stoking up the flame

I didn't wanna know her number, I didn't wanna know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

You can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, you can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, stand up
