To loose pay the price,

You had the best intention.
Leaving me with lonely, lonely
And I'm just sittin' missing you,
Down and out, needing you only, only.

There's a place for you inside my heart
Open a space for you inside my heart.
There's room for you to move in
We don't have to be apart
There's a place for you inside my heart

There's a place for you inside my heart
Open a space for you inside my heart.
There's room for you to move in
We don't have to be apart
There's a place for you inside my heart

There's a place
