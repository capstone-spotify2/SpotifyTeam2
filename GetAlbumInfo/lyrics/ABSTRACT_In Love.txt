Baby take my hand (take my hand)
I promise that you won't be alone
I never let you go
Baby understand (understand)
Baby that I'm love with you
And I had to let you know
Let you know
Let you know
Let you know

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
Brightest star in my sky
Get to see you every morning for the sunrise
I've been down for the count cause the stress amounts
But you keep me on my grind when I have my doubts
No we're thinking bout moving out the grey skies
Get us skies, looking sunny it's about time
I was dark as the city when I moved here
But you got me Skywalking like the force here
And I know they say home is where the heart is
And you got mine, Cupid got his target
That's a hell of a shot
I ain't too easy to lack
I've been cursed with ambition, my mission all for the top
I'd rather get it with you, rather we both on the move
Put your hands on the ladder
I'll bring you up for the view
You got me happier than words can ever say
Know you love it when I sing so I wrote this anyway, so

<i>[Abstract:]</i>
Know me like a best friend (best friend)
And you love me like a deity (deity)
Keep me humble as a hater (hater)
When my ego get ahead of me (you know)
But what would I do without you? (I don't know)
Probably searching round the world to find you (that's true)
You were riding for me before I had a clue
Way before the hype, way before I had the crew
Way before the team was worldwide, saw me as the truth
Now it's LA for the week
Mobbin' right beside you
Ocean Ave. to the Boulevard
Using any yellow card
I don't think you know how beautiful that you really are
Journey ahead of us, something new to us both
But I got money on us and I girl I'm going for broke
You got your hands on my heart, I pledge allegiance to that
We got a world to take on
I'm ready for that
