God blessed our love
Even in the mornin' when I rise
I say, God blessed our love

And every mornin' when I rise
I can just see heaven <i>[?]</i> your eyes
It makes me know this is not an everyday love, no, no
We've got something, I'm sure we can be proud of

Oh, we've got so much, show much love
We've got so much, so much trust
Can't you see a halo, a halo?
I can see a halo hovering over us

And oh, I didn't meant it, baby
But God, blessed our love
I have to say it, <i>[?]</i> that
God, oh God, blessed our love

If you've got something to be thankful for
You oughtta just say, hey
God, blessed our love
I'll have to say this evenin'

God, oh God, blessed our love
I swear he did
Let me say, I could just stand up
And tell the world, oh babe

That you're mine, all mine, all mine
Your love is heavenly, desirable
And I just have to say, I like kissin' you
I like, I like, huggin' you

I like squeezin' you, wanting you
Holding you, loving you
I'm glad, I'm still lovin' you, come on, baby

Let me say that when people, yeah
People yeah start to criticize, it don't bother me
No, no, 'cause I know God, God
God is on our side

You see and let me just say that
God, God blessed our love
I have to say that, God, blessed our love
