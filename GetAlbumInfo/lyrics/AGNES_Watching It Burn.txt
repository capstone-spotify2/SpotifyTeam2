I've seen this coming for a long time
The silence in the conversations
Saying more than feel safe out loud

There was a time I would've fought you
To save this love but now it's pointless
Standing like strangers in the crowd

Watching it burn
And I am helpless now to stop it
Watching it burn
Looks like the whole world's crashing down

Thought we were in it for the long run
That we were built to last in sadder
Coal fire is prudently long

I feel it growing from the inside
Why should we stay and wait forever?
Knowing what is coming along

Watching it burn
And I am helpless now to stop it
Watching it burn
Looks like the whole world's crashing down

Watching it burn
And I am helpless now to stop it
Watching it burn
Don't wanna see it burn

Don't wanna see it burn,
Don't wanna see it burn
Don't wanna see it burn

Watching it burn
And I am helpless now to stop it
Watching it burn
Looks like the whole world's crashing down

Watching it burn
And I am helpless now to stop it
Watching it burn
Don't wanna see it burn
Don't wanna see it burn
