Thereâs something beautiful in my eyes stormy skies
Donât you leave before your time is up
I canât let you leave me

What weâve been through me and you
Youâll be fine just say its true
I hate to see you panic helplessly

âCause I received your message for me
It was written on your face
You said âlive your life and do whatâs right for youâ (for you)
And I can not forget your smiling face
âCause I think I found hope in your embrace

It seems when I lose touch with my life
I can find peace and comfort knowing I
Somehow see success with your advice

Even though you could not speak
Words in a language known to me
You spoke your deepest thoughts effectively

âCause I received your message for me
It was written on your face
You said âlive your life and do whatâs right for youâ (for you)
And I can not forget your smiling face
âCause I think I found hope in your embrace

Youâll always be there for me
You exist in my heart
My mind reminds me that itâs been too long
Too long since youâve come around
I miss you every day
But I canât let my thoughts be bringing me down (again)

âCause I received your message for me
It was written on your face
You said âlive your life and do whatâs right for youâ (for you)
And I can not forget your smiling face
âCause I think I found hope in your embrace
