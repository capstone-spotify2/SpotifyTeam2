Girl, just take some time
Let me try to find the words I wanna say to you
I been searchin' my mind
I got to find the reasons I feel the way I do
Let me emphasize that I recognize
What I should and should not do
And though I know it's wrong
Every now and then I phone
Just to talk to you

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose

Sometimes you cross my mind
And I don't know why
But I hear from you
And though I want to stay close
I realize the most we'll ever be is good friends
I got kids at home
I can't leave them alone
This I'm telling you
I've got another life
'Cause I still love my wife
Though I still want you

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose
Even when you trust your heart

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose
