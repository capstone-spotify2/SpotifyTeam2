when I'm in heat and someone gets a notion 
I jump to my feet, I hoof it to the ocean 
we hit a beach where no one give a hoot 
nobody never ever wears a suit 
the ladies there, they look so proud 
that's cause they know that their well endowed 
I ain't much on Fannie's conversation 
or care to much about her operation 
but every time Pandora come my way 
I get high, can't explain the sensation 
to get it on I got to watch what I say 
or I'll catch hell from the women's liberation 
sweet Pandora 
godlike aura 
smellin' like a flora 
open up your door-a for me 
sweet Pandora 
mama crack a smile for me 
just for me 
now I ain't what you'd call a city slicker 
or claim to fame to be a slitty licker
