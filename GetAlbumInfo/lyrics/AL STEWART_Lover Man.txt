Baby come tell me 'bout your tree-house
And your candy-strped pet mouse
And your car that has feet
Hey come tell me 'bout your eyebrows that meet
And my baby won't you tell me 'bout your chilblains
And your right eyeball's growing pains
And your purple tractor that sings
Hey come tell me all of those things

But if you want to tell me some more
Think you can
Oh babe tell me 'bout your lover man

You know I'm talking 'bout him
He's one that's strutting around
Each time I get out of town
You know the one that I mean
He's one that's stealing my scene away
Baby I'm talking 'bout him

Oh baby won't you tell me 'bout your black rose
And the garden where your love grows
Among the cabbages and beans
Hey come tell me why your primroses are green

But if you want to tell me some more
Think you can
Oh babe tell me 'bout your lover man

You know I'm talking 'bout him
He's one that's strutting around
Each time I get out of town
You know the one that I mean
He's one that's stealing my scene away
Baby I'm talking 'bout him
He's one that's stealing my cream away
Baby I'm talking 'bout him
Talking 'bout your lover man
Talking 'bout him
