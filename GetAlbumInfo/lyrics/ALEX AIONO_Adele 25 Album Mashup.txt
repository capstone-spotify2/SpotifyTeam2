I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
Oh remedy

I'm giving you up
I've forgotten it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

Send my love to your new lover
Treat him better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Oh
Tell me our love ain't water under the bridge
Oh
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless

You look like a movie
It sounds like a song
Oh it sounds like a song

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
'Cause I've forgotten it all
But I'll still be
Remedy
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
