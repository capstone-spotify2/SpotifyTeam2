Excuse me,
Ma'am can you help me.
I need to place an ad with you today.

No ma'am,
tomorrow may be too late.
I'd like to have it started right away.

What's that.
No this is personal.
I'm not buying or selling anything.
Yes ma'am.
I know just what to say.
I wrote it down,
This is how it should read.

Wanted!
One good hearted woman
to forgive inperfections
in the man that she loves.

Wanted!
Just one chance to tell her
how much he still loves her
he can't be sorry enough.

What's that.
No that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her.
Yes ma'am.
She means everything.
I hope she comes back
When she reads these words.

Wanted!
One good hearted woman
to forgive inperfections
in the man that she loves.

Wanted!
Just one chance to tell her
how much he still loves her
he can't be sorry enough.
