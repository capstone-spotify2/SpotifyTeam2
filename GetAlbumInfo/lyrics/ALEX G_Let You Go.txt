Tell me what are you scared of
Isn't it me you're looking for
And tell me why you're waiting
Isn't love standing at your door
I'm wasting precious time
Waiting patiently for you
So tell me what are you scared of

And maybe I should let you go
Maybe I'm scared to know anything else
So could you try to come undone just this once
And baby please let me know so I can let this go

See me, I'm beside you
I'll be here for all you need
But baby I'm behind you
You're just dragging me along
You're dragging me along
And I'd be better off if you'd just let me move on

And maybe I should let you go
Maybe I'm scared to know anything else
So could you try to come undone just this once
And baby please let me know so I can let this go

And it feels so cold
Watching this love grow
Alone and it hurts because I know
What it's like to hold you, my love
You, my love
So let me know
'Cause love should never leave someone this cold

Maybe I should let you go
And maybe I'm scared to know anything else
So could you try to come undone just this once
And baby please let me know, ohhh

Maybe I should let you go
Maybe I'm scared to know anything else
So could you try to come undone just this once
And baby please let me know 'cause I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
