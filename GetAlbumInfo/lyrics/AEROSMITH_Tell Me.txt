I think it's time to realize it's done
I guess I have to accept it
I was never the one
Yeaaah, it was so good
I thought I fell into someone else's dream
Yeah, but I let it be mine, thought you let it be yours
No nothing's ever what it seems

I thought I felt it all around
But now it's lying there on the ground
Why was it there for me,
But not for you?

Tell me, tell me,
Becomes be so long,
Now I'm sittin' here
And you're so far gone

I'm staring down at the page in a magazine
I looked up at the TV, but it's just an empty screen
When we're together, I thought it was ecstasy
Oh I can tell the sun's still shining
But shadows are all I can see

And everywhere I go,
I'll never see a face I know
What could I say,
That could make you come back this way

Tell me, tell me,
Becomes be so long,
Now I'm sittin' here
And you're so far gone

Now I know I should have known
And I see I could have seen
You gotta restless soul
Need to know, I want to find out
If your fields are still green
(Whoaaa)

Now I hope that what I have found
Could somehow be true
Why is it such a long long way and you
Tell me, tell me
Becomes be so long,
Now I'm sittin' here
And you're so far gone
