There's somethin' that
I've got to say
You're always with me
Even though, you're far away
Talkin to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice
Makes my heart melt
Oh girl, well it's true

I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love

And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you

I know you worry sometimes,
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world
That anyone could take the
Place of my number one girl

It's true
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love

And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to

Oh girl, I'm all about you
When i close my eyes i can see you
It's like your right here
And this feeling's only gettin' stronger
You're with me everywhere

I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have 
To question my love

And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are goin' out to

Oh girl, I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you....
