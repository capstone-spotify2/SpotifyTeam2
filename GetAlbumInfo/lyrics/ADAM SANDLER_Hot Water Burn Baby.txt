<i>[Wife:]</i> Okay, honey!

<i>[TV:]</i> The villagers of Pasquan
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Pasquan
<i>[TV:]</i> have a very bizarre and painful way of welcoming their infants into the community.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> <i>[garbled]</i>
<i>[TV:]</i> Unfortunately, the death rate from this ritual is a mortifying 90 percent.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> My God.
<i>[TV:]</i> That explains the Pasquan's low population.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Yeah, it does.
<i>[TV:]</i> On the first full moon of Autumn, all the Pasquanian mothers wrap their new-borns in traditional hand painted deerskin,...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Deerskin.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...which have been passed along from generation to generation.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> That's nice.
<i>[TV:]</i> The entire Pasquan population then forms a circle on the sacred battlefield of Chin-Chara.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> ya-yara
<i>[TV:]</i> Each Pasquanian baby is then passed, hand to hand, around the circle...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Wow.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...four times.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Four times.
<i>[TV:]</i> Once for the sun,...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> Hmm.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...once for the moon,...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> The moon.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...once for the earth,...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> The earth.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...and once for the wind.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> The wind, too.
<i>[TV:]</i> When the babies arrive back in their mother's hands, they are marched, in procession, to the Pasquanian natural hot springs...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> What?
<i>[TV:]</i> ...where the ceremonial purification will be completed.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> What are you saying here?
<i>[TV:]</i> As we watch, the mothers take their progeny out of the deerskin shells...
<i>[Ryan:]</i> No.
<i>[TV:]</i> ...and dunk them into the steaming water.
<i>[Ryan:]</i> No! No! Hot water burn baby! Hot water burn baby!
