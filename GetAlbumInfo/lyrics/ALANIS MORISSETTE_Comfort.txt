We spent our days in contemplation
Too much too soon
and though it hurts to let it linger on and on
You're all I need

What will my heart allow
When loneliness holds me down

So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
But I guess you can't come out for a while

We spent our nights in conversation
Too much to prove
And I've been a fool to let it linger on and on
You're all I see

Shaping our love we found
impossible higher ground

So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I guess you can't come out for a while
Won't you move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I've come to learn how love can cage you
tear you up then try to replace you
I guess I won't come out for a while
With no warning, no pause, no pity

Why-y -- why-why-y-y

Don't wake awake my soul anymore
Just stay away from me a little while
Where will you go when we walk away

oooo-oooh -- ooo-ohh

My only comfort is gone
With no warning, no pause, no pity
