In another time and place Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my Grandpa's lap I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around the leaves of fall had fallen down
Those fields were bare and brown and they were gone, long gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring we're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet so make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

There's so much I can't explain such as gravity and pain
Still I remain blind folded and full of faith
I kiss my angel girl goodbye, still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So hold âem tender and hold 'em tight, pray every morning day and night
God will help you raise them right and don't you blink, don't blink

'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring we're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet so make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

Life can be filled full sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could be the day

Like bluebonnets in the spring we're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet so make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

Life is like bluebonnets in the spring
