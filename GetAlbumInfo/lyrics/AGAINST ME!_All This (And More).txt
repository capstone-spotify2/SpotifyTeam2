160 miles to Cincinnati,
Plastic Christ, my heart's breaking in my chest.
160 miles to regret.
Shimmy for me in this hotel bed.
Spiral out and spiral down,
I remember how you first endeared yourself to me.

All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget

I wanna believe what you're snaking to me
With your hushed breath in my ear, your hips in my hands,
French girls from Jacksonville, as nihilistic as you might expect.
I somehow ended up missing your kind of crazy more than the rest.

All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget
All this and more to forget you
All this and more to forget
