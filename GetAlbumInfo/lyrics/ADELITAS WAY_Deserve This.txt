I call you a fool and you deny it,
And stick to your storyline,
'Cause every second I keep praying,
For your choke to come,
But you can't word this,
You try to act like I, can,

Call me yourselve's descending,
Don't try to act like I deserve this,
Your plan is ending,
Don't try and act like I,
Don't act like I deserve this,

'Cause every moment that I keep awaitin',
For your choke to shine,
But you can't word this,
You try to act like I, can,

Call me yourselve's descending,
Don't try to act like I deserve this,
Your plan is ending,
Don't try and act like I,
Don't act like I deserve this,

You keep crawling around,
In time,
They say you need it when you can,
You keep crawling around,
In time,
Don't try to act like I,

Call me yourselve's descending,
Call me yourselve's descending,
Don't try to act like I deserve this,
Your plan is ending,
Don't try and act like I,
Don't act like I deserve this,
Earn this,
You try and act like I deserve this,
Earn this,
Don't try and act like I deserve this,
Earn this,
Don't try and act like I,
Don't try and act like I deserve this.
