Well sooner 
or later
It's all coming down
I float 
down a river
Above my own town
I will fight fire with fire
I will take an eye for every eye
I've got my finger on the trigger
I've got you in my sight

Well sooner 
or later
It's all coming down
And high 
above the city
I ride the wave down

And you won't be stopped till you crush me
And you won't be stopped till you kill us all
But I've got the ultimate weapon
I'm sick of dangling question marks

Well I've got my ducks in a row
Got my head on straight
Cause I know what's love
When the universe breaks my heart
Sooner or later it all comes out in the end
For now hell is all the people 
cause the devil said so
