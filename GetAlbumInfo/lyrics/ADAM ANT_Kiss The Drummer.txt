In for a penny in, for a pound
If she walks by you, you better turn around
She wants sparkle and she don't give a damn
As well be hung for
A sheep than a lamb

So be her Daddy
She hits back
Kiss the drummer
Rat-a-tat-tat

Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Miss Fierce kiss the drummer

Little by little, bit by bit
Love stood laughing at this locksmith
She may be wrong, and she may be right
But barking dogs they
Seldom bite

So be her Daddy
She hits back
Kiss the drummer
Rat-a-tat-tat

Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Laugh and enjoy herself
Got to learn to laugh at this
Miss Fierce kiss the drummer

In the panic and the traumas
Miss Fierce puts on her
Fierce legwarmers

When men think big
And by golly they do
They don't wanna go crying
Boo-hooing at you

When men think big
And by golly they do
They don't wanna go crying
Boo-hooing at you
