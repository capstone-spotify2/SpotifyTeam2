There lies a tavern down Wisconsin Way
Where you can get drunk any time of the day
The landlord's a bastard, the barmaid's a whore
But give them no shit or you're straight out the door

The Sunk'n Norwegian's the name of this hole
A nasty ol' tavern if ever I've known

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink before we have to die
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink, before we have to die
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Scoundrels and brigands and ne'er-do-wells
And creatures dragged up from the black pits of hell
You'll find the relief in a tankard of ale
So the Sunk'n Norwegian is where we will sail

For barrels of whiskey or pints from the bar
But if you don't know
Then you don't go

Drink up my friends, as much as you can
For tomorrow we sail to a faraway land
We'll party all night and get drunk off our heads
'Cause we can all rest when we are dead

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
