Take me home
The world is slightly colder now
Both of us are past our better days

Take my hand
And I will give myself to you
Pushing everything out of our way

Thereâs so much time but not enough for you and me to know
Weâll always find each other in the end
So for tonight, letâs sing about the ones we left behind
And Iâll run with you until weâre dead and gone

Hold me close
The bed is folded gently now
Iâm leaving it to time to do the rest

One last word
Before I leave your memories
Donât be sad cos I know I wonât be

Thereâs so much time but not enough for you and me to know
Weâll always find each other in the end
So for tonight, letâs sing about the ones we left behind
And Iâll run with you until weâre dead and gone

Thereâs so much time but not enough for you and me to know
Weâll always find each other in the end
So for tonight, letâs sing about the ones we left behind
And Iâll run with you until weâre dead and gone
