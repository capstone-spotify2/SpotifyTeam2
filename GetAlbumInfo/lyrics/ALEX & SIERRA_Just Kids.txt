Floating on while the world is sinking
Umbrellas in the the cups, we're drinking
I love it, lo-lo-love it
Love it, lo-lo-love it

We light it up in the darkest hour
Our dreams only getting louder
I love it, lo-lo-love it
Love it, lo-lo-love it

This is our turn now
Nothing left to think about
Baby, let your hair down
(I love it, lo-lo-love it)
Down, down, down
(Love it, lo-lo-love it)

These are our last words
Gonna be the last ones heard
Baby, when we crash and burn
(I love it, lo-lo-love it)
Burn, burn, burn
(Love it, lo-lo-love it)

We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
<i>[x2]</i>

We're just la la la la la la...
La la la la la la...

I shouldn't tell you that I see through your dress
Ain't no shame in a drunken secret
I love it, lo-lo-love it
Love it, lo-lo-love it

Little lady, come a little closer now
You can see me while the stars are falling down
I love it, lo-lo-love it
Love it, lo-lo-love it

This is our turn now
Nothing left to think about
Baby, let your hair down
(I love it, lo-lo-love it)
Down, down, down
(Love it, lo-lo-love it)

These are our last words
Gonna be the last ones heard
Baby, when we crash and burn
(I love it, lo-lo-love it)
Burn, burn, burn
(Love it, lo-lo-love it)

We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
<i>[x2]</i>

We're just la la la la la la...
La la la la la la...

Nights are red, days are gold
The sun goes out, moon is full
Just us kids letting go
Just us kids letting go
<i>[x2]</i>

We're just kids setting stuff on fire
We are, we are, we are
(Just us kids letting go)
We are, we are, we are
(Just us kids letting go)
<i>[x2]</i>

We're just kids
