She was a danger
Ain't no stranger
You give me rock n roll
Around the town
Just foolin' around

She's gonna break ya
Wanna make ya
Gonna make it
Wanna take it down
She's gonna rock n roll and slide it down

Wheels
Spinnin' around my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red

She wanna shake you
No way to save you
She got me shot, I'm fallin'
I'm blowin' it out
Know what I'm talking about

She gonna ride you
Wanna slide you
Ain't no fakin'
She wanna take you out
You betcha right
She's gonna spin you 'round

Wheels
Spinnin' around my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red
Wheels
Goin' down the road
Ready to explode
Wheels
Burnin' down the road
Hitting overload

Wheels
Spinnin' around my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red
Wheels
Flyin' down the road
Ready to explode
Wheels
Burnin' up the road
Hitting overload
Wheels
Hitting overload
Wheels
Ready to explode
