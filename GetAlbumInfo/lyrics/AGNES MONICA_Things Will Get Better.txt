I'm the one that's always been here
Even through the darkest nights
And brave the tide
For you and me

All I ever needed was you
You never have the worry at all
What happened to us
What happened to love

Every step seems just a little better
Your mistakes don't really seem to matter
I want that going OK.
As long as I got you and you got me

I've been saying to myself be stronger
Like work it out; it's gonna take a little bit longer
As long as I got you, you got me, you say
Things will get better

A mirrors now would've been so clear
Every shadow like a broken glass
Can we mend the past
With me and you

Maybe I should face the truth
I need you to be what I know you can be
Don't give up on us
Don't give up on love

Every step seems just a little better
Your mistakes don't really seem to matter
I want that going OK
As long as I got you, and you got me

I've been saying to myself be stronger
Like work it out; it's gonna take a little bit longer
As long as I got you, you got me, you say
Things will get better

Oh yeah yeah
Hmm yeah
Uhmmm mmm

Things will get better
