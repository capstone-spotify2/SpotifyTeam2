1971, we all heard the starters gun 
New York is such a pity 
But at Max's Kansas City we won 

We all shot the shit at the bar 
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar 
And then old Clive Davis said 
He's surely gonna make us a star 
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are 

But with all his style 
I could see in his eyes 
That we is goin' on trial 
And it was no surprize 

The boys kept kickin' ass 
As usual time would tell 
But some bitch in the choir 
Throw water on the fires of hell 
She loved to show and tell 
Lord, she loved to tell 

But with all our style 
You could see in our eyes 
That we is still on trial 
And it was no surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 

Midnight lady 
Situation fetal 
Vaccinate your ass with your phonograph needle 

I say looky here 
Friend of mine 
You scratch like you need calamine 
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin' 
Still in love and Puerto Rican too 

Ridin' on wheels of hell 
Smokin' our axle grease 
Oh, the backstage is rockin' 
And we're coppin' from the local police 
That's right, the local police 
Or the juctice of peace 

But with all our style 
You could see in our eyes 
That we is still on trial 
Baby, it's no surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 

Rock n' roll, junkie whore 
Got my foot inside the door 
Knock knock, knock knock, knock 
Nobody's keepin' score 

Bad times go away 
Come again some other day 
Topaz and sazzafraz 
Will keep the blues away 

Candy store, rock n' roll 
Corporation jellyroll 
Play the singles, it ain't me 
It's programmed insanity 

You ASCAP, if BMI 
Could ever make a mountain fly 
If Japanese can boil teas 
Then where the fuck's my royalties...aar
Yak yak yak yak 'oow
