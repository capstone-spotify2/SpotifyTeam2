Every night devise
new heights in genocide.
Lover I am loveless.

All my friends and I
toast health and suicide.
Lover, I am lonely.

Come on!

Were you holding hands when
my palms bled?

Oh, I will be alright...
just use me, just use me.
The future's bright without me.
Spend some time walking the line.

World is unified.
Ennui, and I divide.
Lover, I am loveless.

Red days and burning might bleed
'Til the faceless die
Oh, lover I am lonely.

Were you holding hands when
my wrists bled?

Oh I will be all right...
Just use me, just use me.
The futures bright without me
Spend some time walking the line.
Spend some time walking the line.

So stay sweetly numb.
Remain lifeless, love.
Stay sweetly numb.
Maintain lifeless love.

Stay sweetly numb.
Remain lifeless love.

Oh I will be all right...
Just use me, just use me.
The futures bright without me
Spend some time walking the line.
Spend some time walking the line.
