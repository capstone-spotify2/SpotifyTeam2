Just when ya thought it was safe

Shake it
Shake it
Shake it

When I hit town
Yo, the party can't fail
I'm hittin' 20
On the rictor scale
Got a hundred million people
Spilling coffee stains
On your brand new shirt
Oh, that reminds me
When you feel your gums flap
It's Aaron's rap
Watch yourself
I'ma rearrange your map
Do your hands shake, baby
You ain't getting old
It's only Aaron Carter here
To rock and roll

Where ever I go
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

Wherever I go
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali yell
Not another earthquake
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down

When I drove by
I'ma shake the foundation
Rock the formation
What's your reservation
Photos hang up the walls
It's amazing, oh no
Trouble with the bass vibration
Race the impact
Of my new track
Take cover cause
We're coming through like that
All the other
Tracks are wickie wickie whack
Its 2 double 0 2, time to react
From the east, to the west
To the north, to the south

Where ever I go
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the shots at the girls I
Make, make, make
Drop it down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go

Wherever I go
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people that are jealous say
Not another earthquake
Drop it down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
