Run on up, run on down
Be a step ahead in time
Don't you stop to look in his eyes
He wants your soul, he wants your mind

He'll tear you apart
He'll rip you asunder
Stretch your mind, so look out

Hearts must break, hearts must bleed
When you heed the demon's call
Death is near, light is the speed
Flashing out "just kill them all"

Eat out your heart
Dark master  of thunder
Lord of darkness and doubt

Run if you can, shake off the devil
Man, don't you pay with your life
Run if you can, deadly and evil
He's hell on earth and he's alive

Ooh, when it is all over
You've surrendered to the night
Out of the day, knowning no way
Deadly is the demon's night

All you know
Is a real world, real men
Love - what they need, it's gone

Run if you can, shake off the devil
Man, don't you pay with your life
Run if you can, deadly and evil
He's hell on earth and he's alive

Hearts must break, hearts must bleed
When you heed the demon's call
Death is near, light is the speed
Flashing out "just kill them all"

Eat out your heart
Dark master  of thunder
Lord of darkness and doubt

Run if you can, shake off the devil
Man, don't you pay with your life
Run if you can, deadly and evil
He's hell on earth and he's alive

And he's alive

Run ...
