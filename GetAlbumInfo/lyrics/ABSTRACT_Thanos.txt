Used to reach for the voice
Fiend for the spot
Fiend for the noise
Fiend for the top
Do the impossible then never stop
Take the opposition, make em listen
'Till I'm chilling with the illest
Say it take a village but it took the world
Checkers with the game I been moving across the board
King me when I get there I'm saying lord
I swear I knew to use my voice for good
Speak of a mindset that everyone should
Just be myself and knew everyone would
I knew that they would
Relate to a common man
But what I've become is uncommon man
Most lie 'bout my kinda accomplishments
But I can't lie to y'all I want more than this

I'm Thanos with that gauntlet powers infinite
Just be happy that the kid ain't been abusing it
I'm a hero or a villain I still can't decide
Feel like every single thought I been switching sides

Power, drunk off the power
I think it's clouding my vision
Power, drunk off the power
Look at the voice I been given
Power, drunk off the power
Stop poppin' bottles of that
Stop tripping on tracks
Let's celebrate for the night
Let's celebrate where we at

This me cementin' my place
This me with no time to waste
Singing too much y'all forgot I could rap
Gossip too much y'all forgot where I'm at
Knew the levels, knew I had to level up
Phone book lookin' like my playlist was
What a change, what a journey
What a time, what's the hurry
Musta heard he so damn far from in his prime
Some days I'm a hero
Some nights I'm the villain
Some days I'm here tryna make a change
Some days I'm here just to make a killin'
Some days I'm out for the top
Some days I'm waitin' to drop
Some days I'm happy with what I got
Some days overwhelming to know I'm not
Odds lookin' like the universe against me
If we talkin' problems, knowin' I got plenty
But I got the power, million miles an hour
Ripping through the game y'all never shoulda let me
Goin' in raw, don't nobody protect me
On into infinity these gems gon' let me
I been building up a team like the MCU
I guess when you living dreams they gon' envy you
Ain't a rapper in the game who could end me dude
You a phase in a game, where the trendy lose
Train of thought on track while you ride caboose
I don't fuck with these coat tail riding dudes
I'm in a hell of a mood, off a hell of a tune
So you better get goin' or I'll make you move
That's the truth, I ain't got time to lose
Cause there ain't no tellin' what I'm 'bout to do

'Till I'm riding with the best I'm grinding
But in the dark every spark seems blinding
Every win's just a door to a bigger goal
Every step you could fall into a bigger hole
Know I can't let it get to me
If I do I become my own enemy
Drunk off the power that's a hell of hangover
Most can't take it so best you stay sober

I'm Thanos with that gauntlet powers infinite
Just be happy that the kid ain't been abusing it
I'm a hero or a villain I still can't decide
Feel like every single thought I been switching sides

Power, drunk off the power
I think it's clouding my vision
Power, drunk off the power
Look at the voice I been given
Power, drunk off the power
Stop poppin' bottles of that
Stop tripping on tracks
Let's celebrate for the night
Let's celebrate where we at
