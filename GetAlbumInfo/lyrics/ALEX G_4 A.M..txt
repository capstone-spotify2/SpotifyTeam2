Itâs pouring rain at 4 a.m.
I feel so close to you right now
But have you fallen for me yet?
Iâd let you go but I donât know how

And I know itâs just another night
But I fell for you again
And I remember when

You didnât wanna waste a moment
You were captured in my arms
And stolen by my eyes
Itâs still your heart that lifts me
And your words that can kill me
But still Iâd run for miles
Just to be near you

Oh ohhhâ¦

Your presence lingers on my neck
I canât let go of you right now
Iâm kinda scared of what comes next
I might just die if you forget

And I know itâs just another night
but I fell for you again
And I remember when

You didnât wanna waste a moment
You were captured in my arms
And stolen by my eyes
Itâs still your heart that lifts me
And your words that can kill me
But still Iâd run for miles

You cut me open
And you fill me with this hope
When you know this whole thingâs hopeless
And Iâm hopelessly hoping
That you will see
What lies inside of me

Itâs pouring rain at 4 a.m.
I feel so close to you right now

And I donât wanna waste this moment
Captured in your arms
And stolen by your eyes eyes
Itâs still your heart that lifts me
And your words that can kill me
But still Iâd run for miles

So close so close now
Donât let go let go now
Wonât you fall for me tonight?

Itâs still your heart that lifts me
And your words that can kill me
But still Iâd run for miles
Just to be near you
