Hey baby, it's you again
If you're gonna play, you've got to play to win
Hey baby, the time is right
Only tonight he's out of sight

I know it's you, for what I know
Tell all the guys, it's time to go
Your love is all I need
For ever and ever is what I seek

Oh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

I can't share your love alone
If not tonight, oh baby, then I'm gone
Whatever you say, I know you're right
Only tonight, only tonight

Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

And I can't share your love alone
If not tonight and then I'm gone
Whatever you say, oh, sure you're right
Only tonight, only tonight, only tonight

Ooh baby, oh baby, ooh
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

Ooh baby, oh baby
We've got love
Hold on, hold on, hold on
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it
