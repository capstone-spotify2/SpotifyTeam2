As the door over left behind to
Stand wide open for us to see
There is one thing in life I told you
I can see you but you can't see me, yeah

That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way it is

As my Father up in heaven above
Shining star that is full of love
And He is a big surprise that just open your hearts
And if that's one thing that I'm mighty proud of
You see now

There are sometimes when you make me happy
There are sometimes when you make me sad
But that's a part of life give it what you have
To all I ask is forget the bad

That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way it is

All your smiles and your all your lies won't
Oh,  erase the pain inside, yeah
Hold your self and your serenity
'Cause I can see you this evening
And can't you see me, well?

That's the way, that's the way it is, yeah
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, let me say that's the way it is
That's the way

And you must believe all the things I tell you
You won't believe all the words I say
Now one little thing in life I'm rest assured of
Heavenly father's gonna make a way in <i>[?]</i>

I will, yeah, I wanna clap my hands
Wanna clap my hands
Let me, let me clap my hands
