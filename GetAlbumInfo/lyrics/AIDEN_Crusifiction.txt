My name is Roman,
Not king nor emperor.
Just the voice of a ghost, the past son of a whore.
I transcend to dispatch this letter.
Where the rich bought rape the poor.
You can astound this human race.
You can embrace lies built on faith.
You can manipulate a simple story.

For fear!, panic!, glory!
Fuck your God.
Fuck your faith in the end,
There's no religion.

Would you open your eyes already.
Christ died for shit and was a fucking cunt.
We were brothers born to build an army.

For fear!, panic!, glory!
Fuck your God.
Fuck your faith in the end,
There's no religion.

Standing on the edge of insanity,
Wishing there was more time to explain.
We were brothers born a prostitute.
A thief of a beggar,
There is a new God.
I am the devil.

Fuck your God.
Fuck your faith in the end,
There's no religion.

Fuck my God,
There is no God.
