It's the same old situation, it seems it's coming around again.
I won't play the fool, I'm not screwing around.
I only play to win. I only want what I deserve so who are you
trying to kid? You can call it like you see it,
but I call it like it is. I'm sick of shrugging off your petty little ways.
The names are always changing, in the end it's just a game.
We're running in a circle, a never ending chase.
You keep on stepping out of reach, but you never win the race.
No more waiting around, no more hanging around,
no more dragging me down.
Everything's so easy for you,
but I've struggled to get this far. I'm all alone in the fight.
What's wrong, who's right? I take it all to heart.
Your true colors start to show, you call yourself a friend.
The teams are drawn, you chose your side, you'll get yours in the end.
You play along to the same old song just as long as you can win.
When someone better comes along,
you're too cool to let them in.
So now I've got you wondering if I've got it in for you.
I'd like to tell you different, but I can't because it's true.
