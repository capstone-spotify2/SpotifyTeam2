A bit more time till I get that sign that tells me I can go
Evolution the solution, heres some tickets to my show
Escape this in case you canât identify my flow
Gotta wake up and make my take of this forsaken word
Fitted cap on ready to get my night on
A-life grey coveringâ up my toes, felineâ double oh seven
Sneaking up in the darkness, showinâ up is the hardest
Iâm alarming, the door kicks open
I see my boys and some kush gettinâ smoked in
In and out the door, ate a bit, refrigerator with the 40s
Priority of tonight is unite us

<i>[Dave:]</i>
Hear the rhythm and bump
Fall in love with the funk
Let us hand off the vibe to you
Hands up high if you want it
Give me nothinâ Iâma write a song
Give a shit what outsiderâs on
Never have and I wonât stop
You can tell me anything you want

<i>[Carter:]</i>
Even, thinkinâ about, and drinkinâ that
Shit from last night, I canât do it
Weak stomach, spendinâ cash on the rum and the drugs
Even if the stocks have plummeted
To the ground, compensation with a good time
And it sounds like you gotta go, no more time for me
Itâs like a rhino muy thai fighting a freak
But then I jolt awake, bout to break, headache stronger than the power of fate
And I remember back, it goes
1 shot, 2 shot, 3 shot, all the way to ten like Lil Jonâs living in the back of my head
Then the blackening begins, sins were happeninâ like the rapture being captured again

One, two, three
Scream out loud
Fighting for you
I said we fight for the youth
(The Reach, aha! Yeah!)
