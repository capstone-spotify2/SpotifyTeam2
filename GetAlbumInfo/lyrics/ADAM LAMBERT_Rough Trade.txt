You gotta give to get back
A shot of karma to throw back
You gotta give to get all you crave
Rough trade

Not preaching I just want to tell ya
Don't buy what the people will sell ya
Not preaching I just want to tell ya I'm made
Rough trade

Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Always gonna get off

My daddy raised quite a sinner
Taught that the line was much thinner
'Tween me all the lines are uphold holy crusades
Rough trade

You gotta count all the lions
While keeping track of the liars
You gotta count all the lyin's you made
Rough trade

Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Always gonna get off

Only before it's done
Suck on a smoking gun
Make like a hit and run
Ooooh

Only before it's done
Suck on a smoking gun

Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Always gonna get off
