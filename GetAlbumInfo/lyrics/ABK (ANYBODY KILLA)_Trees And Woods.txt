You ever chase after Death? 
People chase after Death everyday 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
And don't even realize 
But watch out, watch out, ya never know when it's gonna 
chase after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 

Bet ya never seen us coming, while you was just chillin' 
Overnight sounds so dark and thrillin' 
With the quickness 
I bring the sickness 
Run hurry hurry run 
Ya really got to feel this 
To the outside we look ungifted 
But look deeper into yourself and prove your own existence 
Treat me like I'm unfree 
When neighborhoods are burnin' down to the third degree 
To visualize is my own teepee 
Because the hate we try to stop all began with me 
Reincarnation, like it or not 
But when you at Death's door we gonna see what you got 
Standing up on that platform 
Mad as hell cause you was never well informed 
I guarantee you're gonna wanna come back 
With a whole new life that's so compact 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 

I've been chasin' but you couldn't tell 
You've been hidin' but I guess you fell 
Now, it's something that you gotta deal with 
Six feet deep all sleep for you, kid 
I can't stop chasin' 
Don't know what I'm facin' 
Everytime I turn around 
I'm chasin' after you 
Could this be all I am? 
A trapped soul in the shell of a man? 
No one would ever understand 
But I guess that was the plan 
So I guess I'm gonna try and relax 
And only lay down straight up facts 
Is there anyone out there that sees what I see 
Passed on life tryin' to reach me? 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 

Why do we feel how we feel inside? 
You ever think about when it's time to die? 
Not knowin' when 
Not knowin' how 
Quittin' like a coward takin' yourself out 
Livin' life chasin' after Death 
Ya never know how much time is left 
Sure glad I can depend on ya'll 
Pickin' me up when I start to fall 
Never makin' me feel left out 
So I swear to the earth I'll never let ya doubt 
That I, don't feel the same way inside 
Take a good look into a killa's eyes 
I'm told everywhere I go 
that I'm held cause of my technique 
So take ya time, and listen real slow 
Cause these words are deep that I speak 
Listen up, listen up 

<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 

And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
Chasing after you 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
Chasing after you
