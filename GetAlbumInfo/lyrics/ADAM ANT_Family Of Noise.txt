A lot of people busy busy busy busy busy
Being very modern

The family of noise is here
And it's come to save everybody

They loved only quiet
And then along came the machine
And a new direction

The family of noise is here

And the family of noise

In the morning
Last thing at night
In the darkness
Standing in the light

A lot of people in this great big world
Just searching for the pure sound
They're just looking to the machine
They don't listen to the noise

The family of noise is here
And it's come to save everybody
The family of noise is here
And it's come to save you and me
