Hey there all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out sittin' on a fence
So get off your arse and come down here
Cause rock 'n' roll ain't no riddle man
To me it makes good good sense
Good sense yeah let's go

Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor
We're just listenin' to the rock
That's givin' too much noise
Are you deaf you wanna hear some more
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive
Yes it will

I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
Well I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock 'n' roll instead
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll is just rock 'n' roll

Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' rolling will survive
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll will never die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll

Is just rock 'n' roll
