Walking in, walking sin
Everything but a halo (halo, halo, halo)
Leather dress, nothing less
Than a villain to take home (take home, take home)
Love to stare, we prefer
Getting boys into trouble (trouble, trouble)
Let you see, such a tease
Want to dance with the devil?

<i>[Chorus x2:]</i>
Jump the gun, we got the boom, boom, bang!
Jump the gun, we got the boom, boom, bang!
Jump the gun, we got the boom, boom, bang!
The boom, boom, bang!
Got the boom, boom, bang!

Hit the lights, hypnotize
Feel the heat, we're on fire (fire, fire, fire)
Don't believe what you see
Cause my truth is a liar (liar, liar)
Evil minds, got it right
Scratch you up if I want to (want to, want to)
Got my fix, this is it
Now I don't even want you (want you, want you)

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

<i>[Bridge x2:]</i>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Bang, bang)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Na na na na

<i>[Chorus x2]</i>

<i>[Bridge x2]</i>
