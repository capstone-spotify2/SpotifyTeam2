Closer, to the edge
I feel freedom in the air
Dying to escape but the fear makes us afraid

Lover, let me know
Do you feel it? When the close
We were burning, till we froze
Fire and ice
Fire and ice, let me go

Why you coming at me telling me that I am crazy when everything that I gave you, you decide to break

We were only ever heading for a never never know you know I'm never gonna make the same mistake

You and I go together like fire and ice
You and I go together like fire and ice

You were only ever heading for a never never now you know I'm never ever gonna make the same mistake

You and I go together like fire and ice
like fire and ice
like fire and ice

Running in the dark
I've been searching for a spark
We were hurting worlds apart
So I crawl, crawling back to your heart

Useless, on my own
If you love me, you won't let me go
When you leave I feel so cold
Fire and ice
Fire and ice, soothes my soul

Why you coming at me telling me that I am crazy when everything that I gave you, you decide to break

We were only ever heading for a never never know you know I'm never gonna make the same mistake

You and I go together like fire and ice
You and I go together like fire and ice

You were only ever heading for a never never now you know I'm never ever gonna make the same mistake

You and I go together like fire and ice
like fire and ice
like fire and ice
