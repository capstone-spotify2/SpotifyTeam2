In my suburb, you and me
We'll go at night when they're asleep
We'll be the ones that they can't be
In my suburb

We live outside the city
So every Wednesday night
You know we take our chances
When we're stepping out of line
We're meeting up at Colin's
That's where we plan our crime
With whatever we can find
With whatever we can find

In my suburb, make believe
The picture perfect family
That's what we expect to be
In my suburb, you and me
We'll go at night when they're asleep
We'll be the ones that they can't be

Just another, wasted summer, in my suburb!
Just another, wasted summer in my suburb!

You have to keep your head down
We know they won't find us
We're heading back to Colin's
We cover up our faces
In my suburb
In my suburb
Until they're out of sight
Even if they tried
One o'clock at night
Climb into the window
Don't turn on the light
Don't turn on the light

In my suburb, make believe
The picture perfect family
That's what we expect to be
In my suburb, you and me
We'll go at night when they're asleep
We'll be the ones that they can't be

Just another, wasted summer, in my suburb!
Just another, wasted summer in my suburb!

Got to make it out alive, or we die (In my suburb)
