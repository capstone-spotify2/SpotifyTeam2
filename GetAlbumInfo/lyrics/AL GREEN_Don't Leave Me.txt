(Don't leave me, Baby
Baby don't leave)

Let's make our love last, pretty baby
Don't leave me, baby
Give love a chance
Baby, stand by me
Don't leave, baby

Though you think I cheated on you
Believe me, I've been true
Please, don't you leave
Don't treat me this way
I beg you, won't you stay?

Sing the song now

I love you, baby
(Don't leave me, baby)
My my my
I'll save all my love
For you and God above
(Baby don't leave)

I love you madly
(Baby)
Don't leave
(Don't leave me, baby)
Down on my knees
I beg and plead

Though you think I cheated on you
Believe me, I've been true
Please, don't you leave
Don't treat me like waste
I beg you, won't you stay?

Baby, please darlin'
Down on bended knees
(Don't leave me, baby)
All I need is you, baby
Lord, baby baby
(Baby don't leave)
Baby, don't leave
Down on bended knees
I beg and plead
(Don't leave me, baby)
And of all the pain..
And I know pain
Is to love someone in vain
(Baby don't leave)
Baby, baby, baby
Please stay, darlin'
(Don't leave me, baby)
