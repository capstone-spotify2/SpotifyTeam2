Where were you? Say you were gone?
Well, ask me and I'll swear you were there all along. 
Another place? Another state?
At any rate, I can't relate. 
There's no two ways, you're a disgrace. 
Drown down your fear, suffocate every spark of clarity. 
Your weakness: sickens me, saddens me, strengthens me. 
There's no way to free responsibility.
Who's to blame? Who's in the wrong? 
The truth from which you hide - it was you all along. 
You were there, you didn't care, 
and your heart and mind were self impaired. 
Now, all that's left is our despair.
