Let's go

You tell me how to live my life
But you don't live your own
Your bark is louder than your bite
Better leave me alone
It's war

This is why I choose to fight
Drink all day and rock all night

From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
I will never be a slave
From the cradle to the grave
Get outta my way oh yeah

It's like you're six feet under ground
Coz you're rotten to the core
You know I'm never backing down
It's a generation war
It's war

This is why I choose to fight
Drink all day and rock all night

From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
I will never be a slave
From the cradle to the grave

Get out of my way

This is why I choose to live
Giving all I've got to give
From the cradle...
To the grave

From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
Don't tell me how to live my life
Coz you don't live your own
Live you own

Your bark is louder than your bite
Better leave me alone

From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
I will never be a slave
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
I will never be a slave
From the cradle to the grave
