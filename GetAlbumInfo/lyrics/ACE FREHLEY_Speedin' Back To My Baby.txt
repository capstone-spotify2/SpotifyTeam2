I'm drivin' down the road, doin' 95 miles per hour, oh yeah
My radio's blastin' and I'm passin' cars faster and faster, uh huh
I'm feelin' kinda down 'cause I left her with a frown, my baby, oh yeah
We always seem to fight when things are goin' right and maybe, uh huh

Maybe I should turn around
Maybe I should stop
Maybe I should turn around 

Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe 
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe

You know, maybe I should turn around
Maybe I should stop 
Maybe I should turn around 

I'm lookin' for a station, 'cause there's no acceleration to get back
(Speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Oh yeah
My gage is showin' red and my battery's dead, I'd better
(Ooh, speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Find one fast 

The whole thing began 'cause I saw her with a man, my baby
(Ooh, speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Oh yeah
I really wouldn't mind, but you know I've got my pride to think of
(Ooh, speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Uh huh

Maybe I should turn around
Maybe I should stop
Maybe I should turn around 

Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe 
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe 

I found me a station, now I got acceleration to get back
(Speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Oh yeah
She's my only girl and to me she's just the world, so maybe
(Ooh, speedin' back, ooh speedin' back) Uh huh

Maybe I should turn around
Maybe I should stop
Maybe I should turn around 

Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe 
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe 

Speedin' back to my baby (Oh speedin' back)
And I don't mean maybe (oh, oh, oh)
Speedin' back to my baby (Oh speedin' back)
And I don't mean maybe 

Speedin' back to my baby (Speedin' back, speedin' back)
And I don't mean maybe (Speedin' back)
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe
