Hey, are you coming? Are you going?
Brother, are you just wasting time
Is there a rhyme or a reason
And when you're gonna make up your mind

Are you holding back your tears?
Will you ever let the river flow?
Or are you caught up in your fears?
Let the living water save your soul

Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along
And let go, just let go

I am with you on this journey
I'll be with you till the end of time
You know you'll never ever be abandoned
So precious, this child of mine

Jesus in my arms I will hold you
This world at times it seems so unkind
Walk with faith into His glory
Let go and let your spirit fly

Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along and let go

Don't you wanna be with your brothers
Marching with that angel band
And let go, just let go

Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along

Let go, let go, let it go
Let go, let it go
And let it go, let it go
Just let go, let it go
Let go
