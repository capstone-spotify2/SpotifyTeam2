My deja vu...you're my obsession

My deja vu everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search
We'll get the magic back again
My deja vu everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search

I wanna see you dancing naked
I wanna see you touch the moon
But when I try to reach your fingers
You just vanish into air
I wanna feel you with my senses
'Cause I'm almost sure the texture of your skin
Is gonna tell me who you are

My deja vu you're my obsession
My deja vu it's always you

My Deja Vu...

I wanna hold you like I used to
I wanna feel you in my blood
I wonder why I do confess this
To myself all the time
I know the time is working against us
But I'll long for you the rest of my whole life
Like a prisoner of hope

My deja vu you're my obsession
My deja vu it's always you

I have tried to get to know you
To get you off my mind
It feels like going back in time
And snap, I see your finger once again
My deja vu everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search

My deja vu you're my obsession
My deja vu it's always you
My deja vu you're my obsession
