Please tell me why we couldn't stay
Don't let this feeling ever go away
Let this memory forever be inside of me
Through every hour of every day
It's with the company of these friends
That we drove on through the night
We were carried by the wheels of armageddon

We're gonna force ourselves to live
Thankful it's hurt more than we've ever felt
It's just our means to an end

Please tell me why we couldn't stay
Don't let this feeling ever go away
Let this memory forever be inside of me
Through every hour of every day
It's with the company of these friends
That we drove on through the night
We were carried by the wheels of armageddon

And honestly we were armed with our best intentions
Maybe those intentions alone
are just enough to get us anywhere but here
In the middle of America
Six cylinders will take us further than any president
The same promises that we forgot the last time
There's no difference between staying and a bullet in the head

So fucking tell me why we couldn't stay
Don't let this feeling ever go away
Let this memory forever be inside of me
Through every hour of every day
It's with the company of these friends
That we drove on through the night
We were carried by the wheels of armageddon

Maybe it's gonna come from the radio
Or the next 8 hour day
Driving to the next town
A collect call home to your best friend
We are the company we keep
We could live off of dumpsters if we have to
Sell our blood by the pint to make rent
This kind of dignity doesn't come easy
But you'll never find it for sale

And that's why we couldn't stay
But never let that feeling ever go away
Kept to memory, inside of us
Through every hour, through every day
Until we die
It's with the company of those friends
We drove on through the night
Behind the wheels of armageddon
