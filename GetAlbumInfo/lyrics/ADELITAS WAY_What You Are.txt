If I could take it back
I know that really I would
If this was all a movie
You wouldn't even pull
But I remember when you'd say
Seems like you even mattered
Here we go again, insane
Seems like you would have happened
To let me be your world
She let me be...

To let me be your world
When you...
She let me be her world
When you...
But you didn't matter
We all knew just what you were
But you didn't matter
Take your life for what it's worth
Cause you never mattered

When I look back again
Used to think you were better
I kinda laugh at this
I used to think you were better
To let me be your world
You let me be...

To let me be your world
When you...
She let me be her world
When you...
But you didn't matter
We all knew just what you were
But you didn't matter
Take your life for what it's worth
Cause you never mattered

Since you've come
Life's been wasted
Few <i>[?]</i>
I feel good
Since you're gone
All the time I've wasted
I'm feelin' better now
Gotta keep you on
I'm feelin' better now
Gotta keep you on
I'm feelin' better now
Gotta keep you on
I'm feelin' better now
Gotta keep you on
I'm feelin' better now
Gotta give you up

We all knew just what you were
But you didn't matter
Take your life for what it's worth
Cause you never mattered
We all just knew just what you were
Take your life for what it's worth
Cause you didn't matter
