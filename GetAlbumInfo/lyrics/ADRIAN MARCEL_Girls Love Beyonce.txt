I know girls love Beyonce
She drop a single we listen
She fuck around with my conscience
I turn around and act different

These days it's hard to meet niggas
Feel like my love life is finished
I ain't even started yet
I just stay away from all the commitment

I'm scared to let somebody in on it
No new friends, no no new
You see I'm on the rise
Where were you when I was broke?

You watch me all on twitter
Now you wanna call my phone
Say you're all alone
Well if you're alone then say

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't running game

Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby, why the sudden change?

Say my name <i>[x3]</i>
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Say my name, say my name
Cause those other girls were practice
It ain't no room for trippin
&amp; I'm sick of all your actin
Like you ain't call me last night, 3:30
Talkin bout you wanted me
And say you never meant to hurt me

This is why I been saying
No bullshit no no no
Ain't nobody got time for that
This is not 3 years ago
Laid off from my 9 to 5
So I don't do that shit no more

Time is of the essence
So it's get money and fuck these hoes
Where I learn them values
I can tell you that it's not from home

People love this music
Man I swear to you my mind is blown
Seven days a week
I work seven days a week
My nigga A.M. he don't fuck with seven days a week

But when I go home who I come home to?
I don't wanna cry no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna spend a lonely night no more
But I be alone cause
My pride won't let me change
Say you want another chance
I might give you one someday
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't running game

Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby, why the sudden change?

Say my name <i>[x3]</i>
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Show me that it's real boy
Say my name
