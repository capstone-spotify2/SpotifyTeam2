She won't let me fuck.
I really need to bust a nut.

(Hey, check this out.)

Things we need to do, every other day or two

Her heart is still broken, (Poor baby.) her emotions are sore. (I know what you mean, girl.)
She is trying to recover from the man before. (Hey, that's my homeboy, cause.)
Her ex-boyfriend, (Who, Jermaine?) he probably can't see (shake that ass.)

In the year 2000 I see thousands of pretty young women I find arousin'
Grocery store shopping, magazine browsin', many different ways they keep their hair styles and
Full of boredom, I walk toward 'em, get 'em close to me cause I'm supposed to be
Male aggressor, female impresser. Say the right things, possibly undress her.
But that's the post game, this is still the pre-game.
Silly woman She-game. Baby, what's your name?
Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek, crack a smile and politely speak
With intellect to the woman I select, hoping that she won't detect
my egotistical chauvinistical lust I thrust 'til I scream like Mystical.
The wrong message I hope I'm not sending. Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending.
Can't be overzealous, she might discover. She's walkin' away, (Bitch!) blew my cover.

She won't let me fuck. (You know I love you.)
I really need to bust a nut. (Please don't change the subject.)
She won't let me fuck. (We could've fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut. (but, but, but, but your telephone number is wrong.)

She won't let me fuck. (Girl you got a lot to give.)
I really need to bust a nut. (You dress, you dress, so provocative.)
She won't let me fuck. (I can see your lingerie, from real far away.)
I really need to bust a nut. (Bitch, you must think I'm gay.)

Don't make me beg. Baby, let me rub your leg.
Don't make me cry. Look into my eye.
Girl, you damn pretty. Stop actin' so siddity. Put some oil on your titties.
Hey, man, I'm up outta here. She don't wanna fuck.
