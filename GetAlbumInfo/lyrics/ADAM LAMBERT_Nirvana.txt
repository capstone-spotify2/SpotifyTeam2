When the stars are too cold
Frozen over the glow
On the edge of the night
We can be their light
So give me more than your touch
And give yourself to the rush
Just keep holding my hand
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land

We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down

Through the dark there's a way
There's a love, there's a place
Where we don't have to hide
We can dream all night
So follow me through the sky
And watch the oceans collide
Just keep holding my hand
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land

We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
And I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down

Oh, we don't need any diamonds or gold
Watch the mystic and cryptic unfold
As we fly high

Ooooooh ey, ey, ey ey

We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
And I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
I'll lay you down, lay you down
I'll lay you down, lay you down
