When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so
And yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You may leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I know I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
First you love me
Then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm still in love with you

I, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you

I, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
