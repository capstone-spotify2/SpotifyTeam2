Starting to come together
Starting to all make sense
We began to blossom, so perfect
I'm starting to understand

And you have made this cove for us, again

If this was any other day
I'd surely just walk away

Working it out so perfect
A picture worth a thousand words, 
Can't believe we took it, so wasted
I'm starting to understand

And i gather all myself, for you
