The full moons glowing out so bright 
It's light out on the highway
I can't hear the engine for the 
Wheels out on the road
The wind is blowing freezing
But it keeps my eyes wide open
It's 3AM an drivin's far 
And it hauls a heavy load 

I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long

100 miles from no where
There are houses on the highway
Empty and a dark place 
That someone once called home 
Maybe they put sheets on chairs
And tables like the movies
But I know in that in real life 
There as empty as my soul

I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long

And if I fail and I turn my wheel
Into that semi coming
I know well that there's a man in there 
Just trying to get home
And waiting up and worrying 
Is a woman loves him dearly
Ain't thinking clearly 
Cause I been drivin all night long

People think I'm lazy
And I'm scared to just stop runnin
People think I'm crazy
And I don't know that she's gone
But I know that I got 200 miles 
To make fore mornin
I don't think too much
Cause I been drivin all night long

I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long

I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long
