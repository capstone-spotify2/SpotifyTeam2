Entertain me for the tenth hour in a row again
Anesthetize me with your gossip and many random anecdotes
And fill every hour with activity or ear candy
Drop me off at intersections in any city metropolitan
And keep me in this state
And keep me purgatorying
And sing me back to sleep
This is far more than I had bargained for
Start every week with a break-neck urgent design
And end every speed day with my briefcase representing free time
Spending my fruits my purchases become my lifeline
Please give my love to my family 
I'll doubtfully be home at christmas time
Don't disturb me in this state
Please leave me purgatorying
I'll be damned if i'm to wake
This is far more than i am equipped for
I've held you up like a deity
Like you're the sole owner of wings
This unrequited tunnel vision
And i wonder why i've not been writing
Please keep me in this state
Please keep me purgatorying
Please rock me back to sleep
This love is more than - than i have bargained for
I'll be damned if i'm to wake
This is far more than i'm equipped for
