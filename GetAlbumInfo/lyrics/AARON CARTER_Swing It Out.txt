Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
You stood out amongst the crowd 
And I was left without a doubt 
That you were meant for me 
So romanced was I by you 
One dance and then I knew 
That I could fall in love, oh yeah 
Oh baby won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing it out, girl swing it out, girl swing it <i>[7x]</i>
I have never known before 
A girl I wanted more 
The way I want you now 
I admit you are the best 
And with you I am obsessed 
And could never do without 
Oh baby, won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
I, I like to watch you when you dance 
(When you, watch you when you dance) 
And tonight don't you make any other plans 
Unless you're making them with me 
Swing it, swing it, swing it (2x) 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out.
