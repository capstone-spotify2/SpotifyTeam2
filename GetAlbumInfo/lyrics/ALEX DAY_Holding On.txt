A million and one thousand things are screaming in my head
And I can't seem to forget, can't stop thinking about you
I could ride across the sky in a bicycle built for two
Could you teach me how to ride, like you taught me how to feel alive?

And not a single day goes by when I don't wish for you
To watch me pause to find the words to steal your heart away
But I'll play every word back round and round to try and find
A clue you might have left behind to say you feel the same

And even if I know
I'll never be your Leo
I'll keep holding on

A hundred and three thousand ghosts are laughing in my dreams
My eyes are failing me, everywhere I look I see you
I could bake a chocolate cake for you with tiers up to the moon
Could you show me how it's done, like you showed me how to fall in love?

You'll never see that I'm the one who never left you
When you needed me to cry to 'cos your heart got broke again
So I'll play until the strings on my guitar give out, 
And I'll be aching from the pain of trying to pretend

And even if I know
I'll never be your Leo
I'll keep holding on
