Memories saved destined to capture
decades passing by
A way to remember
(We need to remember)

Moments fade leaving to rejoin
decades passing by
Let's savor the present
But not lose the future

The shifting sands of time
Pour from the past
But you don't know then
What you hate to now

I try to argue but I'm not getting through
Close your eyes and sing along with me
Relive the memory

We've been here before and I'm begging for more
A destination so beautiful I'm speechless

Idle hands are the devil's playground
Problem solved
Get off your ass and pretend that you care
Nothing will change if we don't stand and fight
Call us to arms into the night
If we all take it for granted music soon will die
It's vanishing slowly, through ignorant madness
If you see what's wrong take a stand and scream out loud
If they want silence then disappoint them all

I try to argue but I'm not getting through
Close your eyes and sing along with me
Relive the memory

We've been here before and I'm begging for more
A destination so beautiful I'm speechless
(I'm speechless)

A positive mental attitude
(Dare to put your pen to the page
Fearlessly imagine your own tale)
Open doors and we're walking through
The music survives if we keep the songs alive

Step inside and relive the dream
of a young boy who tried to sing
and managed to fly
His story should never die

Idle hands are the devil's playground
Problem solved
Get off your ass and pretend that you care
Nothing will change if we don't stand and fight
Call us to arms into the night

With smiles and open arms
We all embrace the underdog!

DREAM!

Dream of a yet unvisited renaissance
A time when music will shimmer with hope

I try to argue but I'm not getting through
Close your eyes but...
I try to argue but I'm not getting through
Close your eyes and sing along with me
Relive the memory

We've been here before and I'm begging for more
A destination so beautiful I'm speechless
