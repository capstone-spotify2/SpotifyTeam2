Ah, yeah

It's been so long
That it's wrong
Don't let me wonder life alone
Cuz' there is a reason
It's not the season
It is time for us to fall in love

Give me a sign now
Show me the way
Take my hand, I won't be afraid
Show me the love that blew me away
I said

Ah, yeah
I feel alive
Ah, yeah
This feels so right
When you hold me
When you kiss me
The way you let me shine
Ah, yeah
This love will survive

So whats the deal
What do you feel
Cuz' baby I can't take no more
We've got to be stronger
A little longer
I need you to take control

Give me a sign now
Show me the way
Take my hand, I won't be afraid
Where is the love that blew me away
I said

Ah, yeah

When you kiss me
The way you let me shine
