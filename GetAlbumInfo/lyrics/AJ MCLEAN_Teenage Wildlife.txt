She's gonna flash her eyes under moonlit skies
He's gonna meet her there under the exit sign
Yeah, they both look good, they need to be seen
He's a James Dean rebel, she's a beauty queen
Let's dance, let's dance

She wants to go all night, he wants to make no sense
She wants to feel his kiss, it's so much better tensed
She said "trip the lights", that's what she said
And now she's in his head, she's in his head
Let's dance and let the world fall apart

'Cause I need you tonight
Just howl at the moonlight, I say it two times
I love you, I love
'Cause it feels like
Savage that's civilized
A teenage wildlife
I love you, I love you

She says I get so bored living in this place
We all need to go where the music plays
All night, so let's dance
He said this life's a cage, let's jump the fence
All I want is you let's forget the rest
Let's dance, and let the world fall apart

'Cause I need you tonight
Just howl at the moonlight, I say it two times
I love you, I love you
'Cause it feels like
Savage that's civilized
A teenage wildlife
I love you, I love you

All we fall from the sky when we hear the sound
Go on for miles but won't hit the ground
Don't be afraid they can't catch us now
'Cause baby, we are teenage wildlife

'Cause I need you tonight
Just howl at the moonlight, I say it two times
I love you, I love you
'Cause it feels like
Savage that's civilized
A teenage wildlife
I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
