I remember when we met
You turned away
Burned away
Weâll never be the same

Days and weeks and months and years
All this time
Come to find
Weâre living on again

If thereâs one thing to take away, itâs that I love you

All the times you make me laugh
Falling down
To the sound
Of everything you are

I remind myself sometimes
When I see
You look at me
I find it hard to breathe

The rhymes arenât perfect but neither are you
Consistently youâre still so much more brilliant than me
Will you stay with me
Please stay with me

If thereâs one thing to take away
If thereâs one thing to take away
If thereâs one thing to take away
If thereâs one thing to take away
If thereâs one thing to take away

The rhymes arenât perfect but neither are you
Consistently youâre still so much more brilliant than me
Will you stay with me

I remember when we met
You turned away
Burned away
Weâll never be the same
