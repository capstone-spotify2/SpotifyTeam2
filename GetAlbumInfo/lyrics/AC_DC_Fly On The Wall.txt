Fly on the wall

You can dance, through the night
Rock 'n' roll music itching to fight
Making love, drunk or stoned
Looking for dollar, get broken boned
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ends up the same, sweating out the rain

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall

Take a chance, take a bite
Rock 'n' roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch, making heat
Beating on my chest, licking at my feet
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ending up the same, sweating out the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

I was, trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
Enraged, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

There's a fly on the Wall
