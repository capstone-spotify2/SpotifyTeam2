When God paints, birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrows wings
When God paints, the wind blows
With a stroke of love, he dips his brush in the rainbow

Sometime's I take for granted the simple things
I can be His biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, the heart beats
Life begins, season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white but well defined
When God paints

Sometime's I take for granted the simple things
I can be His biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you, a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints

Sometime's I take for granted the simple things
I can be His biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame
When God paints
