Crazy little party girl 
How I love her 
Partying around the world - she wants to dance 
Crazy little party girl 
There's no other 
Party Party 
Always ready to dance 
Time for a party - time to take a chance 
Turn up the music 
And we'll dance - dance - dance 
Good days are coming - lonely days are gone 
'Cuz I have a little 
Who wants fun - fun - fun 
Everyone - needs a little time 
Everyone - a reason for a smile 
Everyone - wants to love someone 
Everyone - wants to have a little fun 
Crazy little party girl 
How I love her 
Partying around the world - she wants to dance 
Crazy little party girl 
There's no other 
Party party 
Always ready to dance 
Don't try to stop her - don't cha wanna know 
What makes you happy 
Baby please don't go 
I got a feeling - that you'll be alright 
It's a natural feeling 
And it's high - high - high 
Crazy little party girl 
How I love her 
Partying around the world - she wants to dance 
Crazy little party girl 
There's no other 
Party party 
Always ready to dance.
