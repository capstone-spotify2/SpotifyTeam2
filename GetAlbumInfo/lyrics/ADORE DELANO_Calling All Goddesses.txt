Hot nights 
Mystify 
Yeah weâre all about it
Donât tell cast a spell
Ainât no way around it
Mermaids wanna play 
âCause weâre so hypnotic
Ooh

One touch
Theyâre in love
Call me Aphrodite
Too rare not to stare
They all wanna try me
You say sheâs okay 
But thereâs no one like me
Ooh

Aah
Everything we do is magic
Aah
We make other girls look tragic
Calling all goddesses (yeah <i>[x4]</i>) <i>[x4]</i>
(Calling)

(Calling all goddesses) <i>[x2]</i>

Get loud
For the crowd
Flashes pop the cameras
Taboo got my dues
Shot at Cleopatra
Stand up youâre with us
They know all about ya
Ooh

Sirens
On a mission 
To make it happen
We donât need to pose
Itâs not in our fashion
Unleash all we need 
Is a heart to blacken
Ooh

Aah
Everything we do is magic
Aah
We make other girls look tragic
Calling all goddesses (yeah <i>[x4]</i>) <i>[x4]</i>
(Calling)

Calling all goddesses <i>[x2]</i>

We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses <i>[x3]</i>

Calling all goddesses (yeah <i>[x4]</i>) <i>[x4]</i>
(Calling)

We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
We rule the word
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
