I'll be your friend
Though I love you like my brother
I could never be your lover, baby

<i>[Hook: Akinyele, (Tanya Howard)]</i>
Sister, Sister (You're like a brother to me)
Sister, Sister (We go back like family)
Sister, Sister (Nigga I knew you ever since day one)
Sister, Sister (Man, me and you be having mad fun)

<i>[Akinyele]</i>
Yo girls be acting like they my sister
What the fuck
You mess around and get your sister' ass
Inscest up
Talking about you can't buy them like your brother and shit
But we don't got the same father never suck on the same mother tits
So how you come to this
Putting lego sticks
On my dick
Cause you cop-blockin' and shit

<i>[Hook]</i>

<i>[Akinyele]</i>
We used to conversate and shit
For a little bit
You told me about the guys you hit
You said I probably lied about the girls
In the world that I said I done hit
But I let it pass
With a simple laugh (ha ha ha ha)
Cause it was the beginning
So I stay smilin' and grinnin'
Even when you joked and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of
Fucking crushed linen (that shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen Ha ha)
Anyway ha ha ha ha ha
Had to find that funny
So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money
Na na na I ain't said that I ain't said that chill chill
This is what I said
listen, a yo, listen, listen 
Yo, Everytime I try to set it off
You be like Nope
Quick to call the kid up every time you broke
Talkin' about some nigga played you out
Slapped you in your mouth (yo he slapped me in my mouth)
And if I see him you want me to react like pullin' out on him (yo pull out on him)
Risking mafias as I let some kids' blood spill
While you run around town talkin' about (yo nigga I'll get you killed)
Girl don't get me wrong
I'm not no duck and shit
Before I make moves like that 
I got to at least fuck and shit
Bust a nut and shit
In your gut and shit
Fuck you down
Turn you around
In your butt and shit

This right here
Is every brother who got a artificial sister
This is your theme song, yo
This is your theme song
This is your theme song

<i>[Tanya Howard &amp; Niguay Fa]</i>
I'll be your friend
Though I love you like my brother
I could never be your lover, baby

<i>[Akinyele]</i>
National anthem
Yo this song right here is dedicated to
All the girls who want to be some dude's sister
So she could try to get all the priviliges of being a dudes girl
Without fucking that mother fucker
Know what I'm sayin'
