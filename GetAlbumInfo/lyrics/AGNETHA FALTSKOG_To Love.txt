The thought of you beside me
Is doing more than just excite me,
I never thought that I could feel like I do right now.
I'd trade fame and fortune
For a magical potion
That would make you appear
Right here, somehow.

Is this what it means to love?
To feel something words can't even dream of describing
Is this what it means to love?
Comparing something to it,
No, there ain't no way to do it
'Cause only a heart can understand what it means
To love, to love.

I don't wanna live without you
I don't even wanna try to,
But somehow I've got to make you feel the same.
And I refuse to believe it
That you won't go along with it
What am I saying?
There I go dreaming again.

Oh is this what it means to love?
To feel something words can't even dream of describing
Is this what it means to love?
Honey, comparing something to it,
No, there ain't no way to do it
And it's enough for me to stand right here and dream
'Cause only a heart can understand what it means
To love, to love.
