Ooh yeah
Said anything that you want me to and I'll do it
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)

Baby, don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you
(Anything that you want me to I'll do it)

'Cause I'll be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do
(Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)

Now I'm back in a flesh, feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest, let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, baby, I'm back in your vibe

Now I can't be denied I can lie I'm on ya
I never ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of Lake Arriba

Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper
These words comin' out the speaker
True love is off the meter

Don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you
(Anything that you want me to I'll do it)

'Cause I'll be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do
(Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)

I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone till he swears to leave you alone

Let me spark your interest
Now there's no more dating on the internet
'Cause you already know how I get it wet
How I keep it so saucy and I get respect

You don't have to look no farther
You dealin' with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther
You hotter than a fire starter

Don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you
(Anything that you want me to I'll do it)

'Cause I'll be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do
(Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)

I was gone for a minute, I was gone for a minute
I was gone for a minute, I was gone for a minute
Now I'm back let me hit it, now I'm back let me hit it
Now I'm back let me hit it, now I'm back let me hit it

Don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you

'Cause I'll be your lover
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do, do for you

Don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you
(Anything that you want me to I'll do it)

'Cause I'll be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do
(Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)
