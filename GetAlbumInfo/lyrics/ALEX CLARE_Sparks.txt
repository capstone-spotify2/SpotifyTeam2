Fell apart
It all fell apart
Except for this piece
You left in my heart
And I hang on to it
Everyday

There's a beast in me
He's fighting the man
The man who's tryin' to do good
Tryin' to understand
That we can do his best to
Bring you back down

And we're just chasing sparks
We're just chasing those ancient sparks

Said come to the garden
My sister, my wife
And I'll give you the finest things of your life
And you can get lost in the goodness of me

Things got in the way
The that we understood
We failed to do the things that we should
Now we're strugglin' everyday

And we're just chasing sparks
We're just chasing those ancient sparks
We're just chasing sparks

Give us so much of the things we must learn
Gonna hold on to this long as I can
Things we can teach them
So much more we can learn
Gonna hold on to this long as I can
We need to fall apart
Just to make our hearts yearn

Sometimes I fall apart
(Sometimes I fall apart)
(Sometimes I fall apart)

Sometimes I fall apart
(Sometimes I fall apart)

And we're just chasing sparks
We're just chasing those ancient sparks
We're just chasing sparks
We're just chasing those ancient sparks
