Hey baby, won't you take my hand
And make me a happy man
I ain't rich but I found my fortune in you
Two jobs on the nighttime shift
I'm still left with an empty fist
But my heart is full and my love is true
We can still get married in the style of our friends and family
Gather all of them to celebrate while we slip out quietly

And have a hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon just me and you
Hometown honeymoon
Get out of church and up to your room
We'll have a hoe-down afternoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

We can sing and laugh out loud
Lifestyles of the poor but proud
Cuddle up on the porch and enjoy the view
We can't afford Niagara Falls
But there's a fountain by the old town hall
We'll make a wish by the light of a lover's moon
I'll get my Grandma's wedding ring
And my brother's Chevrolet
We can stay at your mama's house;
We don't have to go away

To have a hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

Your daddy's prize possession
I'll make a good impression
I'm gonna get his blessing
That's all we need

Hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon just me and you

Hometown Honeymoon
Get out of church and up to your room
We'll have a hoe-down afternoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

Hometown honeymoon
Hometown honeymoon
Hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom...
