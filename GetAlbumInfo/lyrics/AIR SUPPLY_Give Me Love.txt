I'm tired enough, oh I'm tired
And I feel so weighed down
I don't want failure while my whole life waits around
I need a love just like the rest
And I've waited now so long
I don't take what I can
So I don't find love within
Oh, give me a chance to show some affection
Let something show
I'm the one that said it
I'm the one who needs you now

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh, give me love
Give me love and laughter
Give me love, love, love and laughter
Give me love, give me love and laughter
Give me love, love, love and laughter

I'm with you now and that's all right
But I need more than your touch
Show me where your heart lies
Now I feel like letting go
I could fall so easy for you
And I wouldn't even try
Your love lies lost in me
Keep on kissing mine good-bye
Oh, say the words say you get lonely
Just let me know
You will never regret it
And you'll never be lonely again

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Love, don't take it away
Don't throw it away on somebody
I know there's no one else who needs you more than me

<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
