You always come around
This time of year with your big ole bag
That's full of Christmas cheer
And when it starts to snow
The little boys and girls all know
Soon they'll hear the sound of your reindeer

Now, Sometimes grownups grow up to believe
That you don't really come on Christmas Eve
But I don't think that's true
'Cause I know I've seen you
In the sparking little eyes around the tree

Oh Santa Claus, I still believe in you
There's still a kid inside of me
That still believes you're true
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are tucked in tight
The hour has arrived
It's time to play ole Santa Clause tonight

Well, I don't see how anybody could ever doubt
That there's really a Santa Claus.
Especially if they've ever seen a little boy
Who just got his very first bike
Or if they've ever seen a little girl
With her arms wrapped around her baby doll,
So tight, And both of 'em waking up
Mama and Daddy way before daylight
And Grandma and Grandpa
Just looking young and lovin' life,
'Cause they know that their grandkids
Are gonna be alright
And Mama and Daddy,
They'll be waitin' up to answer ole Santa's call.
"Cause tonight their not worried about paying bills,
Lord they're just lovin' it all

Oh Santa Claus, I still believe in you
There's still a kid in all of us
That still believes you're true
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are sleepin' tight
We're turning out the lights
And I'll be waiting up for you tonight

Santa Claus, the kids are tucked in tight
Santa Claus, turning out the light
Oh Santa Claus,

I still believe in you...
