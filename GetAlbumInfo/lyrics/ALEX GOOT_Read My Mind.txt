Write a hook write a verse write a chorus write a melody
Canât express how I feel without singing it the right way
Iâm doing better now Iâm doing good
Iâm doing all the things I know I know I should

Will I find a way to tell her how I feel about her?
Will she come to me and will she read my mind?
Will she read my mind?

Heâs the one in my dreams but I can not tell him anything
Canât express how I feel even if it is the right way
Iâm doing better now Iâm doing good
Iâm doing all the things I know I know I should

Will I find a way to tell him how I feel about him?
Will he come to me and will he read my mind?
Will he read my mind?

Hey everything I need is right in front of me
Hey everything I need is right in front of me

Here I go hereâs my burst of emotion
Here I go now Iâm telling you, telling you
swallow all of my pride for the first time
Donât know what to say

Will I find a way to tell her how I feel about her?
Will he come to me and will he read my mind?

Will I find a way (to tell him how I) how I feel about her?
Will she come to me (and will he read my mind)?
Will she read my mind?
Will she read my mind?
