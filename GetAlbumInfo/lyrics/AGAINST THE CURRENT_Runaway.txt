You and me are hell-bent on heartbreak
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Don't act like loving me is such a bad thing
No matter what ya say

Let's get this right, don't take it slow
Let's not pretend we've never met before
Cause baby this love is something we both know
But it's been trapped in a cage like an animal

And now we're dancing under streetlights
Drunk on twilight
You say yours when I'm calling you mine
See your name in the sidewalk cracks
Wanna be anywhere you're at
All I ever really need is you
This time we're gonna see this through
So if we ever lose our way again
Take my hand we'll make it back

You and me are hell-bent on heartbreak
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Don't act like loving me is such a bad thing
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Won't let you run away

I told myself it would be alright
But you lurk in the shadows deep inside my mind
I couldn't escape all the memories
Stuck in my head like pretty melodies

Now we're dancing under streetlights
Drunk on twilight
You say yours when I'm calling you mine
See your name in the sidewalk cracks
Wanna be anywhere you're at
All I ever really need is you
This time we're gonna see this through
So if we ever lose our way again
Take my hand we'll make it back

You and me are hell-bent on heartbreak
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Don't act like loving me is such a bad thing
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Won't let you run away

Used to be just me and you
Acting like we couldn't lose oh oh
Let's do the things we used to do
If you're the fire, I'm the fuel
Just like when our love was new

You and me are hell-bent on heartbreak
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Don't act like loving me is such a bad thing
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away

You and me are hell-bent on heartbreak
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away
Don't act like loving me is such a bad thing
No matter what ya say
Won't let you run away

Won't let you run away
Won't let you run away
Won't let you run away
Won't let you run away
