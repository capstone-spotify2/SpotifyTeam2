Last stand
Down to my last dime
I ain't got the sense to leave
The dealers cutting fine
Last throw
Back against the wall
Depending where the money is
Is where I'm gonna fall
Ace high
Hide your poker eyes
I didn't wanna laugh too much when
When I picked up the prize
Lady luck
Is standing at my side
I leave with more than I brought in
And get out with my life
Get out with my life

I go, you go
She go, we go
Two's up
Two's up
Gimme head, gimme tails
Gimme double up an' comin'
Doubled over on the rails
Gimme two's up
That's what I want

High up
When you're lookin' down
Then you see two animals just foolin' you around
Stray dogs
Gonna take them in
Don't know what your names are
Where you're goin' and where ya been
All day it's difficult to say, who is doin'
What was doing what to who, who's callin' out the play
I love, the way you slide an' slip
I like the way you girls work out
And make a partnership
Make that partnership
I go, you go
She go, we go
Two's up
Yes it's a two's up
Gimme head, gimme tails
Gimme double up an' comin'
Doubled over on the rails
Gimme
Gotta gimme double or quits

Two's up
Two's up
Like your partnership
Like the way you slip
There ain't nothing like a
That's the way it is
That's what I wanna hear
Gimme head, gimme tails
Gimme double up an' comin'
Over on the rails
Slow combustion
Drive me wild
Gimme head, gimme you
Gimme twice the satisfaction
Twice as far to go
And it's a two's up
Gonna be two's up
We're gonna have a two's up
Two's up
Two's up
There ain't nothing like a
Two's up
