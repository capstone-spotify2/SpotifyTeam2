Lying face down, lying face down, in the gutter now, so damn proud.
Well I know, I know, I know, it's my fault, it's my fault.
<i>[x2]</i>

In a world where we all just waste away and suffer,
In a place you cry for today.

(We're all going mad.)

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.

Lying face down, lying face down, in the underground, so damn proud.
Well I know, I know, I know, it's my fault, it's my fault.

In a world where we all just waste away and suffer,
In a place you cry for today.

(We're all being brainwashed)

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.

Love, silence, and fade away.
Darkness, darkness, and decay.
A scarlet kiss and what to say.
Darkness, darkness, and decay.
<i>[x2]</i>

Believe, believe, believe in me.
Believe, believe, believe in me.

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
<i>[x3]</i>

Believe, believe, believe in me.
